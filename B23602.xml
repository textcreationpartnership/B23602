            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Right Institution of the Churches of Christ. That the Order and Government of those Churches, are Established by Divine Institution. What is the Nature of Divine Institutions, and how the Knowledge of them is conveyed to us; that Christ hath setled Ordinances for Worship, and Discipline, which are to continue unto the End of the World; that the Power of Church Censures, and Excommunication hath its Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in a more especial manner from Christ, as Head of the Church.</p>
               </argument>
               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>A Brief Scheme of the several Opinions concerning the Constitution, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Christ. The Truth Stated, and Vindicated.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF it were granted that the Churches in the New Testament, were formed and fixed Bodies, yet the question would still remain about the Tenure whereon they hold their Formation and Constitution; of what kind that Tenure is, whether of Divine Institution; and therefore it will be most Seasonable, and Conducing to the Understanding of all that follows, to give a general Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the several Opinions about Church Constitution, that are amongst us, ere we proceed.</p>
                  <p>There are three eminently differing Opinions, one of which will certainly prove to be the Truth of God, and which soever of them (when all of them are once throughly and fairly examined) shall be found to be the Truth, we shall Rejoyce, though it prove that we do suffer loss in our own.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Presbyterian Brethren hold the Institution of Church-State, to fall upon the whole universal Church, as one great Body by Institution; and then likewise upon all the parts thereof, according to the Division and Subdivision of the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to several Subordinations of greater and lesser Bodies, or fixed Assemblies, National, Provincial, Classical, or Congregational; so as the Universal Church on Earth being by Christs Institution, a Body Politick, and a Kingdom in the Total Consideration of it, and being a Similar Body, consisting of Similar or like parts for State and Condition, it becomes throughout such in all parts thereof. Even as every part of water hath the Nature of the whole, so every Integral Church, be it lesser or greater,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:154381:3"/> National, Provincial, Congregational, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they are all Churches, so in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, they are all of them Seats of Government by an equal Uniform, general Institution; and the whole being Ordained such, each part, by Association and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, doth become such also: For Christ by one great Charter granted to the whole, did at once Authorize and Endow all such particular Subordinations with Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power; only left the Distribution of this vast and great Common-Wealth and Pody Politick, into its parts greater or lesser, to be made by General Rules for Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Order, as the Law of Nature and Human Wisdom should see fit. But yet all is ordered with this Law, that the lesser Bodies should be subject to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, from top to bottom, and so all to the Church Universal, and the Judicature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; so as Judicatory Appeals might be made from the less to the greater, by vertue of this Divine Right granted to the whole. And this is said to have been the Scope of Christ in his first Institution, <hi>Tell the Church;</hi> and by it this kind of Power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being wholy given to the Elders of the Church, is to be Transacted by them in their Consistories and Associations, even from Congregational to General Councils, and is therefore only Practicable by the meetings of Elders chosen and sent from the lesser Assemblies to the greater, as Abstracted from, and without the convening of the Saints, whereof they are Elders; for Convention of all the particular Saints, is not only Unpracticable in those greater Bodies, but in Classical Assemblies too. And we do freely give this Testimony of Honour to this Opinion, that of all other grounds unto which the Presbyterian Divines have in these latter Days, when put to prove their Government, had Recourse, this is the most Consistent and Fairest Principle (if it could be proved) to rear up all their Subordinations at once, and to Endow the Constitution of them with a Divine Light, which as the Soul in the Body will be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Diffused through every part thereof, and which if it prove true, we must all turn Presbyterians.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some other Godly and Reverend Divines, who do with us wholy Reject any such Politick Modell, as an Invention of Man, (which Reareth up a Worldly Frame and Theater for Elders, through several Stairs, to enter upon the Heritage of the Lord) yet agree with our Presbyterian Brethren in this Principle of the Catholick Universal Church, being a Similar Body in the whole, and all the parts thereof. So that as a Congregation is in no further Respect or Consideration a Church, nor to any other End, Use, or Purpose, than is the Universal: So likewise the Warrant for, and the Priviledge of Congregational Churches, being a Seat for Ordinances and Elders, is but from the bare general Grant and Priviledge given to the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, which is one Day Ordained to meet together in Heaven, and should now on Earth Aspire to the State and Perfection thereof. And by vertue of this Canon-Law and Charter only, Saints gather into particular Churches, and enjoy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and all power of Government executed therein. So that the whole Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Order of Congregational Churches, is only by vertue of that General Law of Communion of Saints, without any further Superadded Institution of Christ, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Electively ordaining of all such other Bodies of Saints, to be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, or Endowing them with any further Priviledge or Power of Government, than the whole Body of Saints in the World hath. In a word, the Appointment of Congregational Bodies is according to this Opinion only virtual, and arising from the General grant to the Universal Church, and founded but upon the Common Law of the Communion of Saints. These two Opinions, though thus agreeing in that forementioned General Principle, yet do differ, as two Extreams. The one, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, diffuseth a pretended Instituted Policy too vastly, engaging all Saints, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches to Subject their Consciences, under pain of Excommunication, to the Determinations and Decisions of all the Clergy in the World; which is by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted as one Body, Inspired with this Soul of Government in all the Divisions of them, as parts of the whole; and such a Government may possibly issue in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Tyranny. The other whilst they betake themselves to the Common Priviledge of the Church Mystical and Universal, and meerly to that Law of Communion of Saints that is therein, doth hereby shut out and Exclude all Government or Censures, but such as the Common Law of Communion of Saints, and the Law of Nature common to all Societies, will admit, yea, and in the Consequence thereof, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all Institutions whatsoever of any such Discipline or Censures, whereof if particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations be found the Seat, those Congregations themselves also must be by Institution.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:154381:3"/> 3. We profess, (as in other things) so in this to run a middle way, which for ought we yet see, the Scripture chalks out to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We maintain that Assertion of a Church Universal, as the General Body of all, and that particular Churches are as parts thereof: Yet so as with our own <hi>Amesius</hi> (and others who have been Esteemed Orthodox Divines) we conceive that the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or consideration of Church, which the Universal Body of Saints stands under, is meerly and purely Mystical, and such also to be the Union and Communion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as with Christ, so of all the Members thereof among themselves. And further we Assert, this Notion or Name of Mystical Church, to be given not only to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible company of the Elect, and Real Members of Christ the Head; but to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible company of Professors of Christianity, that do walk as Saints, and are esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as such by Saints through the World. Unto whom as taken in the Lump and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward view, as Christ is reckoned to be an outward Head to them, as on Earth consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; so upon whom also taken in the lump and outward visibility, as well as upon the invisible company, the Notion of the Church Mystical may be put, it being in this Distinction opposed to a Church instituted, or that which is a politick Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We Assert, that untill the Mystical Body of the Elect shall meet together in Heaven, God hath appointed and ordained the visible Saints on Earth, being diffused over all the World, and thin Sown therein, to be knit together in particular Bodies, over which he hath appointed, Elders, Pastors, and Teachers, Officers by his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which Bodies consisting of both, should be the Publick Holders forth of his Truth and Worship, and the Subject of the Priviledge of all Ordinances, and Seats also of a Power and Government, for these Saints to be Subjected to, and Reduced in case of Scandalls; And the Honour of Christ is hereby to be vindicated, and his Ordinances kept pure, although there were no Christian Magistrates in the World, that would take Cognisance of such Scandalls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And further we conceive, that the gathering of Saints into such particular bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to Christ, thus to be the Seat of such Officers, Ordinances of Worship and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is by a General Institution and Endowment of Christ, over and above the Catholick Warrant of Communion of Saints, although including and taking in all the Rules and Laws thereof. And accordingly the measure and proportion and extent of these bodies, and what the limits and bounds thereof were to be, is set forth by Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; as also the Organization of this body, what kind of Officers or Original Members shall be in it. These are all to be found set out by him, as in his Wisdom he foresaw would best suit those ends which this Institution of such bodies of Saints should serve to, and as should be fitted to the Priviledges these bodies are endowed with; Christ having also (as to his own Institution he doth) made an answerable spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial blessing (which special promise of blessing doth indeed, if there were no more, make an Institution and Ordinance of that thing to which 'tis made) of being with such Assembl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="3 letters">

                  <p n="4">4. These Instituted bodies of Churches, we humbly conceive to be, for the bounds and proportion, or measure of them, only Congregational, which are the fixed Seat and Subject of all Ordinances of Worship, and who are the Seat of all sorts of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers or Organical Members, that serve for the use of the whole; and that these also, by and with their Officers, are the sole Seat of that Government, and the Acts thereof, which may more properly be termed Government, <hi>i. e.</hi> that is, judicially to bind the Soul, (which is acco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And these bodies thus Endowed hath Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154381:4"/> Heaven. And thus over and above the general Communion of Saints, there are, and ought to be, by Christs Institution, Political, Ecclesiastical Bodies or Churches, that are the Seat of a Spiritual Government, wherein we joyn with the first Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And yet we further affirm, that out of the Circuit and Bounds of these institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Priviledged Seats for Worship and Government, taking all these Saints, Elders, and Churches, whether in a City, Province, Nation, yea, the whole World, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them as so considered, that Common Law of the Mystical Communion of Saints, which the Catholick Relation obligeth to, takes place; so that as there is a Law of single Communion and Non-communion, between Saint and Saints, in case of offence, so between Church and Church, or greater or lesser Combinations of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as occasion is, or may be, of intercourse either way. And therein Churches proceed with Churches, not <hi>politicè,</hi> or as Arm'd by Christ with a Judicial Power of giving up to <hi>Satan;</hi> but they proceed and deal each with other, <hi>modo Mystico,</hi> or with a Moral Declarative Power only; which Law of Mystical Communion, yet obligeth them to all the same Duties for Substance, each to other, that that Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Power obligeth them in a Congregation unto. And thus far we also joyn with the second Opinion, Humbly professing, that either to make the Church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal in the whole, and all the parts, to be a Political Instituted Body, Arm'd with Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as the first Opinion doth; or on the other side, to make the Communion and Power in Congregational Bodies, and the Institution thereof, to be but Virtual, from what is given to the Church Universal, and but similar thereunto, as the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Opinion doth; to be both of them mistaken: apprehending much rather the Truth, to lye in a Communion of Saints here on Earth, compounded and made up (for the kind thereof) of both kinds of constitution; the one a fixed instituted and political Communion, superadded to the obligation of the Mystical Relation of Saints one to another, as such, and this to be in and between the Members of a particular Congregation; the other simply Mystical, and Moral, and Occasional, and that to be between Congregations each with other, and indeed between all the Churches in the World. So as whilst these Saints are knit and united into such parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches, for the Enjoyment of Ordinances, with power to preserve them pure, they yet are both, as Saints, and as a Church to hold all sorts of correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and are by Christ obliged to all sorts of Communion, and which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we do profess to hold and maintain with all Saints and Churches, according to the several Degrees of Purity amongst them.</p>
                  <p>This being a true Scheme, and general prospect of the several Opinions amongst us, the particulars of all which we shall in order pursue in this Discourse, in such a due Method as may conduce most to clear the Truth; I shall now apply my self to consider, whether these particular Churches, or fixed Bodies of Saints and Elders, (whether Congregational or Classical, or what ever else they shall prove to be) are to hold their constitution and formation by any special Divine Institution. For the clearing of which, we shall have occasion first to have to do with that principle fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, whether over and above the General Charter of the Church universal, and the Laws and Rules of the Communion of Saints belonging thereunto there is not a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded Institution, for the constitution of particular Churches, and for the endowing them with these Priviledges, which as Churches is found to be bestowed upon them; and then we shall prove, that even the setting forth the bounds and limits of those Bodies, the extensive power of Elders, and measure and proportion of these Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that are the Seat of Government, must also necessarily be set forth by such a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Divine Institution.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>That the Constitution of a Church, and the Rules of its Order and Government, are Established by a certain Institution of Christ. Some Propositions laid down in order to the Demonstration of this Truth.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Church universal, is a Church by an higher ground than by that Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is rather the Object of Gods Decree. And their meeting in Heaven, and making a general Assembly, is not so much by virtue of a command, or by appointment declared in his Revealed Will, as by a Decree of his secret will, and through the Efficacious Power of it, the same that raiseth them, wraps them up in the Clouds, and after carries them to Heaven, and presents them together at latter day, as it is said of Christ, <hi>Ps.</hi> 2. As their Worship, there is only natural Worship, not any thing that belongs to the second Command, so, nor is their meeting by virtue of that command. But now if all the Saints on Earth were no more than could meet in one place, yet that these should meet as a Church for such and such Ordinances, which in Heaven they shall not have, this must needs be from an Institution of Christ's, over and above their being the Church in general; as the Ordinances themselves are Established by such an Institution. For they gather together in his Name, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate in his Name, as well as they Baptize in his Name; and therefore if Baptism be an Institution, their gathering together must be an Institution also. And indeed if the Government and the Worship be by Institution, the seat or subject must needs be so. As if the Officers and the Laws of a Colledge or Incorporate Town be by a Law and a Charter, the Colledge or Incorporation it self, the form of it, and warrant to be so, must be much more. Nothing in any Kingdom depends more upon a Charter and the Supream Authority, than the imbodying of Men into societies, and the enabling them to Act in them. And so the constitution of these Spiritual Bodies, the Churches, hath a necessary dependency on this Authority of Christ. Those Bodies to be ruled, they are called the House of God, and the Church of God. <hi>If he Rule not his own House well, how shall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. Why is it called the Church of God, but because of Gods Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Lords Supper, and the Lords Day, have their Names from the Lords Institution? And it is called the House of God, and the Temple of God; and as the Temple was by Institution, so this Church of Christ too.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, that to which a promise is, for that there is a command; which is all one with an Institution; and an Institution is conveyed in a promise. In the Old Testament all their Solemn Assemblies, (which were the Types of ours) were by an Institution, both who, and where, and how, as those for Worship in the Temple, the <hi>Synhedrim</hi> for Government; therefore the things Typified much more.</p>
                  <p>But farther, what the Apostles did teach the Saints to become, for that there is an Institution; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ey taught nothing but what Christ commanded them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28 <hi>ult.</hi> And when they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ad taught them to become Churches, they wrote to them as such, and the Holy Ghost owneth them as such. And the Holy Ghost did Ordain, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, Pastors and Teachers, and set them as Overseers over each Flock, as an whole Flock, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Therefore ordained the bounds of their Flocks too.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Seven Churches are Seven Candlesticks, whereof the Type was the Candlestick of God, made by Gods Appointment. In the Candlestick there were two things, 1. <hi>Matter,</hi> which was Gold, that they should be Saints. 2. <hi>Forme,</hi> which is therefore Christ's Institution, to be cast into such or such a Mould. And for one Candlestick then, there are many Candlesticks now. Seven in, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20. And the Form of these many are now as well from Christ, as the Form of that one then was.</p>
                  <p>And as it is Gods House, he hath not left it unto Man to Frame his building to what proportion he pleaseth; Christs body Instituted, (which is Resembled unto the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, throughout the Epistles) is to have set Limits of it, a <hi>Maximum quod sit;</hi> and as the Natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ody▪ if it have all the parts that can have communion natural in the same common Acts of Nature together, though it be never so small, is a perfect body, so it hath also a prescription of bigness, and bounds are set it, both for parts, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:154381:5"/> a <hi>Maximum quod sit,</hi> for proportion of stature, which none should exceed. Thus Christ hath also constituted his Body the Church, in a due measure and proportion.</p>
                  <p>But to make a distinct demonstration, that the Form, and Order of Congregational Churches is of Christ's Institution, I shall proceed in this Method.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. I shall prove that God hath not left the Government of his Church to be ordered by the Laws of Nature, or the Arbitrary Maximes of Humane Reason, but hath prescribed Rules for it by his own Institution.</item>
                     <item>2. I shall shew what is the nature of a Divine Institution.</item>
                     <item>3. I shall describe the ways whereby Christ hath derived his Institutions to us, to ascertain us that they are Genuinely his own.</item>
                     <item>4. I shall demonstrate the Order, and Worship, and Ordinances of the Churches of Christ, to be of a perpetual continuance.</item>
                     <item>5. I shall prove that Excommunication, being more than Non-communion or casting out of the Church, hath in it a super-added Institution of Christ.</item>
                     <item>6. I shall at last shew that a Congregational Church, is by Christ's Institution the only Subject, and Seat of Church Government; and the Grand Charter of the Power of the Keys is granted to it alone.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. To prove that Christ hath not left his Churches destitute of Rules for her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but hath established them in his Divine Word of the Scriptures, I shall lay down, and demonstrate these following Propositions.</p>
                  <p>Propsition I. <hi>That the Right Government of a Church, is a part of Worship under the New Testament;</hi> which is evident;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because all means of Worship are called <hi>The Keys of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16. 18, 19. And by Excommunication Men Bind and Loose, as well as by Preaching or by Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. This Act of Government, Excommunication, is parallell'd with Prayer; The Agreement of the Church to cast out is parallell'd with this, <hi>What two shall agree to ask,</hi> Mat. 18. 19. 3. Excommunication is done in the Name of Christ and in the Power of Christ, which is the same thing that makes Baptism a part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? <hi>Baptize them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. So as the Lord's Supper also is constituted. 4. In <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. all is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, reasonable Worship, which referreth to Ruling afterward, as well as Teaching and Exhorting. And 5. If a contribution to uphold the Ministry, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to poor Christians, be called a Sacrifice, and a Service done unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12. (the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) then Church censures also as well may have that name; and therefore must have a rule for them as well as other parts of Worship. And therefore now to determine as who shall Baptize, and who shall Administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, depends upon his having a Power to do it; so to determine who shall Excommunicate, there is some Rule to direct us.</p>
                  <p>Prop. II. <hi>The Law of Nature is not sufficient to set up any thing which is parallel to a Divine Institution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for example. If the Government of Congregations by Elders and Officers be in a particular Congregation set up by Divine Institution; No Law of Nature alone will be ground enough to erect the like Power in any other company of Elders, if they have not that other by Institution. The Laws of Nature may indeed direct us how to manage Ordinances that Christ hath erected, according to the common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in which those Ordinances partake with other things civil. As if that there be many Prophets in a Church, the Law of Nature will teach that they should not speak many at once, because it is against the end of Prophecying; but the Laws of Nature would not be sufficient to erect an Order of Prophecy in the Church, which Jesus Christ hath not appointed, although Speech is a natural means to persuade by. The Laws of Nature will also teach us to take the benefit of Ordinances, if they be Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Christ. As supposing that Christ had appointed a Superiour Power, a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Court over Churches, having the same Power which the Churches have: The Laws of Nature would have taught me to have made use of this, but would never have warranted the erection of such, armed with the same Power, if Jesus Christ should not be found to have appointed it. The Proposition is evident by these Reasons;</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:154381:5"/> 1. Because that Institutions and Ordinances flow from Christ, not as the Author of Nature, but as the Author of Grace, as Lord and King of his Church, and so depend upon his Will; if therefore he by his Will have made one institution, the Laws of Nature cannot make a parallel to it, and parallel it is if it be supposed to have the same power and influence that the other hath which Christ hath instituted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nothing can work beyond its own Sphere; And therefore, tho' the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be sanctified to subserve the institutions of Christ, yet not to raise up any thing anew parallel to an institution of Christ. A Spiritual Court parallel to such a Spiritual Court as Christ hath instituted, is what exceedeth the power of Nature, as truly as that it is not in the power of Nature to produce a Spiritual Act of Grace, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to what the Holy Ghost produceth. Natural gifts, and natural parts may be subservient unto Grace that sanctifieth them, but they cannot produce or educe the least Spiritual Act. And thus Christ's Government excludeth not Nature, but will take in the help of it, but exceeding it; Nature cannot be the rise of any part of it.</p>
                  <p>Prop. III. <hi>That there must be a special Divine Institution for the Government of the Churches of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For all Church Power and Government which hath a Spiritual punishment annexed to it, must be by special Institution; and that is in a special manner Government, by a Divine Institution, which hath a Power annexed to it, to inflict a Spiritual punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond what is in the common nature of the act it self to do. And therefore although to withdraw from every brother that walketh inordinately, be from the common Law of Christianity, in all sorts of Arbitrary converse; yea and to throw out of a fixed Body or Society, to have power to do so, be from the common and ordinary nature of all other Societies, if the Laws of those Societies be so and so transgressed; yet that there should be a delivering over to Satan with the Power of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, that this should be annexed to the casting of a Man out, this is apparently by Special Institution, for no Body of Men by the common Law of Nature could have power so to do. So also although upon all admonitions there is a binding the Sin upon the Conscience, so far forth as the nature of the Sin is laid upon it, which is common to all other reproofs of any kind in other sorts: Yet that there should be a promise that where such and such, rather than others, do bind Sin upon a Man's Conscience on Earth, by their Sentence and Judgment, this Sin is also bound upon them in Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. this must be from an Institution superadded. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ's Will that this should be done by such and such, be apparent to us by an express command in the Letter of it, or is held forth in some example or some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which do imply it: Yet it is an Institution because it holds forth a supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral efficacy. For whatsoever is set apart by God Electively, and cull'd out from other things to be the instrument of a supernatural power and efficacy, that is such by Divine Institution; and all such power as is thus supernatural, must be disposed of and executed according to his Mind, by his own instruments, and where he hath placed it. Every man is to admonish his Brother upon that common ground, that he is to love him and not to hate him; this is a common ground belonging to all sorts of Men whatsoever; but that any select company of Men should be peculiarly singled out to have power to admonish a Man, to bind Sin upon him, this is from the Institution of Christ. And that they should have the promise of the power of Jesus Christ to accompany them, that this should be in order to a throwing the Sinner out, and a delivering him up to Satan if he repent not, this is from Christ's Institution. Thus God doth take things that by the common Law of Christianity do serve for such an end, and yet over and above puts an Institution upon them to serve for some special end in such away, by such and such persons; as in those instances given of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and admonishing by any Christian, which serveth to a Spiritual end, he takes it up to be performed in a Church and by Elders in publick, in a more special manner, to have a further efficacy in it, because he hath put a further Institution upon it. Thus also the gifts out of out which Men Preach and Pray, they are common to multitudes of Men, and are given in a providential way, and not by Institution; but yet that Men should exercise these by way of Office, in a constant selected way, and separated hereunto, this is by special Institution. So likewise God doth take such things as have a ground in the Law of Nature, and over and above stamps his Institution upon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154381:6"/> them in a supernatural way further than naturally they serve to. So that Christ's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions they do not exclude natural grounds, but comply with them, only ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate them, cause them to exceed their natural power and force, with a peculiar efficacy and blessing, and so fall in with the Rules of Nature. Thus that not two or three should speak at once in a Church, it is in it self a Law of Nature common to all men, that Women should not speak in publick, but be silent, it is the Law of Nature; yet over and above they are delivered as the Commands of God, which he that is Spiritual acknowledgeth as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. It is the Law of Nature that no Man should War upon his own Charges, that the Labourer is worthy of his Hire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Apostle alledgeth these for Ministers Maintenance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. and yet withal addeth, so I ordain in all the Churches, and makes an Institution of it. And for the due companies of Men to meet and assemble themselves together; and no more to assemble than can meet in one place to be edified by Ordinances, agrees with that Law of Nature that is common to it as to other things. But yet this which had but a natural and moral foundation, hath Jesus Christ now made an Institution of, and hath therefore put His own Name upon it, and called it, <hi>A gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together in his Name,</hi> and he hath enabled them with a power beyond the power of nature in the throwing of a Man out, for it is to give him up to Satan.</p>
                  <p>So also in the judging of a Man for having committed a sin there is always a kind of censure. In a large sense indeed, <hi>Vita est censura,</hi> and thus a man condemns and censures another by his practice and example, and so a Godly Man doth judge Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, and they are reproved and judged by all the Saints; but there is also a special judicature out of Authority, and the power of Jesus Christ accompanying of it, namely that spoken of in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. when he saith, <hi>Do not ye judge those that are within? What have I to do to judge them that are without?</hi> Therefore this is by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Institution. And in this place of the <hi>Corinths</hi> compared with, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering way of Judgment, one by way of Institution, and the other by way of the common Law of Nature, seems to be held forth by the Apostle himself, for when he comes to speak of judging the incestuous person for his sin, with a spiritual power, the Power of the Lord Jesus, he makes that a setled Government, do not ye judge them that are within? As they were a Body to Christ. But when in <hi>chap.</hi> 6. he speaks of taking up differences about things of this Life, though he would have the Saints do it among themselves by way of Arbitration, and not to carry it out of themselves (for the sake of avoiding scandal) to Heathen Magistrates, yet this latter he doth found only on the Canon Law: It is not an Ordinance though it was Christ's Will and Command it should be in that case. Therefore he doth not bid them go to the Elders to take up differences, or to the whole Church, but he bids them take whom they would, the least Saint, who is able to judge, upon that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ground of ability, whereby one day they shall be able to judge the World. So that this latter was only occasional, and by way of Arbitration, according to the Law of Nature, whereas the other was a constant and setled Government, and that invested with spiritual power supernatural, which the other is not.</p>
                  <p>All the duties that are performed in a Church they are duties amongst all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by the common Law of Christianity; for by the Law of Love, they are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, to pray for, to reprove, to avoid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as occasion is: But that all these should be performed in a publick body of Saints, gathered together, not occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but fixedly, and that special persons should have the power or part of the power committed to them, separated thereunto, and that it should be done in such and such an order; all this both because of the constancy of it, of the electiveness of it, and the special power and efficacy that doth accompany it over and above what is promised in an ordinary way to the common Law of Christianity; must needs be an Institution.</p>
                  <p>So that whatsoever be the subject or the instrument in a constant and elective way of a supernatural power, or a supernatural Administration over and above what is common to all Christians, or Societies of Men; that Power must be placed by Institution, whoever hath it, or wherever it is. It is not a supernatural quality indeed, but it is a relative respect, whereby a company of Men are called by God, and enabled unto a supernatural administration, which a special efficacy shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company; and so by vertue of God's Promise it is concomitantly a supernatural power, though not inherent.</p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:154381:6"/>
                  <p> And yet it is not so to be understood, as if that such a power should always, for the effect, have that Efficacy that it is assigned to, for that is as God pleaseth. He works not as natural Agents do, because God's promise to accompany his Ordinances is in a free way; as in Preaching the Word, though it is an Ordinance, yet it had not always the effect, though Christ himself, and the Apostles Preached it: It might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have an issue indeed one way or other, and be a means to condemn Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they receive it not; but it had not always that effect, for which it was more principally and directly appointed, as natural Agents have.</p>
                  <p>And so on the other side, we deny not but that Admonitions and other means which run according to the Law of the New Creature and Christianity, which one Saint is to perform to another, may have the like effects, through Gods Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Excommunication hath, to bind sin upon a Mans conscience, give him up to Satan to terrifie him, and the like; even as God also may bless private instructions, yea, the private Example of a private Christian to Convert an Heathen, yea, and that also when his own Ordinance will not do it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. But yet still Church Admonition, and Excommunication, is an Ordinance in a special manner, which the other is not. So as because that Gods Power Supernaturally must concur for the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of what it is Ordained for, hence therefore it must be seated, where God would have it be, by a special Institution, and not misplaced, or else he will not work in it, and with it. If a Man had stirred the Waters, God would not have wrought; or if Satan had done it, he would not have wrought; but when the Angel did it, he did, <hi>John</hi> 5. 4. All such Supernatural Administrations they are limited; as the power is from God, so in whom this power should be, is also from him, and by his Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Though Magistrates are the Ordinance of God in this General Respect, that it is his Will and Command, that there should be Magistrates; yet the power that God accompanieth Magistrates withal in their Administration, is not Supernatural to those ends for which they are appointed, farther than in this proportion, as in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral he hath appointed Magistrates to be his Vicegerents. And hence therefore, what sort of Magistrates to have, whether Monarchical, or Aristocratical, of what extent their Dominions shall be, and the like, is still left to Men; because the power that the Magistrate hath of any kind, it is indeed executively but the power of the People committed to him, and betrusted to him, whose power he acts, so as what he pardons the People pardon, what he punisheth the People punish; the Peoples power is engaged in it; and hence as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, in <hi>the Word of a King there is power, Eccles.</hi> 8. 4. Hence they are called Humane Creations, though an Ordinance of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. But that Supernatural Ecclesiastical power, that Jesus Christ doth appoint, is not simply an Ordinance, that there should be Ministers in the general, that shall have this or that power, leaving it unto Men to appoint what sort of Ministers, whether in a way of Monarchy, or in a way of Aristocracy, whether Popes, or Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so likewise as to the Seat or Relation over which these Officers shall have power, and the extent of it. But these must be all Divine Creations and Institutions, as the sort of Magistrates and extent of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths is a Humane Creation. If the power that these did manage, were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately the power of Men, or given to them by the Church, as that of Magistrates is by the Common-wealth, then indeed the several Administrations might be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Men, and the bounds thereof set forth; for the power they have, would be proportioned to the cause or rise of it. Magistrates as they have their power thus from Men by Humane Creation, so the punishments that they inflict are but corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral punishments, which the People that set them up can inflict. Indeed Rebellion against the lawful Magistrate, works Damnation in the Issue, by consequence, because it is a sin against the general Ordinance of God; but yet it is, but as any other sin brings Damnation. But now in Church power, there is a special Supernatural Efficacy of God, immediately accompanying it; and therefore this power, as it can no way be delegated by the Person or Persons that have it, so as they should make any one Vicars or Substitutes to execute it for them, as the Bishops do the Chancellors; so also by the same ground, it cannot be placed or seated, but where Christ would have it by his Commission. For if the persons that already have it from Christ, cannot give it unto another, than to whom Christ hath appointed, or to any other body or society, than Christ hath appointed, and hath by Institution placed it, then assuredly neither Magistrates, nor any company of Men whatsoever, can place it but where he would have it.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:154381:7"/>
                  <p> And surely for Excommunication of all other (if for any other Ordinance) there must be an Institution, and by whom it shall be Administred in a certain way defined; because of all Ordinances, it is the greatest. If therefore for Preaching, who shall Administer it, and where, there is an Institution; then certainly for this, for this is an Act of meer Authority. To Preach is an Act of gift also, and he that hath gifts, may for the materiality of Preaching, perform all that a Minister doth out of gifts; but the Act of delivering to Satan, and the Act of throwing a Man out, are Acts of meer power; do cast him out of all Ordinances, and therefore of all Ordinances they are the greatest: And besides that, it is delivering to Satan with the power of Christ, which who can assume, but those to whom Christ hath committed it? It is to a spiritual end; and it is not therefore enough to say, that if there be nothing in the Word against it, but that these and these may Excommunicate, that then they may do it; no, there must be something in the Word positive for it, and that limiteth it, and here placeth it. It will otherwise be a nullity, for want of commission in the persons that do it.</p>
                  <p>And if that Excommunication were not so an Institution, as that also the sort of Persons to whom it is to be performed, should be by Institution, and were not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering up to Satan also; then the Magistrate could inflict it, as well as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Church, for he can cast Men out of such and such a Society, and keep Men from Ordinances, as well as they.</p>
                  <p>Hence Excommunication being an Ordinance, depending wholly upon Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that which makes Ecclesiastical Authority to be properly Government and Jurisdiction, lying in a power so to Excommunicate; none may therefore take upon them to Administer this Ordinance, without a special Commission and Institution; And in this lies the knot of the difference in the controversie.</p>
                  <p>Prop: IV. <hi>Gods Institution must put an Efficacy into all Censures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing in Nature hath further perfection in it, than God hath put into it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more this holds in power Ecclesiastical. Man cannot limit that power of Ministry, which he cannot give. All Church censures they are accompanied with a Supernatural power, as the word of God is, which hath not in it self a power inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to work without the Spirit accompany it. There is this difference between Civil power and Ecclesiastical; that though Gods power doth accompany the civil power of the Magistrate, because it is his Ordinance, yet he doth not accompany the Acts thereof Supernaturally; but the power that accompanieth the Magistrates Acts, is the power of the People in whose Name Magistrates execute it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Magistrates be resisted, the whole People are obliged to back and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en him. But here now the Ministerial power is ordained to convey a special Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Efficacy from God, and Ministers do work wholly in his power: <hi>The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Warfare, are mighty through God, having in us a readiness to revenge all Disobedience,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5, 6. As therefore if the powers of a Kingdom are ingaged in the sentence of any Court, it must be because they have set it up and confined it, and given commission, and appointed who should execute it, so as if any should exercise a power further then they have appointed, they were not ingaged to back it; so, nor will God also assist with his power further than as he hath placed it, and where he hath placed it.</p>
                  <p>Prop. V. <hi>That the Constitution of Churches is Uniform, and of one kind and sort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Churches are of a like sort, and, for their Constitution and Government, are uniform:</p>
                  <p>Or else, 1. There should be a double constitution, one for the one sort, and the other for the other. And therefore a Classicall, and Congregational Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two several sorts of Churches, in respect of their end, the one being for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the other for Government; the one a Representative Church (for so the Elders in a <hi>Classis</hi> are) the other of the People, or consisting of People and Elders both; and being all so truly several Forms of Churches in respect of Government, as Oeconomical Government differs from Political, and the like, they cannot both of them be by Divine Institution.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:154381:7"/>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> In the <hi>Jewish</hi> Government, both small Towns, and great had entire power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Therefore therein lay their Uniformity; and whilst power was lodged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Elders, and they kept Court in the Gate, it might be so, and the same Order be preserved; but it cannot be so here, when the People also are by Institution taken in, and are to be present.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Apostle saith, <hi>So I Ordain in all the Churches,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17. there could not be the same Ordination of Government and Constitution, unless there were an uniformity in these Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again; Christ writing to the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> in 2 &amp; 3. <hi>chap. Rev.</hi> He not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calls them seven Candlesticks, as being all of the same make, uniform, of the same parts and the like; but what he writes to one, he writes to all that were Churches, concluding all his Epistles thus, <hi>Hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches,</hi> which is all one with what is in, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>I sent mine Angel to testifie these things in the Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And it is argued from that common Type of the visible Churches, which is shewn unto <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 4. As the Form of the Tabernacle was shewn unto <hi>Moses</hi> in <note place="margin">Parkerus <hi>De polit. Eccles. lib.</hi> 3.</note> the Mount; where there are 24. Elders, and 4. Beasts; and the Acts they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, are principally Worship, and therefore it is the Form of Congregational Churches.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Of <hi>Thessalonica</hi> he saith, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>That they became followers of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of God, which in</hi> Judea <hi>are in Christ Jesus;</hi> if it had been meant only of following of them in matters of Faith, in receiving of the Gospel in the Doctrine of it, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular Christian doth, he needed not have used the Phrase, <hi>Followers of the Churches, but of the Church in</hi> Judea, if it had been spoken in respect, as they were Members of the visible Church, visible professors of Christianity. He speaks it therefore also, in reference to having received the Gospel, and casting themselves, as a Church, into the same form and constitution with those Churches; for by reason of their form and constitution, they are called Churches, as they are Bodies gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up for Worship and Government.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For the confirmation of this, add, that the Institution cannot fall both upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational and classical, but one would destroy the other, if it were left arbitrary, to take one or the other.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As one Baptism, one Body, one Faith, are in the Church Mystical; so one sort of Body, as well as one Baptism, for kind, is Instituted in the constitution of the Churches of Christ.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That Christ hath by his own Institution, Established the Order, Discipline, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Churches; proved by several Arguments.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS there is a Distinction commonly made between Discipline, and Worship, and Doctrine of the Church, so such a Distinction hath an Apostolical stamp upon it for its warrant; for materially we find it, though in other Terms, <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 5. Where by Order among them, he means that which we call Discipline, or ordering the Administration or Government of the Church and Worship: And by Faith, that which we call Doctrine, or the Systeme of Truths to be believed and practised, for so every where the word is used. And so in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 34. Having Treated of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pertaining to Worship and Discipline, the Administration of the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he concludes, <hi>the rest will I set in order when I come.</hi> So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. <hi>Let all be done Decently,</hi> which respects the outward circumstances; <hi>and according to Order,</hi> which respects those Apostolical commands about matters of Discipline, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he calls them, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. such as he had given in that Chapter, and at other times. Therefore, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. when writing to an <hi>Evangelist</hi> about Rectifying matters in Crete, and ordaining Elders in every City, matters that concern Discipline, he adds, <hi>as I had Ordered thee, or given Order to thee.</hi> The word is the same in all these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And by Order, he means not simply their having all those principally instituted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154381:8"/> Ordinances as are Essential, as Preaching the Word, Sacrament, and Censure, and Officers to Administer these; but all such Rules as the Apostles gave for the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and administring those Ordinances right; many of which Rules are; more than meer external circumstances; and yet not principal Ordinances, but Directions to manage Ordinances, as even those Directions given about prophecying in that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. That they should speak by course, and one at once, that the Women should keep silence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which yet are points of that Order, he would have them observe in their Assemblies, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. And so in the Old Testament, there was the like usage. As they had the Ark, so they had direction how to carry it, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 2. None ought to carry the Ark but the <hi>Levites,</hi> for them hath the Lord chosen; and because they carryed it in a Cart, he tells them they sought not the Lord after the due Order, <hi>v.</hi> 13. Now for the Demonstration of this, that the Order of the Churches of Christ is to be distinguished from▪ their Doctrine and Worship.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider; that very place it self, even now cited for this Distinction, doth, if viewed, in the context of it, afford Argument for this, the Apostle delighting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with a rare and worthy sight, worthy an Apostle's Joy, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Though I be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Flesh, yet am I present with you in the Spirit, joying and beholding your Order, and the stedfastness of your Faith in Christ.</hi> Whereby <hi>Spirit,</hi> if his own mind and heart be meant, then the meaning is, that both those were Established according to his own Heart, as he an Apostle led by the Holy Ghost would have them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he says, he was present with them in his Spirit. Or if the Holy Ghost be meant more immediately, then the meaning is, that in respect of those, the same Spirit of Christ that dwelt in the Apostle, and guided him in setling the Church in both these, was present also with them in both <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> both being Established and Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led amomg them according to the Dictates of the Holy Ghost in the Apostle; and therefore he says, he was <hi>present with them in the Spirit, joying in a Spiritual manner to behold both.</hi> So that the <hi>Colossians</hi> had all Ordinances and Officers, and all those Ordinances managed by those Officers amongst them, according to the Directions the Holy Ghost had given. This was their <hi>Order</hi> he rejoyceth in, as well as in their <hi>Faith,</hi> and is in respect of both these present with them in Spirit. And this being their present State in both, he exhorts them to continue herein, in those words, <hi>As ye therefore have received Christ the Lord, so walk ye in him, ver.</hi> 6. He speaks in Relation to both these, for his Scope is to exhort them to persevere in what he had before commended them for, which hitherto they had held on in; which was for their <hi>Order,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith,</hi> which the Particle <hi>therefore</hi> implies, <hi>as ye have therefore received, so walk.</hi> And as in their Faith they had received Christ Jesus for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, so in submitting to his Orders and Rules for their Church Government, they had received him for their Lord; and to walk on in both as they had begun, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them. So that all Churches then, as they had received from the Apostles the Doctrine of Faith, so directions for Order too, and it was not left to their power, to their Arbitrement, to innovate or alter in either, but to continue to walk as they had begun.</p>
                  <p>And this further appears to have been his Scope, because he prefaceth this commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their Faith and Order, that he might preserve them from the Errours of some who went about to pervert them in both. Into the Order of their Worship, there were those that would have obtruded <hi>Jewish</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, of absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meats, and of Holy Days, and the <hi>Jewish</hi> Sabbath, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. and so a seeking God after the old Order of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church. And into the Doctrine of their Faith, there were some that would have introduced things they had not seen, <hi>v.</hi> 18. by which Doctrines they destroyed the foundation of their Faith, not holding the head, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. Now to settle them against these Innovations both in Doctrine and Rites, and against all whatsoever that might arise of the like kind, to the end of the World, he tells them that they were in respect of that Order and Faith they had received Christ in, in him compleat, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. He and his word was a sufficient director to to them in both; and they needed neither to be beholden to Humane Philosophy or Policy, or any Traditions of Men, either to order their Churches for them, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as Christ by his Apostles had Taught, or to coin new Doctrines. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. And because that take them, <hi>quà Colentes,</hi> as Worshippers in a Church, they were dead with Christ from all Rudiments of the World whatever, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. he wonders that any among them should be so seduced, and <hi>why as though living in the</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:154381:8"/>
                     <hi>World they would be subject to Ordinances, humane of what kind soever.</hi> Where he takes away the fairest pretence for such Innovations as could be; that they, because Men as well as others, lived in the World (the example of which is apt to mould Men much to conform to their practices) and therefore they should take liberty to loose their Orders in their Church affairs, to come the nearer to the Model of Wordly Governments. Ay, but the Apostle tells them that they were Worshippers in a Church that held of Christ as their only Lord, they were of another World, and so ought not to subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to any matters of Order, as well as matters of Faith in their Church Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations, but what were purely from Christ. And in relation to both these (which he still carries in his Eye) he useth two words, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Not to go after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Men, in matters of Order; nor the Doctrines of Men, in matters of Faith,</hi> (for still such new invented ways profit not the Soul but perish in the using) <hi>nor be deceived by the vain shew of what Wisdom soever appeared in either.</hi> And although the swervings and aberrations there mentioned from right Order and Faith, were more gross than many of those amongst us, yet the arguments and exhortations the Apostle useth (to prevent any of what sort soever for ever) are such as reach ours and all other digressions from the right Order and Faith, at first delivered by the Apostle, and received by the Apostolick Churches, and we are to reduce all to the Word, we being compleat in Christ for either. The like Exhortation unto this (which further strengtheneth this) we have also <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I add to this, that there are in the Books of the New Testament written by the Apostles, manifold particular directions and notes, purposely and professedly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to direct in the Government of Churches▪ and ordering the Worship of them. Thus in the Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which is an Historical Narration, and in the Epistles, there are divers and several passages scattered, which put together will rise up to a Platform, whereas for ordering of Commonwealths there are only general Rules, as <hi>to be subject to the higher Powers,</hi> &amp;c. but neither directions nor examples left or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated how they are to be governed. Thus in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. he gives many directions about the publick Prayers of the Church, as for their Order, that they should be first made afore any other, <hi>That first of all, Prayers be made,</hi> ver. 1. So for their kind, all sorts of Prayers, <hi>Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions,</hi> &amp;c. For their subject, for all Men, <hi>Kings, all in Authority;</hi> for the place of Worship, not in places dedicated as Holy with difference from others as the Temple was, but <hi>I will that Prayers be made every where,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. For the carriage of Women, that in the Publick Assemblies they wear Modest Apparel, and not affect that splendour, and costliness as elsewhere, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. and that they keep silence in all administrations whatever, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and that they be not Rulers nor Teachers of the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Then in <hi>chap.</hi> 3. he gives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about Officers; their Distinction, Bishops and Deacons; their qualifications when to be chosen. And <hi>chap.</hi> 5. he adds many more of the like nature, both about Officers and Church Censures. And what was the scope of all this? Even to shew that the ordering and disposing of all such things, are fixed some where or other in the writings of the Apostles, and left as Rules for us by Apostolick Authority. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the conclusion of all this, doth more strongly enforce his former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>These things write I unto thee (hoping to come unto thee shortly</hi> (and so not writing all that might be written now) <hi>but if I tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thy self in the House of God, which is the Church of the Living God.</hi> He puts an Emphasis upon the Subject he was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse in, <hi>The House of God, and the Church of the Living God,</hi> as if he had said, the House or Family of God, and the ordering of it, requires another manner of skill than the Societies of Men. <hi>Timothy</hi> was an Evangelist, whose Office it was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Discipline and Doctrine in the Churches, which the Apostles first planted, and the Evangelists received extraordinary gifts to that end, and such gifts as made them to exceed, in Spiritual Wisdom and Spirit, all the Bishops, yea all the States in the World, and yet it was not left unto their Wisdom or Arbitrement, to dispose or give such directions as these in Church Affairs and Administrations; but they were tyed to the directions of the Apostles under whom they were Evangelists, and who were guided infallibly by the Spirit, that these Evangelists might be guided by them to mould Churches accordingly. <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Wisdom could not direct him herein, but he was to learn and know from <hi>Paul,</hi> that thou may'st know how to behave thy self, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. This is a skill then, which depends upon Apostolical Revelation. And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:154381:9"/> the directions were not so loosly given as they might vary from them, for <hi>Paul</hi> says even to <hi>Timothy, How thou oughtest to behave thy self,</hi> as a matter of duty. Neither doth <hi>Paul</hi> only give general Rules, which might help humane Wisdom in the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, for many of the Rules in that Epistle are particular, and as express as may be, not only directing to the substantial parts of Worship, but giving directions for the manner, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>How,</hi> implies. Yea and he makes these things part of that mystery of Godliness, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. for which Christ was made manifest in the Flesh and Ascended, as well as matters of Doctrine; and so they needed a revelation as well as the greatest truths of Faith. And further he insinuates the reason why he left these things in Writing, because the Spirit foretold that there should be an Apostacy of the Churches to Popery in the latter times, when there should be a perversion, as of the Doctrine, so of the Apostolical Order and Worship set up in the first Churches, he instancing in some particulars for the rest, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. which <hi>Daniel</hi> (whence he quotes it) instanceth in; <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 36, 39. And so he writ these things that the Church might in after Ages have a Rule to restore all things to the Primitive condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again.</p>
                  <p>The like we have delivered by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> another Evangelist, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>For this cause</hi> (says he) <hi>left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting,</hi> or as the word in the Original is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> throughly set straight or reduce to the right, things that were left unset right. And he instanceth in one matter of Discipline for all the rest, <hi>and ordain Elders in every City:</hi> And how was he to order all things? And by what rule? <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>as I ordered them to thee, or gave order.</hi> Evangelists were appointed for Church Discipline as well as Doctrine; so <hi>Timothy</hi> you see was by the directions given him, and so <hi>Titus</hi> was as appears by the following directions, and as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> implies, for that signifies the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of matters aright. And he was to make an exact or thorough Reformation, and to constitute things fully aright: And all this not according to rules of general Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Discretion, but according to particular and express order from the Apostle, <hi>as I gave order to thee.</hi> Now if the Apostle gave particular orders for all these things then, and that to abler and wiser Men than ever were to succeed in the Church, and they needed them; then if they have not left in their Writings some where or other all the directions they gave to them by Word of Mouth, there had not been sufficient provision made for us in these days, nor the succeeding Churches in all Ages, who know less how to behave our selves in the Church of God than they did.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Add to this that so usually cited place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. which comes fitly in to second this reason, and confirms it; As <hi>Moses</hi> is said to be faithful in all God's house, so Christ also both in God's and his own House; as <hi>Moses</hi> was under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so Christ is under the New; <hi>Moses</hi> was concerned in that old visible constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> (for so also, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38. it is called, The Church in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness.) And Christ in the new constituted, Assemblies of the Gospel. Even in the Language of that Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> as well as in this to <hi>Timothy,</hi> these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Assemblies are called, with respect to Christ, his House, For <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 21. The Apostle there shewing that as we have an High Priest now as they had then, so an House of God now as then, <hi>We having an High Priest over the House of God,</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from thence, that as we should draw near in Worship as the Priests did, having our Consciences sprinkled, and our Bodies washed with pure Water (following the allusion of the Worship in that old House) so we should go on with other duties of Church Fellowship, as inferences from thence, and among others, he brings in this last, <hi>Not forsaking the Assembling of our selves together.</hi> And his Argument lies thus, As there was an High Priest then, so now; as a Publick Worship then, so now; and as an House of God, and Assemblies then to exercise Publick Worship in, over <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25.</note> which the High Priest was placed, so there must be such an House now; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not National but Parochial, therefore he expresseth them by the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Now if such Congregations be God's House appointed for his Publick Worship under the New Testament, we needed particular directions how to behave our selves in this House of God, as much as the <hi>Jews</hi> of old did in that House which God built then for Publick Worship, as that place in <hi>Timothy</hi> shews, <hi>That thou mayest know how to behave thy self in the House of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. Yea and Christ also hath been as faithful to God in directing us now, as <hi>Moses</hi> was in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering all things then, as this place in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> shews. <hi>Moses</hi> was

Faithfullness implies going exactly according to Directions given, and Christ, his Faithfullness lay in giving out those Directions to us his Church. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it only in matters of Faith and manners; for it is spoken of <hi>Building God's House,</hi> under the New Testament, which is done by Ministry, and the Government of the Church also, as well as by Faith and Manners; for the Building and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church, is as well by the Ministry and Officers of the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 12. and all the Ordinances of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10▪ 26. as by the Doctrine of Faith and good Manners. Neither is the comparison of Christ with <hi>Moses,</hi> as to giving Rules for a Common-wealth, (and so this needs not be brought in for a Disproportion) but as to the House of God only, in which Christ only did meddle, and refused to be a Judge in other things: And herein as <hi>Moses</hi> is said to be faithfull <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the whole House; that is, in every particular about it, a compleat director of all things, in every Room of it; so must Christ be also in all sorts of things, that concerned it any way, as an House to God, whether as Mystical, in giving Doctrines to Build it; or visible and constituted, in giving Discipline. He was faithfull to God in the whole House; that is, in every thing therein, we are an House to God. Neither do we fetch an Argument from the particulars of Christ and <hi>Moses;</hi> but further from the very Reasons that the Apostles here suggests. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Reason says the Apostle, <hi>Every House is built by some Man, Heb.</hi> 3. 4. And for the building of it, there must be a Platform, and direction in some Man's Head; a Pattern there was for the Tabernacle, and for <hi>Solomon's</hi> Temple given by <hi>David,</hi> and that by the Spirit, as is warily put in, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 12, 13, 14. and the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness of him, that is to build this House, must lye in building it, according to that Pattern. Now this House of God, neither under the Old, or New Testament, could have Man for its builder; for no Man hath either power to do it, nor skill to give the Pattern; therefore, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. he says, That <hi>Moses,</hi> and all the Saints of the Old and New Testament, Apostles and others, were, and are but a part of the House; and so could not give of themselves directions to build it. Therefore as it is the House of God (both now and then) so God must be the Master-builder, as then so now; therefore, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. he both calleth Christ the builder of his House, in those words, he that built the House; and adds, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. That whereas Men build every other House, he that built this House, is God; but he that built all things, is God: Men love to have the contrivance of their Houses, to be drawn by themselves: and are as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in it, to please themselves, as in any other thing; and so Christ likewise.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To build, and give directions for the Building of God's Church, as unto <hi>Moses</hi> was given, he makes a matter of Honour and Prerogative due only to God and Christ, and shall Man Arrogate it? <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>This Man,</hi> (naming Christ) <hi>was counted worthy of more Glory than</hi> Moses <hi>was, in as much as he who hath Builded the House, hath more Honour than the House, ver.</hi> 3. under the word Building, he includes <hi>giving the Pattern,</hi> for <hi>Moses</hi> was but Faithful in doing then according to the Master Builder's Direction. Therefore to give but such kind of Directions for the Building and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering God's House under the New Testament, as <hi>Moses</hi> by Direction gave under the Old, about Church Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if Men should undertake it, would be to assume the glory of that Wisdom, that is due only to Christ. It was the Masterpiece where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Wisdom, (Christ's Type) is said to have been shewn, 2 Chron. 9. 3, 4, 5. <hi>When the Queen of</hi> Sheba <hi>had seen the Wisdom of</hi> Solomon, <hi>and the House that he had Built, the Meat of his Table, Attendence of his Servants, and so the rest of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his House,</hi> she professeth she had not heard the <hi>one half of the greatness of his Wisdom.</hi> And certainly in Christ's House which he hath built for his Glory, much more of his Wisdom is expected. And if God who built that old House of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Church, shewed his own Wisdom in the exact particular directions about it; surely in this New House of the New Testament, which in True Glory is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed that other, and which is built for the glory of his Wisdom, as well as the former; he hath displayed the like, or else he hath imparted the Honour to Men under the Gospel in the framing this better House, which he accounted part of his glory, and so reserved it to himself under the Old.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:154381:11"/>
                  <p> So that to Sum up this. The Apostle doth here at once, exclude both Men's hands and skill from the building of any of God's House; both because it is God's House, and themselves but part of this House. And is it not as absurd for all Men and Angels, to take on them to direct, (otherwise than by direction first given) how any of God's House should be made and built, as it were for any part of the House to give order for the rest? It is as much as for the Clay to say to the Potter, why hast thou made me thus? Is it fit for the whole House, or any part of it, to say, make me this House thus? Who shall give Christ a pattern of any House he hath promised to dwell in? Who hath been his Counsellor? Men love to have the contriving their Houses themselves, and are as curious in it to please themselves, as in any other thing, so is Christ. And the Apostle withal, expresly affirmeth on the contrary, that all things in this House, are to be built by God, for so I understand, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he that built [all these things] is God, all those things that belong to this House, which was the thing he was speaking of: So as Christ, not as a Servant as <hi>Moses</hi> was, but as being God, built this House, and all things in it, and yet according to a pattern in respect of which he is said to be faithful.</p>
                  <p>We shall annex to these Scriptures, but one reason, for the confirmation hereof, which is this; that if the Scripture hath condescended to set down a multitude of particular directions, either in examples, or in more express Rules about the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Government and Worship, whereof some are in appearance of but small importance, and might seem to be left to discretion, (as that every Man should lay aside, as God had blessed him on the first day of the week, rather than on another day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2.) That then the word hath left a full and compleat direction, as to matters of greater importance. The strength of the Consequence, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the New Testament hath given particular directions for many things, then for all of like nature, appears by this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the word of God is perfect in what ever it meddles with. If it had not medled at all with Church matters, but only given in general Rules, then indeed no compleat Pattern could have been pleaded for; but having, to our view, set out so many pieces of this Building; for any Man to say, Christ hath left other things of like nature and use unto general Rule, is to argue the Scriptures to be guilty of Imperfection, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangelist, about matters of Church Government, (which was one main part of an Evangelist's Office, and one main Argument of his Epistles to him before) says, the word of God was given to make the Man of God perfect, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Divine Wisdom of God being manifest in these Directions, in view thus giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, which Man's Wisdom in the like must not presume to imitate or come neer, if God should have given some directions, and left to Man's Wisdom other of the same kind and use, in this, man's Wisdom had been made equal to God's, in matters of this nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Those many Directions and Appointments God hath given, have a Supernatural Efficacy, and blessing in them; because they are his Institutions over and above what is in the Dictates of nature, or what reason can invent. Now if it were left to Man to add the like out of his own Wisdom, to the like uses in the Government of the Church; then Man must be supposed to have the power or promise from God, to have his Ordinances accompanied with the like Supernatural Efficacy. All God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions have for their object, Mens Souls and Consciences, so the dispens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, the Ministers; and therefore likewise the things dispensed; <hi>Obey them that rule over you, for they watch for your Souls, Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And then for their end, they are to be for the Edification of Mens Souls, and to convey the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 5, 7. And therefore are wholly Supernatural and Spiritual. And the Ministers, which are to be the means to effect those ends, should therefore not be left to the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Natural Reason, or Humane Wisdom, though never so much Elevated, as the ordering of a Family or Common-wealth is, which have for their immediate object, but Mens Bodies and Estates; and for their immediate end, but Mens natural and civil good. But if the end of Church Ordinances be Supernatural in an immediate way, then all the means should be Supernatural also in their Appointmenr and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for between the end and the means, there must be a proportion, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inabled to a spiritual effect, that hath not a Supernatural and Spiritual Original. We could not tell how to imagine or expect that God would accompany such <hi>Media</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:154381:11"/> or Means of what kind or rank so ever, as the wisdom of Man invents; with such a power. And therefore the Apostle speaking of all means Spiritual, (and by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor calling those things Weapons, which Logicians call Instruments or means) opposeth these two, 1 Cor: 10. 4. <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not Carnal,)</hi> or Humane) <hi>but mighty through God;</hi> and by that Negation insinuates, that they must be spiritual in their rise, if mighty in their working. It is as proper to the Holy Ghost to Sanctifie any thing to a spiritual end, as it is for God the Father to Create, or the Son to Redeem; and therefore for Man to appoint any thing to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual end, is as Derogatory to the Holy Ghost in his work, as the like would be to the other persons in theirs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was expresly forbidden, for Man to go about to make any thing of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention like unto God's, not Like-Oyl, not Like-Days, not Like-Posts to Gods; and therefore much more it is prohibited, that Man should frame like Institutions for the Order and Government of the Churches under the Gospel.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>What power Spiritual or Ecclesiastical is, of the Nature of a Divine Institution; How the Knowledge of Divine Institutions is derived to us, that we may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what are truly, and really such.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>POwer Spiritual is an impress of, or an investiture with the Authority of Christ, meerly out of his Will, whereby Men are Authorized and Enabled by Commission from Christ, and in his Name to do that which others cannot do; and by virtue of which, what they so do, hath a special Efficacy in it from the power of Christ, seconding and accompanying of it; which also the Conscience acknowledging Subjects it self to, as unto the power of Christ, for the sake of his Will and Institution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>An Institution is that which is meerly founded upon Gods Will, raising up a thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond its own Natural or Moral Efficacy, with an Efficacy beyond it.</hi> As for Men to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselves, is a Moral Duty; but that God should appoint, and set apart a whole day for them, to do it with Fasting, and so have a Blessing therefrom, this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the nature of the thing, and is therefore an Institution. The Trumpets in the Wars, they had a natural Efficacy to Incourage; but that the Priests should blow Trumpets when the People of <hi>Israel</hi> went to War, had a Blessing beyond the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Efficacy of the thing; therefore those persons were appointed to do it. To hear the Word, it is a Duty we owe to God, as we are Men, whomsoever he shall appoint to Preach it to us, whether he should speak it himself, or by others; but that he should appoint men rather than Angels, or rather than speak himself, that he should single out some men for that Office, and put a special Efficacy upon them, as sent by him; this is to raise up what hath a natural and common Efficacy in it, beyond the nature of the thing; and as it dependeth meerly upon his Will, so it hath a special Institution in it, because of a special Efficacy accompanying it.</p>
                  <p>Institutions are not only express Commands in the letter of them; for Examples and Promises, Hints, and Implicite intimations, may hold forth the Will of Christ. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is every thing that is the Will and Command of Christ an Institution; but it must be judged to be distinguished from other Commands by the matter of it. If any thing be taken out from the course of Nature, from the course of Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or from the common Law of Nature; and be peculiarly raised up above other things of its rank, to have a special Force and Efficacy in it; then if the Will of Christ be declared concerning such a thing, it is peculiarly an Institution, although other things be commanded, as well as it. That Bread and Wine should signifie and convey to us the Body and Blood of Christ, this is by special Institution, because it is beyond the Nature of the thing, it depends only upon God's Will; to have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen these Elements to do it, rather than others; and so they have a special Efficacy in them. But to have the Death of Christ set forth by way of Preaching, that's not an Institution simply as such: But that there should a peculiar blessing go along with the Apostles in Preaching, or with Evangelists, or with the Ministers, this depends upon Gods Will; for he might have chosen others. A Butcher or any
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154381:12"/> Man could have killed the Sacrifices, as well as the Priests, or any of the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> could have done it; but God singles out the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> separates them to this work. To give Alms to Men as Men, is the command of God, <hi>Do good unto all, Gal.</hi> 6. 10. But this is not an Institution, because founded also upon a common ground. To give Alms to Saints, is founded also upon the like ground, analogous to the other, if to Men, as Men, then especially to Saints as Saints; but to make Collections in the Church where God is Worshipped, here it becometh a Sacrifice; and then to make this Collection upon the first day of the Week, rather than upon another; this must needs be an Institution. So that oftentimes God doth take such things as are prescribed by the Law of Nature, and such things as are commanded upon other common grounds, and yet annexeth some special and peculiar Stamp of his own Will upon them, as they are done thus and thus, or by such and such. Hence is the distinction that our Divines give upon the first and second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that as there is <hi>Cultus Naturalis</hi> in them, as to fear God, and to love Him, obey Him, to hear His Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So also there is <hi>Cultus institutus,</hi> which is the substance of the second Commandment. So also there are means of Edification which are providential, and so occasionally will serve; if a Man should walk in a Churchyard, and see a death's Head, it might put him in mind of Death; but for a Man to set up a Death's Head in his Study, continually to do it; this were the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of an Institution. If a Man went forth and heard a Lark sing, in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential way, it might stir up his mind to think of God or Heaven; or if a Man hears musick, it may do the like; but to keep a Lark in Cage on purpose, that when it sings, my mind should be stirred up, or to have musick on purpose to stir up the mind in a constant setled way; this were to make it as an Institution, as in the Temple it was, when musick was there used. So as the constant setting apart of such a thing, for such an end, (though providentially and occasionally, it may serve for such an end) riseth up to an Institution also.</p>
                  <p>We come now to consider the ways, whereby Institutions are delivered unto us by Christ, or made known to us. Institutions are but the Will of Christ, declared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning such things as are exercised above the common nature of them, to a further Spiritual end. Therefore the declaring the Will of God about them, holds in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Declaration of Gods Will in other Commands. It doth differ only in the matter; that the matter of institutions are such things as are exercised above the common Nature, to some Spiritual end and Efficacy. In the delivery of these, Jesus Christ is as Faithfull as <hi>Moses</hi> was; though he hath not delivered them in the New Testament, in written Scripture, as in a Body of Laws formed up by themselves, as <hi>Moses</hi> did; with express positive Directions, by way of Command, as the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> is given. There is a double reason of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the <hi>Jews</hi> they needed much more express holdings forth of all their Laws; because they were in the infancy of the Church; Therefore God dealt with them accordingly, in giving <hi>here a line, and there a line,</hi> and it was necessary to that State. And yet even their Systeme of Laws, is in many things obscure. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cases, which the <hi>Rabbins</hi> make in the Interpretation of the Ceremonial Law, which have a great deal of Difficulty in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the chief Reason is this; because (as was hinted afore) <hi>Moses</hi> his Law, was given to a Church and Nation formed up, and that by writing from the first. But the Apostles did not so; they delivered these Rules to the Churches, by way of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. They Converted Men by Preaching, and formed up Churches, and setled Government, and Order amongst them, as well as Faith. And it was the pleasure and mind of the Holy Ghost, to leave to Posterity, those Rules which the Apostles expresly gave out to Churches, then by word of Mouth, to leave them I say to Posterity in writing, by hinting what practises were in Churches, Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Epistles,</hi> and in the <hi>Acts.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>It were a good project to add in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, how that there is no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that we stand for, but there is a Vestigiam of it left in some of those Churches, and to give Instances still all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long of all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and so, as to prove every one first by Scripture,</hi> 2. <hi>By conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy to Spiritual Reason, and</hi> 3. <hi>By the Opinion of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so</hi> 4. <hi>By the Footsteps of them in all Churches.</hi>
                     </note> So as what was delivered to them in a way of command positively, is traduced to us by way of Example, how Churches were then governed. Therefore suitably the Apostle saith, <hi>we have no such Custom, nor the Churches of God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. And those customs of the Churches, were Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and Derived down to us; and unto this Day, the <hi>Vestigia</hi> of them all hath (though with Superadditions, and Perversions) remained in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So as we have both the hints and practices of the primitive times, and also those footsteps remaining in the Churches to this Day.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:154381:12"/> 1. Now such Institutions as those, they are sometimes delivered to us in promises; and we may gather them by the promises that are made to things above their Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Efficacy. And when we find such promises, although we have it not in express Letter, you shall do thus or thus; yet to such things as we find promises made, which are above the Natural Efficacy of them, we may warrantably argue their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution: As for the Sentence the Church shall give, the promise being, <hi>whose sins you bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, Mat.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>John</hi> 20. 23. which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Efficacy of the Sentence of Men upon Earth; this evidently argueth a Church, and their Sentence to be by Institution. And so also when Christ saith, <hi>where two or three are gathered together in my Name, I will be in the midst of them, Mat.</hi> 18. 20. This implies, that the gathering together in his Name, is an Institution; for there is a special promise of his being in the midst of them: And this being spoken upon occasion of his mentioning a Church, is evidently therefore the Institution of a Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If you will make every thing a promise is made to, to be an Institution, we shall then have too many Institutions:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> We do not make every thing a promise is made to, an Institution. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are made to the People of God; but Institutions are in this case to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from all things else by the matter. However, promises are the Declaration of Gods Will, be they made to what things soever; and if they fall upon such things as are raised up above natural and common Efficacy, with promise of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural power to accompany them; then they are Institutions. If that promises be made to any Action, <hi>As to Honour thy Father and Mother, that thy Days may be long, &amp;c.</hi> then that Action is a Duty, although there were no Commandment for it; only it is not an Institution, because there is not a Supernatural Spiritual Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy put upon it. So if promises be made to the People of God, the People of God be not an Institution indeed, but it argues that they are the People of God; it doth separate them from the rest of the World. But if it falleth upon actions or things, or Persons raising them up to have a Spiritual Efficacy unto others above their Natures, then it is an Institution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These Institutions are sometimes declared by Implicite Directions; as when the Apostle saith, do not ye Judge them that are within? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. that is, <hi>Have not you power amongst you?</hi> It is but an Implicite Institution; but it holds forth, that there had been an Institution and Commission of power given them, he takes it for granted; and so the like should be amongst us. So when he saith to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> also; <hi>when ye are gathered together, deliver such an one to Satan,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3. 4, 5. making it their sin, that they did not; it implies, there was therefore a Law that had been given them, or else there had been no Transgression. Thus by the same kind of Arguing, we find a promise in Scripture, to be argued even out of a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. So Heb. 4. 5. <hi>If they shall enter into my Rest.</hi> Hence the Apostle Argues, some shall enter in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When there is a Commission of power given; there is a declared Institution. As in those words; <hi>What you bind, shall be bound, go and Teach all Nations.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is an Institution of a Church, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 18, 19, 20. For there is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission given to bind. And if Apostolical power be an Institution by virtue of that in John 20 23. <hi>Whose sins ye remit, are remitted,</hi> &amp;c. then here also by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of these words; <hi>If thy Brother offend, tell the Church: If thou wilt</hi> Circumcise thy self and thy Seed, I will bless thee; obey them that watch over your Souls, there is an Institution; for it doth not only hold, that every Christian should obey the Minister he is under; but that he should be under his Ministry, and that the Minister should watch over him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are virtual Institutions, as well as formal; for the consequence which argues Gods Will, be it in one thing, as well as in another, is as truly the Word, as in the express Letter of it. So many points of Doctrine are Demonstrated, as the Case of the Resurrection of Christ the third Day; and Jesus Christ's proof of the Resurrection, by the instance of God's being the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi> And as one Truth may be gathered out of another, so one Institution may be gathered out of another; for they are both but the Declarations of Gods Will. And if there be a necessary consequence, that if there be such an Institution, there must be likewise this, that it is Gods Will that such a thing must be, then that is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for an Institution also.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:154381:13"/>
                  <p> When therefore many things that God hath Instituted, being put altogether, do necessarily infer something else, then that also is an Institution. As if that God hath appointed Officers and Overseers, limited to a Flock by a special relation, over whom God hath made them Overseers, then that there should be a Flock, and that that Flock should have its bounds, which they have relation to, must be by Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution also. If when they are gathered together they must deliver to Satan, and they must gather together to excommunicate and deliver to Satan, and this delivering to Satan be by Institution, then their meeting also. As the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is rightly fetched out of a <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor,</hi> so if there be several particulars which put together supposeth some <hi>4th</hi> or <hi>5th</hi> thing, then God hath instituted that thing; if it be such as is not necessarily in nature, but dependeth upon the Institution of his Will. As if he hath commanded Men to assemble and meet, to tarry one for another till they meet, and that if any of them sin they should cast them out, and that their power reacheth to them that are within, this necessarily implies that this company thus meeting are a Church by Institution in relation unto such meetings. If a King did write to a Town to do all such things as an incorporate Town useth to do, if such and such offences fall out amongst them to judge them that are within; would not this be evidently a charter to them, to make them an incorporate Town? As Lords are made Lords being called up by a Writ, so here. Therefore all such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections as we find in the Epistles, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. to do thus and thus, implies them to be incorporate bodies, which Incorporation depends as much upon God's Will as the acts themselves, which they are to do being so incorporated, do.</p>
                  <p>And perhaps the Synagogues under the Old Testament, though we do not read when they were instituted by express Command or Law, as for making of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the like there is, yet was derived out of the general Charter, for their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Temple, and every seventh year to read the Word, as less Leases are by parcels made out of a greater Lease. And so they were by Institution consequentially.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Institutions are made known by Prophecies in the Old Testament, concerning the times of the Gospel. As, that upon every Assembly there should be a Cloud; that the day of Christ's Resurrection should be the Christian Sabbath, <hi>This is the day that the Lord hath made,</hi> Psal. 118. 24. or appointed, by Prophesie, he had said to day if you will hear his Voice, in another Psalm, and if not, that they should not enter into his rest, and this in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. is by the Apostle made an Institution of; He hath appointed, saith the Apostle, another day, in opposition to the seventh day which he had spoken of in the <hi>5th</hi> and <hi>6th</hi> verses. So <hi>Clement</hi> answerably in his Epistle speaking of the Institution of the Offices of Bishops and Deacons, quoteth the Prophesie in <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. 17. out of the Septuagint, as then it was, neither saith he, is this a new institution, but many years afore it was thus written of Bishops and Deacons. <note n="*" place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Clem. Epist. ad Corinth.</hi> p. 55. <hi>Edit. Patr. Junii. Oxon.</hi> 1633.</note> So also in the applying of Types, we may discover what is an Institution of God, but then we must find them so applied, if we find them warrantably applied by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament, or by Prophecy in the Old (for the signification of a Type it is by the Holy Ghost as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 8. the Holy Ghost thus signifying) we may infer an Institution from them. So when it is said in <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 21. <hi>I will take of them for Priests and for Levites,</hi> it implies that there should be these two ranks and sorts of Officers in the New Testament, answerable to those two in the Old, for ordinary Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as indeed there are, <hi>viz.</hi> Bishops and Deacons.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We may be assured what is of Divine Institution by parallel reason, between things of a kind, and of a like nature; as for example, God having appointed Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism a Sacrament, and the Lord's Supper a Sacrament, these being things of a kind, if he hath bidden and appointed Ministers by Institution to Baptise, the reason is good that therefore they should have power to administer the Lord's Supper, although there is no instance in Scripture for it. So if he have given them power to be the Mouth of God in Preaching to the People, then also that they should be the Mouth of the People to God in Prayer, we finding that publick Prayer is appointed as well as Preaching, although we have not one instance in the New Testament that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Church did perform publick Prayer. So also God hath appointed Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and he hath appointed Elders, he hath appointed Deacons to be set up by choice, and the Elders to be set up by choice; we find that the People did chuse their Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, we warrantably argue▪ therefore they may chuse their Elders. In things that are thus of a like reason, we argue from one to the other in other cases, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:154381:13"/> (since to us Christians 'tis not the Judicial, and Ceremonial, but the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law which is obligatory) how do we know, and why do we take the Levitical Law for degrees prohibited in Marriage, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. Because we find in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. one of those degrees forbidden in the New Testament, <hi>viz.</hi> for one to have his Father's Wife, and therefore all the rest, although we have no warrant in Scripture for every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular degree. Also in that Law the Letter of it only forbiddeth the Aunt to Marry the Nephew, the Popish Divines have argued, that, yet it is lawful for the Uncle to Marry the Neece; whereas on the contrary, by a parity of reason it is unlawful, for it is all of a like kind, as the same way from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> that is from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Thebes,</hi> the one therefore being forbidden to Marry, because they are nigh a kin, since the other is of as nigh a kin, therefore the Law holds in the one as well as in the other. So under the New Testament, we have days of fasting set apart as well as in the Old, for the same Moral grounds, but we have no one instance of a Day of Thanksgiving in the New Testament; but these being parallel Ordinances (for as Thanksgiving and Humbling of a Man's self before God for Sin are parallel duties; so to have a Day of Thanksgiving, and a Day of Fasting are parallel Ordinances) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since we find the one in the New Testament, and find both in the Old; we may argue the other from this one. But then that we may argue rightly, the things must be collateral, and of a kind, as the the Lord's Supper and Baptism are both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; Elders and Deacons are, both Officers of the Church, they are things Co-ordinate, <hi>Ejusdem ordinis,</hi> and so we may argue from one to the other, in things that may be supposed common to both, and is not upon a peculiar reason restrained to one. But otherwise for things that are subordinate as we may call them, and of another kind, there <hi>Par ratio</hi> will not make an Institution, for then it is not <hi>Par ratio,</hi> because it is not <hi>Inter paria</hi> or things co-ordinate. As we can by no means infer that, because God hath set up an office of Elders superiour to that of Deacons, because he hath set up the Office of Pastors and Teachers superiour to that of Ruling Elders, that therefore upon a pretended necessity, we may set up an office over all these El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as the Antient Times did a Bishop. And so neither will it follow, that because God hath set up a Court in a particular Church to correct offending Brethren, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering up to Satan, that therefore they may set up an higher Court in like manner to correct Churches by Excommunicating them. These are not things of the same order, but they are things of Superiority and Inferiority. Though we may argue in the Judicial Law, that if the Aunt may not Marry the Nephew, likewise the Uncle may not Marry the Neece, because they are things of the same Order, yet we must not now go and make a new Degree forbidden; as is the case betwixt our Brethren and us in the Presbyterian controversie. Reason will help us to apply the same things, in things collateral, but not to institute, and set up things anew.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the use of Man's Reason in this point about Institutions, we only say this, that Man's Reason may by way of Interpretation find out what God hath set up, but it cannot proceed further. Men mistake in thinking that if God hath set up this, that therefore they may by like reason set up another thing: As because that God hath made Set Forms of Prayer, that therefore Men may; or as because that God did deliver the Scriptures to be read, therefore Men may appoint Sermons to be read. For in so doing Man's Reason becometh a Judge, and takes on him God's Authority, in Inventing and Authorizing this, as God hath done another thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we should be content with God's means that he hath appointed; but in the other, Man's Reason is only but as a Witness, that applies a thing according to what by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he gathers God's Mind to be. And there is this difference between Doctrinal Truths and Institutions, that one Truth may be by reason better fetched out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and more safely and easily than Institutions. For one Truth begets another, and Truth is infinite in the consequences of it, but so Institutions are not. And the reason of the difference is this, because they depend upon a Promise, and upon the Power, and Will of God, immediately to concur with them, and set them up: They are things that are singled out by the Will of God, to a Spiritual End, with a Spiritual Efficacy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We may be assured what is an Institution of God, by Examples which we meet with in the Scriptures. For one way by which Christ was pleased to convey his Institutions to us, is by way of Examples in the New Testament, without the which, being intended as a rule for us, we acknowledge, that a compleat Rule for all
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:154381:14"/> things could not be made forth. We shall therefore endeavour to give reason and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, that the example of the practices of the Primitive Churches are to be taken as Rules to us. 'Tis true indeed, Examples then bind not, when the Story is so Written as there may be a supposition of errour in the example, as the Story of the Lives of the Patriarch's is; And also those examples bind not which we find expresly contradicted by a Law, or which we find blamed, as that of <hi>Peter</hi>'s dissembling, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11: and that of <hi>John</hi>'s Worshipping the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10. These are not rules. But if an example be written as a Rule, then it will bind, because there is no supposition of errour. But the Apostle's ways in Churches and ordering of them, yea and of the Churches erected by them, are propounded and professed to be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as patterns and rules to us. Neither needs there a particular warrant to make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one a rule whilst the general one that propounds all to be such will sanctifie all. I shall first prove my assertion, and then shew the reasonableness of it, that it should be so.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. My first proof is from comparing the Commission Christ gave his Apostles at his ascending, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. with the Book of the Acts, the Title and Preface to it, and Matter in it. In <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. This is the Commission he gave to his Apostles considered as common persons, as the last clause argues, <hi>Lo I am with you to the end of the World.</hi> His Commission is, that they should teach those that were Converted to observe whatever he had commanded them. For the matter of the Doctrine of the Gospel, what they should Preach, he had given Commission for that, in the verse afore, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Go teach all Nations,</hi> which <hi>Mark</hi> Interprets, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Go Preach the Gospel to every Creature▪</hi> that is, as to matters of Faith what they are to Believe, for it follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>He that believes shall be saved,</hi> But for matter of Evangelical practices what Christians are to do, and to observe by special command from Christ, that injunction he gives in a distinction from the other, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. he speaks of matters of practice as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>observe</hi> implies. And their Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is precisely limited unto what Christ had commanded; he gives them no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to impose and cause them to observe any other thing in practice but what he commanded; they went beyond their Commission if they did. For matters of practice and observancy, Apostles are to meddle with nothing else but Christ's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; And they are enjoyned to teach Men, to observe all that Christ commanded. Now the story of the Acts relating what was observed and practised by the Churches founded by the Apostles, and so in the Epistles, they giving many hints what were the Observations and Orders of Churches: We finding these and gathering them into a Body together, cannot look otherwise upon them, than as practices taught them by the Apostles, and if so, then no other than what Christ commanded. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of Churches recorded, not blamed, we take to be directions from the Apostles and to that end Written; and directions of the Apostles, we may safely take to be Commands of Christ, as well in matters to be done, as to be believed. This gives us a general ground to argue from examples of the Apostolical Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But secondly when we find the Book of the Acts to contain many practices in and about Churches, and the Officers of them recorded but by way of story, and hints of examples to shew us what was the order of Churches in the Apostle's times: We may be well assured that these were written on purpose to shew what the Apostle's taught them from Christ to observe; which we gather from all these things laid together.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the professed Title of the Book of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which, as those Titles to the <hi>Psalms,</hi> hath ever been acknowledged part of Canonical Scripture. It is entitled <hi>The Acts,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Practices</hi> of the Apostles. That Book contains much of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and yet it is not entitled <hi>The Doctrine of the Apostles,</hi> but their <hi>Practices.</hi> And it contains mostly the story of one Apostle, <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet because his ordering and setling Churches (as we shall anon observe) was by the same rule that the other Apostles all went by, it is called <hi>The Acts of the Apostles,</hi> on purpose to consign and give warrant unto those Practices as Apostolical. Yea also though many things are the practices in Churches themselves, and of the Elders and Brethren of them, yet they are called <hi>The Acts of the Apostles,</hi> because even those practices of Churches were guided by the Apostles, and so they are called their Acts; and they taught them but to observe what Christ commanded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then secondly, after <hi>Luke</hi> had given it this Title, see further what his Preface
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:154381:14"/> is, which further declares this to have been the scope and drift of it. He connects it with the Story of Christ in the Gospel, as passing from all that <hi>Jesus began both to do and teach,</hi> ver. 1. from his Example and Doctrine, unto what the Apostles did do, and what they did teach Churches to observe by commandment from Christ; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he makes mention of the Commands that Christ by the Spirit had given them unto the day he was taken up, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. All which Commandments, and those especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which pertained to his Kingdom and Government of his Church on Earth▪ he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed after his Resurrection, speaking, says he, by the space of forty days of the things of the Kingdom of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. The meaning of which both Title and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and connecting it with the story of the Evangelists is evidently this, that these Apostles being thus thoroughly furnished with Commands from Christ, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the things of his Kingdom, in governing his Saints (all which when as he was about to ascend he gave in charge, as the Evangelist <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us) that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they should teach those whom they converted to observe them, and that done you have the story, declaring the practises of the Churches they reared, and the ways of the Apostles in them, and both as such as were according to these Commands of Christ given them, which he therefore mentions in the Preface to give a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to them as rules. And the Language of it is as if he had said, you shall know what those special Commands pertaining to the Kingdom of God, and which they taught the Churches to observe, were by their ways and practices here record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and mentioned as practised in the first Churches. What Reader observing that charge in <hi>Matthew,</hi> given by Christ at his Ascension; with the Title of, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to this Book, of the <hi>Acts,</hi> but will acknowledge all the story of all the practices here recorded to be Scripture, written for our admonition, and think this to be the scope and intent of them? So that although we have not a particular warrant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to every example here to make it a rule, yet we have this general, which if it make out this, that they are written to let us see the Commandments of Christ in the Apostle's practices, it is enough.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then add to this thirdly, That the practices here recorded of the Apostles in the first Churches of <hi>Judea,</hi> were setled generally in other Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> also, who yet varied in Language, in Fashion, and Manners, and Government Civil. They ordain Deacons in the Church of <hi>Hierusalem, Acts</hi> 6. and Elders we read men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 30. which are mentioned but historically, and yet we read of the same kind of Officers, Deacons and Elders, in other Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> at <hi>Philippi, Phil.</hi> 1. 1. and in many other Churches mentioned in the <hi>Acts.</hi> Yea and we find the same Practices and Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> setled by <hi>Paul,</hi> that was Converted and made an Apostle many years after the other, and who learned not the Gospel, nor any part of it from the Apostles or the Churches of <hi>Judea,</hi> but had it by revelation of Jesus Christ, as himself says, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conferred not with flesh and blood,</hi> that is, with no man, yea <hi>I came not to Hierusalem</hi> (says he) to <hi>them which were Apostles afore me,</hi> ver. 17. <hi>but I went into Arabia, ond returned again into Damascus; and then after three years I came again un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hierusalem to visit Peter,</hi> ver. 18. <hi>and none Apostles saw I save James,</hi> ver. 19. And yet he set up the same practices in Churches that the other Apostles did, <hi>Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Elders in every City, and Deacons,</hi> &amp;c. Now that they should so agree in the same practices; that these all here recorded should be intitled the practices of the Apostles; that they should be the same in several Churches, in that first of <hi>Judea,</hi> and the same from several Apostles in those several Churches, and some of these Apostles not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting each with other; how could this be but as guided by the same Spirit, and as going by the same rule common to all, which was the Commands of Christ?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yea fourthly, As they have thus Christ's Commands (afore the recording these practices) for their warrant, so some of them that are recorded in the <hi>Acts</hi> but as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storically done at the first as Acts of the Apostles, yet are in after-times in other Scriptures, given by way of command. Now this further confirms this same, being thus warranted and consigned, for the rest to shew the like reason of all the other. Thus the first mention of the Office of Deacons in the Church, is but historically and by way of example set down with the occasion of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. As also of Bishops and Elders in the Acts often, and not at all as recorded therein with any commands from the Apostles, and yet to shew that these examples are recorded for Commands and Rules, <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> writing to him how to behave himself in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:154381:15"/> the house of God, mentions these Offices of Deacons and Elders as the Commands of Christ, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and on the contrary, that which Christ gave a Precept and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution about, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. namely Church Censure and Excommunication, you have it in a directive example given to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And for a Fifth Argument yet further to confirm this, the Apostles do in their Epistles refer Churches and Others to their Example in the Churches, as Rules for their Imitation, and this in matters of Church Order. Thus in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Paul</hi> when he was to Write to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> about ordering matters of Order, as <hi>ver.</hi> 34. shews, and also all the particulars in that chapter do shew it (for they are matters of that nature, as about covering and uncovering, in token of Subjection, and about their Love Feasts breeding Divisions, and Eating in the Assemblies, and the abuse in the Lord's Supper, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> he makes this the Preface to all these, <hi>Be ye followers of me even as I am of Christ,</hi> ver. 1. commending them in other things of their Church Order (such as these) they had remembred all these things, and kept the Ordinances as he had delivered them, so <hi>ver.</hi> 2. But in these abuses and disorders, he saith he could not but dispraise them, <hi>ver.</hi> 17: Now in all matters of this Nature, as well as matters of Doctrine, he exhorts them to be Followers of his example, and practice in the Churches as he was in Christ: So as about all, for such things Christ gave a command and the Apostles gave order, and by their Doctrine and Practices delivered them. We have no such custom says he, that is, no such practice, and so condemns their disorder, by bringing them to that as the Rule. So also in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to that Discourse of his about Church Censures to be executed upon that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous Member in the Church, which you read of, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. and other particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that follow in that Epistle, he tells them <hi>chap.</hi> 4, that though they may have many thousand Instructers, yet he was their Father, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Telling them, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. that he had sent <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangelist unto them, which should put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Ways in Christ, as I Teach every where in every Church, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof is plainly this, that he did bind them to no other Rule than what he bound all other Churches to; and that his example or way, whereof <hi>Timothy</hi> could put them in mind, was that Rule he would have them and other Churches follow, he teaching all Churches to follow those his ways, for otherwise <hi>Timothy</hi> could not know what he taught every where in every Church, so as he means not his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine materially, but his ways which he taught every Church to follow as also he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth them. So in his Writing to the Church of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> his general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion in matters of Practice is, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Those things which you have both learned and received, and heard, and seen in me, do,</hi> what you have received by hearing and learned by seeing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I observe, his ways and practices in all the Churches were regular and alike in, and all tyed to the same rule, and given by Doctrine and by Example also. Look what his ways were, the same he taught, and this universally in all Churches, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to observe it as Christ charged them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He means his Ways in matters of Discipline and Government of the Church as well as Doctrine, and indeed those matters of Discipline were delivered also by Doctrine to those Churches. For 1. This is a Preface to his Discourse about matters of Discipline, which he enters into, in the following verses and following chapters. 2. Therefore he calleth them <hi>Ways</hi> not <hi>Way,</hi> as being acts and practices of him as an Apostle, things to be done, which matters of Faith are not called. And 3. They were not moral ways of the moral law, for these the Old Testament directed to, and he might refer them unto the Rules there, but Evangelical ways he means, which the Gospel brought in, <hi>Ways in Christ,</hi> given as directions in all Churches. And 4 To that end he sent <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangelist, whose Office it was to order things in Church Government, as appears by the matter of the Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus.</hi> Add but this, that if any where he calls on them to imitate him in Discipline, then in these places, matters of Discipline are meant and included, but he doth this in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. and the matters of this first Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are much about order, <hi>The rest will I order when I come,</hi> 1 Cor, 11. 34. and so <hi>Timothy</hi> was sent to establish them therein.</p>
                  <p>Again 3. Writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> an Evangelist on purpose to direct him how to behave himself in the House of God (this being the chief scope of those Epistles as was noted) he calls him to his example as his rule, as one that had known his Doctrine,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:154381:15"/> Manners, Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 Tit. 3. 10. <hi>But thou hast fully known my Doctrine, manner of Life, Purpose, Faith, Long-fuffering, Charity, Patience.</hi> The word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Juxta sequi, vestigiis insistere,</hi> hast followed it step by step. 1. In Doctrine, 2. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, in Converse or ways in the Churches, as that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. shews in my Platform, or Form, or Leading, or Method, which may very well mean his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Churches, his leading or framing them, and training them up.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yea, 4. Yet further, to shew that the practices of Churches setled by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, are Rules unto us; we find him calling upon Churches, then to imitate the Orders of other Churches in those times planted by the Apostles, therefore the practices of Churches Recorded and not blamed, are intended as Rules. The Customs of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es is now much urged in the World, to bind others to them, because the Apostles refer'd to them; but the Argument fails and differs in this, which is not considered, that the Custom of Churches then were Apostolical; and such Customs in such Churches, so directed infallibly, and Recorded then when the Apostles were present, we may safely account Obligatory, but not Customs meerly Humane. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> Argues from the Custom of all Churches, in that 1 Cor. 10. 16. <hi>We have no such Custom, nor the Churches of the Saints,</hi> that is, thus founded by Apostles. Thus, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 14. he commends them for having become Followers of the Churches of God in <hi>Judea,</hi> because they being the first Churches planted by the Apostles, were almost exact according to the pattern. Of other Churches he says, <hi>Came the Word of God out from you?</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 36. Now from the Churches of <hi>Judea</hi> it did. And he speaks it generally of all their imitations of them; and that both in matters of Order as well as Faith, they being Constituted and setled in both; for if not in all things, why puts he not the difference?</p>
                  <p>And to shew that all Churches in such matters, were ordered by the same Rule, one as well as another; and that therefore what we find Recorded of one Church▪ was in like manner in all, the Apostle sometimes in giving Cirections to one Church, adds, <hi>As I Ordain in other Churches of Christ also.</hi> Thus 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. in the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Collections on the first Day of the Week, which is in view but an inferiour Matter, and might have been done any day, yet when he gives instruction about it to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though it had been enough, that he an Apostle gave it, yet he puts this in, <hi>as I Ordain in the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>so do ye also.</hi> So in giving those Rules about Prophecying, to speak one by one, and the lesser number of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, to submit to the greater, he inforceth it by this, in 1 Cor. 14. 33. <hi>as we see in all the Churches of the Saints;</hi> and ver. 37. <hi>let him that is Spiritual, acknowledge that these are the Commands of God.</hi> To this doth that old saying agree, <hi>Constabit id esse ab Apostolis traditum quod Ecclesiis, Apostorum fuit sacro sanctum.</hi> That is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to have been delivered by the Apostles, which hath been Sacredly observ'd by the Churches of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Christ calls upon the same Churches, to imitate the first Pattern given them, and wherein they or any swerved, he Reduceth them to what they had at first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and learned from the Apostles, as containing an immutable Rule, not to be swerved from. Now if they had not liberty to swerve from them, then not we, Rev. 3. 3. <hi>Remember how thou hast received and heard, and hold fast and Repent.</hi> Those Epistles to the Seven Churches, do as much concern Discipline, as matters of Doctrine; for the chief fault he doth find with them, still is flackness of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, whereby they suffered Men to Teach or Practice amiss.</p>
                  <p>Now the general Reason of this, why the Apostle left these things in Example, is first; because this agrees with the Nature of the thing, for matters of Practice and Order, are as well, if not better Represented in Examples than Rules, Men are moved more by Examples, than by Precepts, (as <hi>Seneca</hi> said) as Buildings and their Platform are best set out in Pictures. And 2. Consider the manner of writing Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the occasion of writing these of the New Testament, both <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Epistles,</hi> and it will appear that this way of Example was most suitable. 1. The manner of the Scriptures, even as to matters of Doctrine, is not to write Methods or Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Truths ordered, but scattered; and often left to us to pick them out, by Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and Coherences, and this as to many great Truths. And 2. Let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der when it was they were written? The Work was not first to write Scriptures, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Churches Constituted to their Hands. Though <hi>Moses</hi>'s case was otherwise, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154381:16"/> had a People already gathered, the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were in one place, whom he could therefore deliver a Law unto, in Precepts, yet the Apostles Disperst themselves to several places; and their first Work was to Convert Men in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and so to build them up into Churches, and so carry their Directions with them in their Breasts. Thus they did first in <hi>Judea,</hi> then among the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and every one of them, (when apart) was led with an infallible Spirit in so doing, and all with one Spirit, agreeing and conspiring in the same, as by the Churches set up by them doth appear. And many years after this, were the Scriptures written to those Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, (as occasion was) whom they had first Ordered and Disciplined; and this for the direction of times to come: And so in writing to them, they hint Relations of what was done and constituted among them Histiorcally, (for the Rule was already put in practice, and they were framed and reared:) And so <hi>Luke</hi> writes an Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Relation, (after the Apostles had set many Churches) of their Acts and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and it was not comely to write a Law to such Churches, to have such and such Officers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when already they had them; but rather they maintain their Officers, as existing among them already, and shew their Diversity, by Exhorting them to their several Duties, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. and elsewhere; which yet because they were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Apostolical direction, is hint enough to us to have the like. If they had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to any company in a place that had not been gathered into Church Fellowship, to, <hi>Ecclesia constituenda,</hi> A Church that was to be Constituted, then it had been meet to have written the Laws and Rules of it, how to order themselves. But the Apostles had already afore, writing the Scripture, cast all Churches into that Order which Christ had appointed, and by Example and Precept, in word of Mouth deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered them, the <hi>Traditions</hi> as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. And after upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, writing to some of them as Churches already Constituted, he mentioneth mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Discipline, but either Historically, as already setled among them, or by way of Precept in such particulars as they were amiss in; yet so as Divine Providence, that took care for after times, hath given a Compleat Direction, either in Hints and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of those Examples, of what was already Constituted in some Churches, or in such those Occasional Precepts.</p>
                  <p>And further in general, that Examples, Recorded in Scripture,, are intended as Rules, and so are understood by Divines, appears by these Instances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is evident in the matter of the Sabbath; for which, suppose that we have no positive command given in the New Testament (and the command in the Old, was evidently pitcht on the seventh Day from the Creation, in the Letter of the command) yet because we have mention of it by way of practice, and Administration of Holy meetings on that day; as in that of Collection of Saints, upon the first day of the Week; and <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. of breaking Bread on the first day of the Week, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> our Divines have warrantably concluded the alteration of it. And therefore we do alike wonder at those that are for Church ways, that they should be against the Lord's day; and that those that are for the Sabbath, should be against the form of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the New Testament.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is evident also, in matters of contract afore Marriage; but a hint by the by, in a Rule given concerning Adultery, and in the Example of <hi>Joseph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> confirms the obligation of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The same appears in many particular explications of the Moral Law. All that write upon the Commandments, though for greater things of the Law, these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the express Rules; yet the lesser explications are but from examples of Holy Men. Now allow but the same liberty in these Evangelical Precepts; that for the great things, there are express Precepts for; as for the Sacraments, for Institution of Churches, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. for Officers in <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. for Censures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. but for many Branches; for matter of carriage in these, we must have them out of the examples and hints in the New Testament, and it is all that we ask.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We find our Saviour Christ and the Apostles, arguing from examples of first Patterns. Thus, 1. To prove what is lawful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 3. Christ argues from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi> example, in breaking a Law, in eating when he was Hungry the shew-bread (which was not otherwise lawful for him to eat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 33.) To prove it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to pull Ears of Corn on the Sabbath Day, and eat them. And so from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Priests profaning the Sabbath, and being <hi>blameless, Matth.</hi> 12. 5. that is, not found fault with: And though Christ annexeth a ground out of one of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154381:16"/> Prophets, I <hi>will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice;</hi> yet consider that that Law came long after, and these examples were in force long before this Law; for <hi>Hosea</hi> wrote long after. 2. Examples are urged, not only to prove what is lawful, but also what is a Duty. Thus the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. Exhorts Wives, that their <hi>Adorning should not be that of putting on Apparell, but the Ornament of a meek Spirit,;</hi> for v. 5. <hi>after this manner in the Old Time, the Holy Women who Trusted in God, Adorned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</hi> Thus also in the matter of Praying twice a Day, Morning and Evening, says <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 3. <hi>Whom I serve from my Forefathers without ceasing, having them in remembrance in my Prayers, Day and Night.</hi> This custom to pray so often, was from the Fore-fathers, who in the Temple did so, and in their Houses; and this is argued not so much from an express command, as from their examples. 3. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the first Institution is founded upon an example, then the example is the Great Argument for it; <hi>As Primum in quolibet genere est mensura reliquorum,</hi> the first in every kind is the measure of the rest, so in this case too. Thus the Law of Marriage is founded upon the example of <hi>Adam's</hi> Marriage, and so argued from both, by the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> and by Christ also; both that a Man should have but one Wife, and not put her away. Thus <hi>Malachi</hi> argues from the very Creation, of but one Woman for <hi>Adam,</hi> as a rule for us, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 15. and did he not make one? And wherefore one? Yet had he a Residue of Spirit, (namely to have made more) <hi>that he might have a lawfull and godly Seed;</hi> for which cause, Adultery and unlawful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, is not Sanctified from the first Institution. And so our Saviour Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 4, 8. <hi>In the beginning it was not so,</hi> argues from the practice then.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that there was a Law; <hi>Therefore shall a Man leave his Father and his Mother,</hi> &amp;c. Yet still the Law is founded upon the example of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> the first Pattern; that because God made but two at first, therefore no more should be joyned together, as Christ reasoneth, Matth. 19. 4. <hi>Have ye not read, that he that made them one at the first, made them Male and Female?</hi> He argues from that very instance. Yea, and he made the first Woman of <hi>Adam's</hi> Flesh, so as <hi>Adam</hi> said, she is Bone of my Bone, and Flesh of my Flesh; and therefore, or for this cause (as Christ and the Apostle Interprets it) was the Law given; yet so as <hi>Adam's</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is made the Foundation of it; because <hi>Primum in isto genere,</hi> what <hi>Adam</hi> did then by God's appointment, is a Rule for ever.</p>
                  <p>Only to prevent a mistake, we will add these Cautions as Limitations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That for the great and more Essential parts of Church Order and Worship, we have express and direct Rules. As for the Institution and Constitution of a Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. For the Administration of Censures by Admonition, Excommunication, for the chief Officers thereof; Bishops and Deacons, for the Sacraments, publick Prayers, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Examples do only mostly concern the Limits, Order, and Administration of all these. And in such things, Scripture Examples should be admitted for Rules; for so it is in Interpreting the Moral Law. The great things of each Commandment, concern the grosser sins, and mainest general Duties for which you have express Rules and Commands; but for all the particular Branches and Cases about particular Sins and Duties, it will be hard to fetch express Rules to direct Men's Consciences; but Men take the help and benefit of examples unblamed in Scripture, for a Decision of them. Look all Interpreters of the Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their Quotations, and you will find it so. Now why should not as great a liberty be left us to find out God's politicks, as God's Ethicks, it being as necessary, if not more, that Men should have directions to guide their converse in the House of, God, as in their own Houses and private Affairs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We must be carefull that we take such Examples, as are written and not blamed, supposing this to be the Rule, that what is not blamed or contradicted by a Rule doth bind us. Christ arguing from an Example of the Priests, alledgeth that for a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, you read (saith he) <hi>how that the Priests profaned the Sabbath, and are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> Matth. 12. 5. Hence because Apostolical Examples in the converse in Churches are Recorded as Rules; therefore such Examples of theirs as were faulty are blamed, and took notice of, as <hi>Peter's</hi> Example in a Church matter at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Gal. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved him to his Face, and that upon this ground, because his Example being an Apostle, <hi>Compelled Men,</hi> Gal. 2. 14. it had the force of an Argument in it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We must get Characters to distinguish between Extraordinary, and Ordinary Examples, Recorded of Churches and the Apostles. As we do make a Distinction
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154381:17"/> of Christ's own Example; and of <hi>Philip's</hi> Baptizing out of a Church, (he being an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and carrying Church power about with him, and the Person's Case requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring present departure into a far Country) and of Christians selling their Estates in the first Churches of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when there were many poor; and of the Apostles being maintained, and sent into all the World.</p>
                  <p>If you ask how we shall Distinguish them? We Answer, even as you do other things that are Extraordinary, promiscuously Recorded with Ordinary, for the things Distinguish themselves; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. speaking of Gifts, he promiscuoufly reckons up Ordinary and Extraordinary, <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>To one is given a word of Wisdom, to another a word of Knowledge, to another the gifts of Healing, and to another working of Miracles, to another divers Tongues,</hi> here is no greater matter of Distinction put for the things, than what themselves afford. The Gifts that remain still in the Church, are Ordinary, they that do not are Extraordinary. So for Officers, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>God hath set in the Church, First, Apostles, Secondarily, Prophets, Thirdly, Teachers, after that Miracles, then helps in Government.</hi> How can we distinguish here, and know that we have Teachers and Government, and not Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by this, that the necessity of Gifts for Teaching and Government still remains, not the other? And so do we as easily distinguish of Examples, such as were things common, founded upon common and general Respects, these we account Ordinary, and to bind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they may continue, and the reason of them continue, where it is not so in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The like we say of Examples meerly occasional. The occasion ceasing the thing ceaseth: And therein we judge but as we do of other things under the Law, when yet <hi>Moses</hi> gave direct Rules; as in eating the Passover, that they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do it with staves in their Hands, and in hast was meerly suited to the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the first Passover, because that Night they were to Travell, and so it did not bind afterward.</p>
                  <p>If you say, shew me a compleat Systeme of Directions out of the Examples or Rules given, and we will believe you.</p>
                  <p>To this we Answer. 1. That in the main and substantial matters, we can shew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to guide the present practices of Churches, in managing the great and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Ordinances of Christ. We gave one Instance afore for all the rest, about dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Censures of the Church. And 2. By finding express order taken about small things, (as to Carnal Eyes they may seem to be) we may be directed in greater as how and when to order the Collection for the Saints, on the first day of the week, and to Treasure up by a Man's self weekly, as God hath blessed him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as another Set Day in the Week might have served, according to Humane Prudence as well, and to lay up as God hath blest a Man, at the Months end, might seem to have been as well in a way of Humane Arbitrary Prudence, and have been left to Men's Directions) and yet the Apostle makes this an Order in <hi>Corinth,</hi> and in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Galatia.</hi> Now think we, if God took care and bound up Humane Wisdom, and Interposed his own in matters of such small Moment, as these Circumstances seem to be; we cannot but believe he hath done the like in all things else of a like Nature; and either he would have given Rules about such things, or have left a compleat Rule, if we could find it out. That in Digging, we find such small Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals as these, here and there, stamped by God's Authority, and bearing the Image of his Wisdom and Soverainty, doth encourage us to Dig, hoping to find that whole Treasure that is hid in Christ, in whom we are compleat, for all Treasures of Knowledge and Wisdom. And this binds up our understandings from daring to Coyn by Humane Wisdom and Authority, and the like Institutions, lest we should set up our posts by God's, and eat out by Humane Prudence, those things which we see God hath used his Wisdom to deliver to us, (as by such Instances evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears) wherein we ought to suspect our Ignorance of his Will, rather than his Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to deliver all of the like Nature. And <hi>3ly</hi> We are to be carefull in doing what we find a Rule and Examples for, and so whereunto we have Attained, walking. We find that True of Christ, and made good by him unto us, that in doing the Will of God, we know it; and in matters of practice Experience, with Faith waiting for Light, helps to the Knowledge, more than all the Study in the Abstract in the World can do. And therefore though we profess, we know not Rules for every Case, or Query that may be put, yet so far as we have Attained, we walk; suspending
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:154381:17"/> where we want light till God reveal it, knowing that God will accept this: We find<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing that in all sorts of humane actions, in all callings and relations there are a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand cases, wherein men are to seek for direction out of the Word, and yet they do not forbear to walk in all those relations, till they are resolved of every particular case and duty that may fall out. And so in matters of Doctrine, if we should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to believe the truths we know and have received, until we have a compleat Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem of undoubted verity, and <hi>Paul</hi>'s form of wholesome words in all particulars we should be ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of, and assent to any truth.</p>
                  <p>And therefore our desires is, that the Churches of Christ would in this Age (wherein these things are enquired into, and the Reformation of Discipline yet imperfect) walk by this rule, that so far as they agree, and in common have found out the rule, to walk by it, and be obliged so to do, and wherein they differ or want that light that others have, they might be left to that rule which God hath set up, as the great Peace-maker and Arbiter in his Churches, not to judge one another for these things, but to say with the Apostle, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se that are otherwise minded God shall reveal it to them in his due time,</hi> and in so doing know God will accept us, and we hope men will.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That there are Ordinances of Publick Worship established in Churches under the New Testament, which are to continue to the End of the World.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Design not to discourse here of the Doctrine of Ordinances, as it is stated against the Seekers, who yield the Being of such Ordinances to be of Divine Right, and no deficiency to be in Christ's Institution; and yet assert that as a rose in Winter hath a Being in the World, of right, as well as any other Fruit of the Earth then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; only there is not a way of means of its actual existence by reason of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, so Ordinances have a Right of being in the Church, but Anti-Christ, hath Withered all things, and made an interruption in Ordinances, Ministry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Generation of men have risen up, who cry down all Ordinances as Forms, yea and would rank them as Forms equally, with all the Idolatries in Popery, or any other Superstitions, in all which (say they) God was in those appearances served, as well as in those that were once of his own Institution; so making them all one and all forms alike, they pretend to live in the Spirit, and not only without all these, but above them. But besides what the Prophecy of <hi>Jude</hi> and other holy Apostles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> have given in caution concerning these, <hi>Jude</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21, ver. <hi>How that they told you, there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e be they which separate themselves, sensual, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the spirit. But ye beloved, building up your selves on your more holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep your selves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</hi> The separation there is to be interpreted by what as the opposite thereto the Apostle exhorts true Believers unto. <hi>But you beloved building up your selves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. What he mentioneth as means of Grace to preserve them to eternal life; from these it was these men separated, pretending to live in Spirit, and therefore with Indignation the holy Apostle saith of them, that they were <hi>Sensual not having the Spirit.</hi> They separated not from other Christians, but from these things, that were means of Grace when influenced by the Spirit. I will not meddle with any of their Evasions, but only positively speak that which concerns the truth of my position, and prove the existency, and continuance of Gospel Ordinances, as Baptism, the Lord's Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I will begin with that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon which I have discoursed on another occasion, namely, to shew the danger of living in the practice of prevailing Lusts, under Ordinances. That which now I shall make use of that Scripture for, is to shew both the existence and continuance of Ordinances, of Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, under the New Testament.</p>
                  <p>1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Moreover Brethren, I would nor that ye should be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, how that all our Fathers were under the Cloud, and all passed through the Sea,</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:154381:18"/>
                     <hi>and did all Eat the same Spiritual Meat, and did all Drink ihe same Spiritual Drink, (for they Drank of that Spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ) But with many of them God was not well pleased: For they were overthrown in the Wilderness. Now these things were our Examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</hi> Compare it with <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The general scope is, to shew how for the substance of them, the Fathers enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the same Spiritual Ordinances, which now our Baptism and the Lord's Supper answers to, and which these <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and all Christians generally lived under, only with that difference which that dispensation of the Old had in it from this of the New. As that those were more Shadowy, and in their immediate Ordination but Types, as their Baptism then pointed forth immediately, their total deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> as then Baptized unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the Cloud, and the Sea (but yet under that to us Believers is held forth our Baptism as union into Christ (of whom <hi>Moses</hi> was a Type) and the deliverance of our Souls from Hell and Satan.) Whereas our Ordinances now have that outward Rind shaled off, and Christ only and Baptism un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, are barely and nakedly held forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I shall but prosecute two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, which to me seem natural as to this assertion out of the Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these two Ordinances of Baptism and the Lord's Supper here particularly specified, and so consequently concerning all other parts of Instituted Worship under the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Obser. I. Observe first, <hi>That these Ordinances were generally received, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Christians of those times.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obser. II. Observe secondly, <hi>That these Ordinances are to continue to the end of the World.</hi>

                  <p>To prove the first Observation, I remark the Note of Universallity which the Apostle useth. As he says that those <hi>Israelites</hi> were Types of us; and their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances Types of ours, so in making the parallel between us and them, he carefully inserts this, that as all of them were partakers, and lived under those Ordinances then; so all of us Christians do partake, or ought to do, of these Sacraments that answer unto those Types of theirs now. <hi>Of the Fathers</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>in the Wilderness,</hi> he says it no less than five times. <hi>All our Fathers were in the Cloud, and all passed through the Sea, and were all baptized unto Moses in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink.</hi> And answerably concerning the Christians of those times, he utters it in all their names, and involves himself, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>We are all Partakers of that one Bread.</hi> And says the same of Baptism, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>We are all baptised by one Spirit, into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and do all drink,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. <hi>Know ye not, that so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ally received Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Practice of all Christians: <hi>Know ye not that so many of us as were baptised,</hi> that is, that whoever of us that profess Baptism into Christ, profess Baptism into his Death, as the thing intended by it. The <hi>Ʋs</hi> there, is the generality of Christians, distinguished usually by that word from Heathens, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 7, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6. <hi>To Ʋs there is but one God,</hi> &amp;c. that is, we Christians profess all, and generally so. And his scope being to shew how Sanctification flows from being in Christ; His argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is drawn from a general principle of the <hi>[Ʋs]</hi> of Christians. As many of us (to a man as we use to say) as have been baptised into Christ, and do profess that part of Religion are all taught, that the import thereof is, to be therewith baptized into his death. So that his expression, as many of us, imports not, as if some were, and some were not baptised (for then his Argument of Sanctification had not been binding to the generality of Christians, which it is evident, it was in his intention) but it imports the contrary, that as many as were Christians, were all Baptized, and were taught this to be the meaning of that great point and principle of Religion, That as they were Baptized into Christ thereby; so also into into his death.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:154381:18"/>
                  <p> I observe also out of this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. That it was in Esteem, yea, and taken for granted, a point of the then Religion, to receive the Lords Supper. For ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how he Reasons against their Eating in the Idol's Temple, things Sacrifised to Idols, ver. 21. <hi>Ye cannot Drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils: Ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's Table, and of the Table of Devils.</hi> He set these two, one against the other; <hi>To Eat in the Idol's Temple,</hi> as a point of Heathenish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and <hi>to partake of the Lord's Supper,</hi> as a point of our Christian Profession. Now that he might be sure at once, for ever to knock down that Idolatrous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, he useth this Argument drawn from that, which according to all the then received Principles, could not be denyed. He Argues with them in this manner, a main practice of your Christian profession, which you all take up, and of which you must in effect Renounce your Profession, if you Renounce this Practice, is the Lord's Supper, It is the outward Badge of your Christian Religion; and you must utterly renounce that, if you will needs also practice this other of Eating in the Idol's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for there is a Contradiction between them, <hi>Ye cannot Drink the Cup of the Lord, and the Cup of Devils.</hi> Christ cares not for, your coming to his Supper, but had rather you should keep away, if you also receive the Devil's Sacraments. Thus he plainly works upon this firm ground, in which they knew he must not be at a loss, that they must continue to drink of that Cup, that they must partake of that Table, so he takes that for granted, as Sacred to them; and then infers that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of not eating in the Idol's Temple. And it is as if he had said, I know I have you fast here; That you will never forsake Assembling your selves for the Lord's Supper, or neglect to do it; this I hope you will all say presently, that you will never do: Now then saith he I tell you, you cannot partake of the Lord's Cup, and of the Devil's. Choose you whether you will give over the one or the other, upon your peril. He holds them hard to it, as this one, whist he argues from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the other. Now as to the Opinion of some Men in our Days, that profess they are not bound to the Lord's Supper, and think it is no point of any Religion, but that they can live without it, or above it; If the Devil had thought of this, yea, and had put it into the Heads of any in these Days; unto such the Apostle <hi>Paul's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument had no strength or force of Conviction. For if he had said to them, <hi>Ye cannot drink the Cup of the Lord in the Sacrament, &amp;c.</hi> (as <hi>ver.</hi> 16.) they might readily have said, or any one for them; This is no Argument to us, it reacheth not our principles, for we think not our selves obliged to drink the Cup of the Lord, nor to eat his Table. And indeed these that profess this principle, (I except the dark scrupled Seekers) can as well partake of the Mass, as of the Lord's Supper, they are all to them but Forms, the one as well as the other; and a Christian may use all, and is above all. This as to the first thing I observed, concerning these Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obs.</hi> Tne Second Observation is; <hi>that there is to be a continuance of these Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to after Ages,</hi> which out of the Scope of the Text, I demonstrate thus; That twice in the <hi>6th Verse,</hi> and in the <hi>11th verse,</hi> in making the Reddition or Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Story of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> both for Ordinances and for like Punishment due to the abuse of them, he say's, that in these they were <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Types of us, so <hi>ver.</hi> 6. (which is their Conclusion as to their Enjoyment of like Ordinances) and so <hi>ver.</hi> 11. as to our incurring the same punishment, he had from the <hi>6th verse</hi> Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of; he Subjoyns, <hi>These things were written for our Admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come.</hi> So that all Christians, that do live under, or ought to live under these Ordinances, partaking of those sins, are to partake of these punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as these <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Some of the seekers interpreting that place in Matth. 28. 20. <hi>Go Preach and Baptize, I am with you in all things, to the end of the World.</hi> (The words being in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the singular Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) would have this determine in the first Age of the Church. Whereas every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in Christ's Speeches afore, the very same Phrase in the singular also, is put to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the end of the World, or as <hi>Paul</hi> say's, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. until Christ come. In <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 40, 49. also you have the same phrase where is meant the end of this World, when the Day of Judgment comes, as also plainly distinguisht from the end of that Age, wherein <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was destroyed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 3. And Christ also adds in this place, of <hi>Matthew</hi> 28. 20. the word alway, which means <hi>All the days or times to the end of the World:</hi> And so all the Ages between are implyed. Well but further, here
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:154381:19"/> you see that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 11. it is affirmed of the Lord's Supper, as well as Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, that they concern all them, upon whom the ends of the World in the plural are come, that is, all the Ages, that succeed each other in this last Scene of the World. So as indeed if any were to be excepted, those rather that lived in that first Age com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively should. We have lived 1600 years, since <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this, and upon us, rather than upon them, it might be said, that the ends of the World are come: I will but cast in this out of this Scripture more, and I think it is not altogether to be slighted as to his Head. You see he plainly Parallels our Sacraments, and their's as Types, and Anti-Types. Now what should be the Mystery then, that when he speaks of that Sacramental Rock, which was Christ, and says that they drunk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he would needs insert one circumstance concerning it, that is yet not so evident in the story of the Old Testament? <hi>The Rock</hi> (says he) <hi>which followed them,</hi> that is, all along through their Travel in the Wilderness. It is to be supposed the Rock stood in its own place, but <hi>Moses</hi> striking it, and a River of Water springing forth, served them with Water, not only in that place, but followed them in all their Journey in that Desert. Which the Psalmist intimates, Psal. 105. 41. <hi>He opened the Rock, and the waters gushed out, they ran in the dry places like a River.</hi> Surely this is (as here) added to no other purpose, but to make up the Parallel in our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances the Anti-Type, When God had struck Christ the Rock, and opened his side, (and 'twas for us Rebels too, (as <hi>Moses</hi> then called the <hi>Israelites)</hi> that Water and Blood came forth, which are Communicated to us in Baptism, which is a wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Water, as Blood is held forth in the Lord's Supper.) These Ordinances were as Channels cut out by God, through the Means and Conduct of which, this Rock should follow us; and that whilst the Church is in the Wilderness, and this side <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> as that did, as a Sacrament to the end of their Journey. And so in this, was the Type fulfilled to them, in the primitive Ages of the Church, and is yet to be fullfilled unto us, upon whom the ends of the World are come.</p>
                  <p>I shall now by other Arguments farther prove, that there are Ordinances, or Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Worship, under the New Testament, to continue unto the end of the World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The New Covenant hath Ordinances of Divine Worship annexed unto it, as well as the Old Covenant had; for which the Coherence of the Eighth, or Ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the latter part of the Ninth, and the beginning of the Tenth, are a clear Evidence. The Scope of that Epistle, is indeed to shew how the Worship, and Ordinances of the Old Testament, were Translated into a Worship under the New, in substance answering to it; and how Christ as an High Priest, was as Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God in his House, as <hi>Moses</hi> was, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. In the eighth Chapter, having Treated of the two Covenants, the Old and New, and by the new understanding that, wherein the promise was, <hi>That they should not need to be Taught,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. than presently upon it, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. 1. he goes on thus. <hi>Then verily the first Covenant had also Ordinances of Divine Service,</hi> which was the Tabernacle, and the Worship performed there, so, ver. 2. <hi>to</hi> ver. 7. <hi>For there was a Tabernacle made, the first where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the Candlestick and the Table, and the shew Bread; which is called the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And after the second Vail, the Tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all: Which had the Golden Censer, and the Ark of the Covenant, overlaid round about with Gold, wherein was the Golden pot that had</hi> Manna, <hi>and</hi> Aaron's <hi>Rod that budded, and the Tables of the Covenant; and over it, the Cherubims of glory, shadowing the Mercy-Seat, of which we cannot now speak particularly. Now when these things were thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, the Priests went always into the first Tabernacle, accomplishing the Service of God.</hi> I lay hold of the word <hi>also,</hi> as implying, that therefore the New Covenant hath the like Ordinances, and not only so, but observe that in God's intention, our Ordinances were the first of the two, and the chief, though their's first in time. For he say's not, the New Covenant hath also; but the Old had also; for ours were more the Substance, their's more the Type and Shadow; yet so as both must have Ordinances of Divine Worship, the New as well as the Old, whilst it continues. And ver. 10. They <hi>were appointed, but untill the time of the Reformation,</hi> or change of Worship, to be made, not of the Abolition of it; and what those Ordinances are you know.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there be no Instituted Ordinances to continue, then the second Commandment is utterly Obliterated under the Gospel, or under the times of the Gospel, in which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:154381:19"/> these Ordinances are supposed to cease. What is the difference between the first Commandment, and the second? The first Commands such Worship to God as is always, and for ever due to him, as he is God, and we Creatures, which is Termed <hi>Cultus Naturalis,</hi> Natural Worship; because due upon the account of our being Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and so Indispensible and Eternal, and continuing in Heaven, as to fear God, love him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The second Commands Instituted Worship, or such means and helps of Worship, as God Sanctifies by his Institution, as helps and means to Worship him by, and convey himself to us, which continues whilst we are on Earth. Now this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment hath been, and hath continued in all the States which Men have gone through, or shall go thorough whilst on Earth. And though the Duties have been changed as the Priesthood hath varied, or as God was pleased to signifie his good pleasure, how he meant to be Worship't; yet so as in all States on Earth, there have been some or other such Duties belonging to the Commandment in force; which sufficiently argues, that Command to have been, and to be still in force in all States.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Innocency those two Trees, the Tree of Life, and of the Knowledge of good evil, were two Sacraments Admonishing <hi>Adam,</hi> the one of his mutable condition; the other Sealing up the promise of Life. Under the Law, 'tis evident that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Worship was in force, under the Gospel which began to be Preached by <hi>John,</hi> together therewith was Baptism Instituted, of which Christ, (who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented us) did in the Name of us all, as Head; say, <hi>Thus it becomes</hi> (us) <hi>to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all Righteousness,</hi> and he began an Example unto us therein. And indeed if there were no second Command in force under the Gospel, then there were no such sin as Idolatry, or false Worship of the True God, as far as concerns the means of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. There will be no Idolatry but what is Heathenish, or the Worship of a false God: Now the Consequence is good, for the Negative part of the Command; <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy self an Image,</hi> or use false means to Worship the True God; is founded on the existence of a positive part, that there are Means or Institutions of True Worship, appointed by God. But now there is such an Idolatry and Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Worshipping God by false means, forbidden, under the New Testament. For <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Paul</hi> bids them to take heed of Will-worship, and voluntary Humility not commanded, ver. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Touch not, Tast not, Handle not: Which all are to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with the using after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men. Which things have indeed a shew of Wisdom, in Will-worship and Humility, and neglecting of the Body, not in any Honour to the satisfying of the Flesh.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> that lived to the end of that Age, at last still chargeth them to keep themselves from Idols, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 21. 'Twas an Admonition not so much against Heathenish Idolatry, which is to Worship out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly another God, as against <hi>Popish,</hi> which was coming upon the World, (as <hi>Paul</hi> also foretold both to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in his other Epistles) and for which God brought upon the Christian World, those plagues which have befaln the <hi>Grecian</hi> Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 20. and for which <hi>Rome</hi> also is Threatned, <hi>Revel. chap.</hi> 17, &amp; 18.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If there were no Ordinances, God should have no provision for his publick worship, and Christ should have no Court on Earth▪ Two things are the glory of a King, the Laws and Jurisdiction by which he Rules abroad, and the State and Reverence done him in his own House at Home. Christ is the King of Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. and therefore all are Exhorted to Worship him, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. In <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. Christ is as well Termed our High-Priest, as our Apostle. As our Apostle he hath given forth our Faith in the Doctrine, and we believe it: As our High-Priest, he is the Leader of all the Worship of the New Testament, as the High-Priest was of the Old. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle makes an Inference from this, Heb. 10. ver. 21, 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>By a new and living way which he had Consecrated for us, through the Vail, that is to say, his Flesh: And having an High-Priest over the House of God: Let us draw near with a True Heart, in full assurance of Faith, having our Hearts sprinkled from an Evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and our Bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast the profession of our Faith without wavering: (for he is Faithfull that promised) and let us consider one another, to provoke unto love and to good Works. Not forsaking the Assembling of our selves together, as the manner of some is, but Exhorting one another; and so much the more, as ye see the Day approaching.</hi> Christ is an High-Priest, therefore he hath an House, a Court on Earth, and therefore Worship, in which you must draw near
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:154381:20"/> with inward Washings and Sprinklings, (as the Priests of Old in the Type did with Water, &amp;c.) And therefore he must also have Assemblies to be Worshipt in: So <hi>ver.</hi> 25. it follows, <hi>Not forsaking the Assembling of your selves together.</hi> He exhorteth them to meet in Churches, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did in Synagogues, so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies. And now such Assemblies must have Ordinances to converse with God in, as they accordingly had Preaching and singing of Psalms, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23, 26. and Sacraments of the Lord's Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. to which all were bound; for they were to tarry one for another, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. And they being the Top Ordinance of the Gospel, their whole Assembling or Meeting was Denominated from it, Acts 20. v. 6. <hi>When the Disciples met to break Bread,</hi> and 1 Cor. 11. 20. <hi>When ye come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's Supper.</hi> Thus their Assembling to Worship, and their eating the Lord, are promiscuously put one for the other.

                  <p>But to prove the continuance of these two Ordinances, both of Preaching, and of the Lord's Supper, we need only consider, that Christ hath Adjoyned his promise to them both. Christ's promise is annexed, to that of Preaching, Matth. 28. 20. <hi>Teaching them to do what ever I have Commanded you, and Lo I am with you to the end of the World;</hi> and as for the Lord's Supper, <hi>Paul</hi> expresly says, <hi>As I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord, so I deliver to you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 23. It is therefore one of these Commands of Christ; <hi>And do this</hi> (said Christ, Luke 22. 19.) <hi>in Remembrance of me,</hi> which is there expressed as a Command, and implyed by the Apostle, 1 Cor. 11. 2. <hi>I praise you, that you keep the Ordinances, as I delivered them to you;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of this of the Lord's Supper was one, and a great one insisted on throughout that Chapter. And writing to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and giving a warning to them, and to those that should live in the times when Popery should over-spread the World, (of which speaks, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 3. to 13.) He Admonisheth a Remedy against these Seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ver. 15. <hi>To hold fast the Traditions which you have been taught, whether by Word or by Epistle.</hi> This, though given to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> yet must needs more properly concern those that should live in the times, when the perverting of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances should come into the World: For then is the most need of that Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when there is an Advance of Popish Innovations, then is the proper season for it. And therefore though it concerned those <hi>Thessalonians</hi> in these times, when the Mystery of Iniquity began to work; yet upon the same ground more fully it concerns us in these times when this Mystery of Iniquity hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. For their sakes therefore, this was written upon whom these latter ends of the World are come; and so concerns us and our Forefathers, who Reformed from Popery, to hold firmly to Scriptures and Ordinances, as a preservative against Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> goes further, 1 Cor. 11. 26. <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lord's Death till he come,</hi> and again, <hi>do this in Remembrance of me.</hi> It is as if he had said, Christ must be absent till the day of Judgment, and the Heaven of Heavens must contain him till then; and to keep up the Remembrance of that great love of his, in dying, he hath appointed this as the Memorial of him whilst absent, till he come. And what manner of coming that is, which puts the Period to this his absence, the Angels hath resolved us, and also how he will come, Acts 1. 10, 11. <hi>And while they looked stedfastly towards Heaven, as he went up, behold two Men stood by them in white Apparel, which also said, ye Men of</hi> Galilee, <hi>why stand ye gazing up into Heaven? This same Jesus which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall so come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> If ye say, he is already come in Spirit; do but consider who was more fill'd with the Spirit, than Christ himself? and yet he was not only Baptized, but in being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, professeth his observance of it to be this end, to fulfill all Righteousness, and he seems also to speak in the Name of us, <hi>i. e.</hi> of all Believers, and so it becomes us to fulfill, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 3. 15. because he, as the Head, gave example to all his succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Members. And not only so, but though he thereupon received the Spirit, and was in Spirit in the Wilderness, and that above measure, as <hi>John</hi> Testifies of him,

                  <p>THO' this Ordinance of Excommunication be described many ways, As 1. <hi>Let him be to the as an Heathen and a Publican,</hi> Mat. 18. 17. And 2. <hi>With such an one no not to eat,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 11. And 3. It is expressed as a <hi>Casting out of the Church,</hi> John Epist. 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. yet over and above all this, it is called a delivering unto Satan, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. And now that by this phrase more is intended than simply an ejection out of the Church, these following Arguments evince.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That word of <hi>delivering to Satan,</hi> imports something positive, distinct from, and including more in it than Ejection out of the Church. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a giving up a Person to receive a positive punishment from Satan; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is more than a casting out of the Church. This is apparent, for as the Sentence of a Judge (tho' it doth not pitch upon the consequent of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Death, <hi>viz.</hi> the sending a Man to Hell, nor doth he express the Sentence he judgeth him to by that) imports more than a mere casting the condemned Man out of the World, for the Sentence directly expresseth that punishment which the Judge hath power to inflict, <hi>viz.</hi> The carrying of the Man back to the Gaol from whence he came, and from thence to the place of Execution, and that there he should be hang'd (tho' he doth not put it into the Sentence, in the Name of the King to deliver this Man to the Devil to be Damn'd) so in the Sentence of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, there is more implied than a casting of the Person out of the Society of Christians; for the Judgment, the Sentence, and that in the Name and Power of Christ is to deliver unto Satan. It is not to leave the Man unto Satan only, but it is to deliver unto Satan, which is an Act of Authority, to give him up unto him, as to give a Man up to the Jaylor or to the Tormentor. Thus when God speaks to Satan of <hi>Job,</hi> he is in thine hand (saith he) I have given him up unto thee, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 12. and <hi>ch.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
                  <p>But you will say, the bare casting of a Person out of the Church still imports but the consequent of it, <hi>viz.</hi> A delivering him up to Satan, as to deprive of Light is to give up to Darkness. But unto that it's answered, that what the formal Sentence of Excommunication pitches upon, is more than a mere consequent of the Person's being cast out, or is more than accidental: For what the very formal Sentence of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication pitches upon, and which is in the power of Christ, is not barely leaving the Man unto Satan, but a delivering of him unto Satan. Yea this is in the very definition of Excommunication, and therefore is not to be omitted. For that which is the positive form of the Sentence, and by which Excommunication is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, containeth the essential terminative object or matter of it; that a Man is so delivered up to the Devil, as in the Name, so in the Power of the Lord Jesus; now this, <hi>viz. The delivering of a Person to Satan in the Name of Christ,</hi> is a distinct character of Excommunication, as that is of Baptism, <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> As in the act of Ordination, when you say, I Ordain thee a Minister or a Pastor, it imports truly what is said, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Metaphor, but a reality; so in this Act of Excommunication, it is with the Power of the Lord Jesus to deliver such an one unto Satan, therefore when Christ doth give Commission to the Church to do it, in his Name and Power, this being the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Sentence, his Power concurreth to it. Now this is more than to throw out of the Church, for if there was only a Power to throw the Man out of the Church in the Name of Christ, without a Power to deliver unto Satan, the Church would have no more Prerogative than what is a common thing to all Societies. But now when the Church can give Satan Power over a Man, this is an act of the Power of Jesus Christ indeed, peculiar to a Church of his.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:154381:21"/> 2. Again, If Excommunication puts a Man into a different state than merely that of being again thrown into the World under Satan, as the World is, that never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Christ, then it imports some distinct thing from casting out of the Church. But a Person's being Excommunicated, is a differing thing from being in the World or under Satan, as the World is: And it is so not only in this respect, that they that are in the World, and never were of any Church, are so in the World as withal they never were of any Church, as this Man hath been, but it is also different in respect of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Power that Satan should have over this Excommunicated Person. Which is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this, because that Power which Satan hath over a Man Unregenerate in the World, is to carry him on to Sin, to work effectually in the Children of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. therefore we are said, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. to be Translated out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Darkness, that is, of Satan, who, as the Strong Man, keepeth all in Peace. But so to be delivered to Satan cannot be the meaning of Excommunicating a Man, for the intent of this is to destroy the flesh, and to save his Spirit, therefore it is not to deliver a Man unto Satan, so as to be a Man of the World out of the Church. Again the difference is evident by this, that this Man's punishment is in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, greater than that of a Man Unregenerate in the World, for as the Apostle saith, the Saints may eat with them of the World, but with such a one as is Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, are <hi>not to eat,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Excommunication imports a positive punishment, for it is a spiritual Revenge. The <hi>Negative</hi> throwing out of the Church is but that which is common to all Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>But the Weapons of our Warfare</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>are mighty through God, having in a readiness to revenge all Disobedience,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4, 3, 6. As will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if we do but lay all these following things together. 1. That Satan is ready to punish the Man in his Spirit by Terrors,, and to fet on his sins with horrors, if he have leave from Christ. 2. This Man is by the Power of Christ given up and not left only to him. 3. He is given up to Satan to punish and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Whom I have delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme,</hi> that is, that they may learn how horrid a sin it is to blaspheme, by what Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan inflicts, the word translated to Learn is in the <hi>Greek</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is, to be disciplined as a Child is, to learn by Rods, so that being delivered unto Satan to learn how dreadful it is to blaspheme, implies that Satan is to whip them, that they may learn by a suitable punishment what it is to blaspheme, by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's casting Hellish Terrors into their Mind.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And the Analogy of a Man's sin when he deserveth Excommunication, and the punishment it self seem to be suitable, and that the sin deserves it in a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. For when a man is obstinate, the frame of his Spirit is such, that he doth not regard the Ordinances, therefore to be cast out of the Communion of Saints would not be a sore punishment to him, neither would that be enough to bring him in, and therefore the only way to bring this man in is, to have Satan set on his back with terrors, as in the work of humiliation at first.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Then again, such a man hath grieved the Holy Ghost the Comforter, and therefore he is suitably given up unto Satan as an Accuser and Tormentor: And so the phrase of delivering unto Satan seems to mean a Spiritual punishment opposite unto joy in the Holy Ghost, which is the fruit of obedience; that as the <hi>Kingdom of God is Joy and Righteousness, and Peace,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. <hi>The Peace of God shall guard your hearts through the working of the Holy Ghost,</hi> Phil. 4. 7. So <hi>that estate</hi> this Man is given up to, is an estate of terror and darkness; it is not to be an Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Man; but it is to be under the bondage of Satan.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And then again, Excommunication is called the retaining of Sin, and binding of Sin, a binding of Sin upon the Conscience: Now the question is, <hi>Quo efficiente,</hi> by whom this should be done? This sentence of delivering him unto Satan, implies, that Satan hath power given him to set his Sin on upon his Conscience, and that he is able to set Sin on upon the Conscience is evident from other Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Again we do find by experience, that where Excommunication is not Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred rightly, there the Saints oftentimes are given up to very great terrors of Conscience, and that from Satan, and left to great Temptations; the Lord sometime working without the Ordinance, that which he doth work by the Ordinance of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, when it is rightly administred.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This fruit doth seem to have been in that <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. for the Apostle
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154381:21"/> desires them to forgive him, lest he should be swallowed up with over much sorrow, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. It seems to be more than an humane sorrow, or more than a sorrow which would have been from the Holy Ghost's working, for that would not have swallowed a Man up, It implies therefore that he was in Satan's Power, <hi>We art not ignorant</hi> (saith he) <hi>of his devices,</hi> ver. 11. and that his devices were to keep this poor man in his clutches. And the phrase there, <hi>swallowed up,</hi> answereth to what is said of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in other cases, <hi>He goeth up and down seeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8. <hi>Whom he may drink up,</hi> so the word signifieth, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And again, Excommunication may seem to be more than meerly a throwing out of the Church, by that parallel of a greater Excommunication than what is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, that <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 22. Which was not only to give a Man up to Satan for a time, but to give him up into an eternal curse, when they saw that a Man which had been a Professor, loved not the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, as sinning against the Holy Ghost. Now if the Church in that case hath power more than to eject, <hi>viz.</hi> To eject with an eternal curse, never to receive a Man more, which God ratifieth in Heaven, then in the ordinary casting a Man out of the Church, tho' there be hope that he may be recalled again, the way of doing it, is not merely a private punishment, or a throwing him out of the Church, which should work upon him, in a moral way of a sorrowful thought, and sense, that he is cast out from among the People of God, but it is a giving him up to Satan to terrifie him, God sanctifying that, as he doth other Afflictions to bring him in.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If Excommunication were nothing else, but a seclusion from the Church, then for the substance of the Act it would be no more than a continued suspension; for if the substance of the act be the same, they do not differ, tho' the one be done out of an Act of Authority, the other not. They will admit him again upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, if he be Excommunicated, as well as when Suspended, and if he do not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, they will not admit him, no more than when he is Excommunicated. And when he is Excommunicated he needs not a new admission, as when he is Suspended and Repents he doth not. So that for the extrinsecal act, they are all one. But Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication hath a Spiritual punishment attending it; and therefore answerably when that <hi>Corinthian</hi> was to be received again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. They are not simply to pass an Act of Forgiveness, and to Receive him again, but to comfort him also.</p>
                  <p>If it be Objected, that we do not always see this effect, of a Spiritual punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment following Excommunication.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We Reply First; That there have been very few Excommunications in the World, that have been from those that have had the right power of doing of it, And those Excommunications which have been Administred by the Rightful Persons, yet have not been due, because proceeding on too flight Occasions, and such as have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Excommunication.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have, in their Excommunication, trusted more to the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, when it should have come to a Writ, <hi>de Excommunicato capiendo,</hi> or to hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a Man as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Banishing him, or depriving him of his Estate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have confided, I say, in the Magistrate's power, and in his punishment, more than in Excommunication, or else why have they Recourse to it, to make a Man Repent? Whereas if they would wholy leave it unto God, to inflict that which he hath ordained to be the punishment, and that sufficient too, (for all his means are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as the Apostle say's, <hi>the Weapons of our Warfare, are mighty through God to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge all Disobedience,)</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 4. It would prove Efficacious enough to all ends and purposes, and sufficient, for such a Man, would that punishment be. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they put confidence in an Arm of Flesh to bring him in, as if that were more an effectual means, than the power of God; therefore God makes his Ordinance to be but as an Arm of Flesh, and to have no other effect or fruit, than what the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates punishment hath.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is with this, as with all other Ordinances, which do not alway's attain their end, which they are principally ordained for, because that God works freely by them. Preaching is ordained to Convert, yet there are Millions of Men, to whom the word is preached, upon whom it hath not this effect; for <hi>although they have all heard, yet they have not all believed,</hi> Rom. 10. 18. It is enough, that God hath ordained it to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154381:22"/> such an end, and it takes place in some, as the Apostle speaks; and so also hath this very Ordinance wrought in that very way, as divers Instances might be shewn. </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Jesus Christ always fulfils what he hath promised, Mat. 18. 20. <hi>I will be with you, and in the midst of you,</hi> either to bless this my Ordinance, by giving Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or giving up to a Reprobate Sense. So as Excommunication hath usually its <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Parkerus De polit. Eccles. lib. cap.</hi> 5.</note> effect one way or other, the Man is given up unto Satan, and if it have not that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect effect of Terrifying of him, so as to bring him to Repentance, he is given up to a Reprobate Sense, Satan entring into him, as into <hi>Judas,</hi> so that he turneth a Persecutor, as was frequent in the primitive times, that Men once Excommunicated turned Persecutors. They forsook the Assemblies of the Saints, which was a step to the sin against the Holy Ghost, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25, 26, 27. When they were thrown out, they could come at them no more, and so were given up unto Satan for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> In <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. all that is said is only, <hi>let him be to thee, as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tben and a Publican.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There he speaks in the Language of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so expresseth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication only, by what casting out of the Synagogues was amongst them as elsewhere, Christ expresseth the Ordinances of the Gospel, under the <hi>Jewish</hi> Phrase, <hi>leave thy Gift at the Altar,</hi> Matt. 5. 24. Now the <hi>Jews</hi> did not know what it was to be delivered unto Satan, and therefore no wonder if Christ did not expresly speak of it in that place of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17.</p>
                  <p>But 2. One place expounds another, and that which he calleth there, Matth. 18. 17. <hi>Let him be to thee an Heathen and a Publican,</hi> is in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. called a delivering unto Satan.</p>
                  <p>Then 3. This delivering unto Satan, was exemplified in the punishment of <hi>Judas,</hi> for after he was gone out, (as it is judged by <hi>Piscator</hi> and others, he did not receive the Lords Supper, but was sent out) presently the Devil entred into him; he was a Branch cast out, <hi>John</hi> 15. 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though our Saviour Christ expresseth it to them in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Language, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. Yet to the same Apostles, when this Ordinance of Excommunication came to be exercised in a Church, his Spirit expresseth more fully what was the intent of that Ordinance, not simply to throw a Man out, to avoid outward couverse with him, and in that Sense to be as an Heathen and a Publican, but to be a delivering unto Satan. So that as the Church of the Gospel in the priviledges of it, exceedeth that of the Law, and that priviledge they had in the Synagogues, so the dispriviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Man from the Communion of the Saints under the Gospel, hath an higher punishment, than the Synagogues knew.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When Christ said, let him be to thee as an Heathen and a Publican, he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth there not so much what the Churche's Censure pitcheth upon, but what the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is, <hi>viz.</hi> the manner of their converse afterwards towards, him, therefore he saith, <hi>Let him be to thee,</hi> he saith, not only let him be to the Church, <hi>but to thee.</hi> He expresseth it by what is the consequent, but in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. He expresseth the formal Sentence, when the Apostle saith, no not with such an one to eat, he expresseth there indeed the consequent of the Sentence, but delivering unto Satan, is put into the Sentence it self.</p>
                  <p>I shall urge one Argument more, to prove that Excommunication is not meerly an Humane Ejection out of a Society, but an Ordinance in the Church Established by Christ's Institution, because Christ hath given us express Rules by Church Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and censures; we find as direct Rules chalked out, for the Series and Order of proceedings therein, as any State can take for ordering proceedings in Civil Causes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the matter of Christ's Censures, what we are to convert in Men, and how we must apply those Censures, we have our Limits and Rules in the word, so as we need no Orders or Canons to be made to make new matter, or the chief matter of Church Censures. For plainly it is told us, that <hi>Sin</hi> only is the Subject of Church-Cognisance, that it is a Transgression of some Law of God, <hi>Them that sin,</hi> (say's <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 20.) <hi>Rebuke;</hi> Now what is sin, and not sin, the word is the sole Judge of, and a perfect Rule of.</p>
                  <p>And 2. It is Scandalous sin that is the matter of Censure, sin judged so by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154381:22"/> light, and received Principles; sin that goes afore to Judgment, that you may read afar off, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 24. Doubtless Dispensations and sins controverted, are not to be made the Subject of Church Censures; for if the weak are not to be received to such, then neither are they to be cast out for such. Instruction may be used to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences ignorant, as the phrase is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 25. but Admonition only for sins taken for granted, and professed to be sins by the light of Nature, and the common light of Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 8, 3. For how also shall all fear? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the ways of dealing with such sinners, we have Admonition, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and Rejection prescribed.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Admonition, <hi>Them that sin Rebuke,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 20. and that not privately, (if the sin be open) but publickly <hi>afar off;</hi> to the end others may fear.</item>
                     <item>2. For Excommunication, we have Warrant after Admonition, Tit. 3. 10. <hi>After the first and second Admonition Reject,</hi> which in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5. called <hi>delivering unto Satan,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>3. We have Order given, for the Degrees of proceedings in these, as orderly as any Law can make provision for the Indemnity of Men Innocent and Just, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any Civil Court in order to amend Men.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. If the sin be private, so as thou alone knowest it, <hi>that thy Brother sin against thee,</hi> Mat. 11. 15. <hi>Go and tell him his fault, between him and thee alone, if he hear and Repent,</hi> (as 'tis, Luke 17. 3.) <hi>thou shalt forgive him, and it shall go no further.</hi> This provision hath Christ took, to prevent the Reputation of Persons, so to mend them, as not to blaze their faults; and this not for one so sining, but if seven times, that is, never so oft, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 4.</p>
                  <p>If 2. He neglect to hear thee, that is, Repents not, then take two or three and tell him of it afore them, and if he denies not the Fact, and yet Repents not, then thou hast two or three Witnesses of his not denying the Fact, and yet of his Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy and Hardness in not Relenting, and of his Impenitency so it follows; That in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses, <hi>every word may be established,</hi> that is brought into publick.</p>
                  <p>Therefore 3. Now the matter though but private at first, is ripened for Church-cognisance, <hi>If he neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church.</hi> But if it were a sin that is publick, that it is though, privately committed, yet made known, <hi>commonly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,</hi> and so commonly known, as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. Then the Church is to take immediate notice of it publickly, without telling it in private; and those that can accuse, should impeach, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. he shews, and also 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>But 4. If it be a sin that is suspected, and cannot be proved, (whether common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reported or private) and that by two or three Witnesses, the Officers are to cast it out of the Church proceeding, and not to receive it, <hi>Receive not an Accusation,</hi> so as to proceed in it, unless it appears evident by two or three Witnesses, This Rule is given about Admonishing Officers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19: But it regards also every Man else, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16. Then, when any sin is thus made of publick Cognisance, 1. They are to Admonish. 2. To Excommunicate in case of Obstinacy and Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                  <p>To conclude all in a word, if Christ had not setled by his Institution the Order, Discipline and Government of his Churches, if he had not given Established Rules for Church Censures, Admonitions and Excommunication: If a certain Platform of Church-Government, had not been fixed by him, we should have no Warrant to endeavour a Reformation, when the Order and Discipline of the Churches of Christ is impaired, and almost lost. For there would be no Rule to go by in, such a Reformation. And without a Rule of Divine Institution, there could be no setting things right, when amiss, no <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. Nor could we produce any Warrant to Advance the Spiritual Scepter and Kingdom of our Lord Christ, if we did not know, by the Rules and Laws of his own Institution, what it is.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Divine Institution of a Congregational Church. That it is not Secondary, or Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon a Charter given to the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, as virtually included therein, but is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and proper to it. That Christ Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such a Church, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and gave the Power of the Key's to it. That such Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches were Primitive and Apostolical, proved from the Instances of Churches planted by the Apostles. That the Constitution and Order of such Churches, is most fitly suited to the Edification of the Saints, and most exactly accommodated to their various Conditions. That Christ hath not only Instituted a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Church, but hath appointed what the Extent and Limits of it should be.</p>
               </argument>
               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>That the Institution of Particular Churches is not virtual only, or Secondary, and Dependent on the Charter given to the Church Universal, but immediate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to them, as Particular Churches.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THEY, who assert the General Church to be a Political Body, seem to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into those two several ways of explaining it. 1. That it cometh to be a Political Body <hi>Ascendendo,</hi> so making a Congregation to be <hi>Ecclesia prima,</hi> a Church first designed in the Institution, and which the Institution falleth upon; but yet, that by the vertue of the same Commission, that Saints make up a particular Church, many Churches may make up one Church, and more of those Churches may make up a greater Church, for Appeals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so by the like reason, the Universal Church cometh to be a Political Body, the National, or Provincial Churches, being but <hi>Ecclesiae ortae,</hi> removes from and representations of those that are <hi>Ecclesiae primae,</hi> the first Churches which are Congregations. This
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:154381:24"/> opinion, I shall consider, when I come to discourse of the Nature of Synods, and their Subordination.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others form the Institution to be <hi>descendendo,</hi> as asserting the first principal Charter, to be given to the Church Universal, so as that is by Institution first a Church, and particular Congregations have it but by a derived right, as lesser Leases have their's out of a greater Charter. And the reason that is given, is this, that when the Church Universal was but so many (or if it were again reduced to so small a number) as might meet in one place, they met by vertue of being the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal; but that it afterwards was multiplied to so many, as that they must meet in several places, which is the occasion of forming particular Churches, this is acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and occasional, and so they are to be regarded as one Church still, and so that first fundamental Institution goes on. For number or multiplication of Churches, is not the object of God's Institution; for God ordained not first that Churches should be many. If these many particular Churches are fram'd, it is with <hi>Proviso,</hi> and <hi>Sub conditione;</hi> namely, only when they are so far multiplied. Nor did Christ give such command, that when they did arise to such a number, they should make seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Churches, only necessity doth that, which yet still proceeds by vertue of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral grant.</p>
                  <p>But to refute this, consider, 1. That if there had been a time in which the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church was so small under the New Testament, living also together as they might have met in one place, they had not met by vertue of their being the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church, or being a Mystical body to Christ, as the Church Universal is: For they had been a Church Mystical unto Christ, tho' they had not so met, even as the Church Mystical now is a Body to Christ, though it never doth thus meet. Yea, those Saints who then made this Church Universal, might have Worshipped apart, and singly, and God might have ordered it so; therefore that they should meet, and meet together fixedly for supernatural Ends, and Ordinances, this dependeth over and above, upon a special Will of God superadded to this Universal Church as such. If therefore when the Universal Church was no more than could meet in one place, it must have had for those fixed Meetings, and the priviledges of them, a Divine appointment, and if it met then, it must be by vertue of a special Institution: Then afterward, when it was divided into many Congregations, they must meet by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Divine Institution too. If the Universal Church was no more than could meet in one, yet they must then have, for those fixed meetings, met by a special Institution and Priviledges, and afterward when they are many, they met by the same special Institution also; and so what at first suited their condition, when they were no more than could meet in one place, suiteth their condition afterward, when they are multiplied.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They could not then meet <hi>Qua</hi> Universal Catholick Church, for the Universal Catholick Church, is called such in respect of it's being in all Nations, both Jews and Gentiles. Whereas the Institution of a particular Church is the same, whether there be no more Saints, than can meet in one place at once, or whether there be more. When they are many, those many do set up several Congregations upon the same special ground that the Universal Church did set up a Meeting. And the Universal Church did so meet in a Congregation, by a special superadded ground over and above their being a Church Universal, for it further depended upon God's Will, that they should all meet thus together fixedly, for they might have met but occasionally some times, and they might have met in several companies, or they might have Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped privately, and God's Ordinance might only have been so administred; for if they meet for these Ordinances <hi>qua</hi> Church Universal, then in Heaven they should meet for them too. So then that they should meet in one fixed Society for publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, is by Institution. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Institution of meeting together, was rather made, and suited for the Saints when multiplied, than in respect of their being one body, as an Universal Church.</p>
                  <p>For 1. Under the New Testament there was never a time (that we know of) after the Jewish Law came to be dissolved, that this Universal Church could meet in one, for although not at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> yet surely in whole <hi>Judea</hi> there were more scatter'd up and down, than could have met in one place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Under the New, Testament, when the Church Universal is multiplied to all Nations, (in respect of which it is called the Church Catholick, by way of distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:154381:24"/> from the <hi>Jews)</hi> then it is so scattered, as that they cannot meet together, no not by way of Representation. So as indeed this pretended principle, that Institutions should mainly fall upon the Church Universal, is such as was never practised, nor <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant de facto,</hi> neither at first nor at last.</p>
                  <p>Then 3. We may observe that God did frame the Institution of his Churches, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what, in the Wisdom of his Counsel, he hath determined, and foresaw would fall out. His Institutions are such, as he in Wisdom knew would best suit the condition of Saints in all Ages to come, under the Gospel. He therefore ordered par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations, as the most commodious Seat of publick Worship, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Order, and as the best, and fittest security to preserve the Saints from Scandal, and also the means of maintaining among them, the most intire kind of Communion, which could be attained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That particular Congregations do not meet as Assemblies for publick Worship and Ordinances, by vertue of a Charter given first to the Church Ʋniversal,</hi> is evident from these Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If they do meet by vertue of the general Charter of the Church Universal, and they needed no other Warrant than that: Then if they meet occasionally only, some Saints together at one time, and others at another, and not fixedly, whether for Government or Worship, they do thereby satisfie the Obligation they have, by vertue of the general Warrant. And indeed, to make running Churches, and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Saints, up and down in the World, would more satisfie the obligation of the general Charter, and come up more nearly to it: Therefore for them to have a fixed special Tye to particular Churches in a constant way, when the Churches are many, must needs be by a further special Institution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If they thus meet by vertue of their being the Church Universal, then they met by vertue of it only in all times, and then afore the Law was given; and so the same Government, that is now pleaded for, from the Notion of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, should have been then. And then likewise after the Law, the <hi>Jews</hi> should have met by the Law of the Church-Catholick; And if so, there should be now the like meeting for publick Worship of the whole Church, as was then, <hi>viz.</hi> three times a year. Was their meeting by vertue of their Catholick Communion, or as they were a Nation? As they were a Nation surely: For if multitudes out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations had been converted, they had not been, (as the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and the like, where they had not been bound to the Ceremonial Law, neither were the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that lived out of the Land dispersed) bound to come up to the <hi>Synedrim.</hi> And suppose that they had been the Church Universal, yet that they were cast into a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional way, was by Institution, over and above that universal consideration, as they were the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Institution of a particular Church, depend on the Charter first given to the Church Universal, then where there are more of Believers, and more of Elders, there would be more of the keys, if they had them by vertue of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church; for why? there would be more of the Universal Church in such a Body. The Institution therefore must fall primarily upon their being a particular Body to Christ, meeting in his Name, by his special Commission, though the Persons be but two or three, that is a few in number, which argues, that he doth not put his Institution barely upon their Membership, or Station in the Church Universal, but upon the Formality of their being his Body thus united; his Blessing is given to them, as formed up by Institution, whether they be Saints more or fewer, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews</hi> also it was in their Cities and Towns, as well as they were a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in their Nation.</p>
                  <p>According to this Asserted Charter of the Church Universal, when as he saith, tell the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19. it should be meant primarily, of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, for the Institution and Rule for Church proceedings, would fall first upon it. But he speaks plainly of a particular Church, (and the Christian Church, being as then to be gathered, when he uttered it; if he would have made a Charter to the Universal, then had been the fittest time to have exprest it) for he declareth his Institution there, when he had but a few Disciples about him, and those with him, and yet declareth his Institution for all Ages, to tell it to that next Church, whereof a Man is a Brother. And if the Church Universal had been intended here, then the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:154381:25"/> Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> had not been intended as the pattern; which would overthrow the main Assertion of our Presbyterian Brethren. </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The truth is, that the meeting of the Universal, is but occasional, for in all the Ages, that the Church was to run through, it hath seldom been, yea, could never be: And when that which we call General Councils have been, they were rather for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Doctrine, than for Government, or for Appeals about persons, and that the Institution could not fall upon. It's true in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. the word <hi>Church</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken indefinitely, and for the Church Universal; but yet not as an Institution Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, therefore he doth not say, he will give the keys to it, but unto <hi>Peter,</hi> as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting both Saints and Ministers, to be divided into several Bodies, as afterwards Christ should appoint it.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the Grand Charter of Church-Government, or the power of the Keys, is granted not to Ministers in particular only, excluding the People, but to the whole Body of Believers.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF any were to set down the Model of any Government whatsoever, the first and most necessary thing is, to set out first what Common-wealth, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Body Politick, should be the <hi>Substratum,</hi> the Seat of that Government, (in and among whom it is exercised;) and to set out the Bounds and Extent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by which the Jurisdiction of that Government is limited, and unto which, as the Subject matter thereof, all the particulars of that Government are suited and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, (as the Building is to it's Foundation) and also the Scituation and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Ground, which they make the Seat thereof. Therefore in the Inquisition after that Order and Frame of Government, which (we conceive) Christ hath instituted for his Church, it is most proper to begin in seeking out what kind of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy or Society it is, which should be that proper Adequate, intire Seat and Subject of this Government, what the Bounds and Extent thereof are, wherein Christ would have his Government exercised, and within which confined. I call the Church <hi>Sedes</hi> or Seat, not in Allusion to that Ancient Phrase used, for the Subject of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Jurisdiction, (which Phrase yet strengthens this use of it) but in Allusion to that Scripture Phrase, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. where he calls the Church <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is, the <hi>Seat or Ground of Truth,</hi> and as of Truth there, so (say I) of Worship and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This therefore as the Foundation, shall be the Subject of my Discourse, and upon the finding the true Abuttments hereof, doth the ending and determining of most of those Suits and Quarrels of this Age, about Church-Government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. The first Charter granted by the Founder, and the Patterns of those Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Builders the Apostles, and the proportions of those Primitive Churches, must be our guide herein.</p>
                  <p>Begin we therefore to enquire what is the true purport of the first grand Charter of all the rest, and what help that will contribute hereunto; as we find in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>And I will give unto thee the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven; whatsoever thou shalt loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Where first, he no sooner mentions, (and it is the first mention) a New Church to be Builded by him under the New Testament, but he, together therewith, makes mention of Keys, both as means of Building it, and of governing it, following the Metaphor of an House therein. And <hi>Peter</hi> having newly made a Confession, that Jesus was the Son of God, he being declared and owned by him as such, Christ ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himself again to him, as the Son of God indeed, speaks of Building, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving anew of his House, as a Prerogative proper to him, as the Son; which, to the same purpose, the Apostle in like manner alledgeth, Heb. 3. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Christ, as the Son over his own House, is the Builder thereof,</hi> which Prerogative he here holds forth, saying, <hi>I will Build my Church,</hi> and <hi>I will give Keys.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> he intends, is the Church of the New Testament, which (the Son being himself come) was to be moulded and built anew by him, especially after his Ascension. And <hi>the Keys</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:154381:25"/> he means, are <hi>the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> (as the State of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel is called;) which, to shew he is the Son, and hath all power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, he professeth to dispose of anew, (as the Keys themselves were new) to another sort of Persons than before; The Keys of Knowledge and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment having been before in the Hands of High Priests and <hi>Levites,</hi> &amp;c. Now as the Church was to be of a new frame, and the keys were new, so he declares a new disposement of them to other Persons than the former. So that this place strengthens the Assertion, <hi>That Christ as the Son, is the Builder of his Church,</hi> Heb. 3. 3. 6. and the Institutor of all power and means of Building in it; and also it proves that the Frame and Government of the Church under the Old Testament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by <hi>Moses</hi> to those that sat in his Chair, cannot be a set Rule of the Frame and Form of Government, of the Church under the New. For Christ the Son, being come, shews his Prerogative by declaring the Old to be done away, saying, I will Build, I wil give the keys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilst he speaks of a New, the Old is done away. yea, the Persons to whom, and the Extent and Limits of the power are to be set out by him, as well as what those keys shall be, by which he will Build and have his Church governed; and he therefore says to <hi>Peter, I do give to thee.</hi> In that he singles him out electively, it argues his special Designation of the Subject or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, (who ever they be) to whom he will bequeath them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>Peter</hi> here in this promise of the keys for the future to be given, should stand in a Representative Respect, and not meerly Personal, all Writers in all Ages, and all sides, though in <hi>Peter's</hi> Name, laying several claims unto these keys, do uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally acknowledge and observe. Some say, the grant is to <hi>Peter</hi> only, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Believer, having made Confession of his Faith, that Christ was the Son of God; and therefore Representing the Church of Believers, as unto whom all Church power should be first given. Others assert, this grant to be made to <hi>Peter</hi> as an Apostle, and so Representing the Apostles and Ministers only. Thirdly, others as the Papists, vindicate a personal priviledge of <hi>Peter's,</hi> above all the other Apostles, yet therein Representing his supposed Successor, the Bishops of <hi>Rome.</hi> Learned <hi>Cameron</hi> almost alone, would have it, that this was a personal priviledge to <hi>Peter,</hi> wherein none others did succeed him. Thus much seems evident to us, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Christ speaks unto <hi>Peter,</hi> under a double consideration in these words, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and the words before. The one was meerly <hi>Personal,</hi> and therein he speaks to him, under his <hi>own proper Name,</hi> Simon <hi>Son of</hi> Bar-Jonas, and so pronounceth him Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for that his Confession, which accordingly expressed his personal priviledge, (which under that Name he had even from Circumcision) of his being Saved, without any mention of the gift of the keys. But then secondly he gives him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al a new Name, and I <hi>also say unto thee, Thou art</hi> Peter, or <hi>Rock,</hi> which was a New and Mystical Name, as the word following shew, <hi>upon this Rock.</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, answering each to other, as <hi>fides</hi> and <hi>fidelis.</hi> And under this new Name now put upon him, he gives him a further priviledge, I <hi>will give to thee the Keys,</hi> namely as thou art <hi>Peter.</hi> This was not so much in a Personal, as a Mystical consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, upon which this New Name was given him. And to strengthen this, it may be observed that God in first delivering his promises and grand Charters unto all sorts, singled out some one Man, in whose Name the grand Charter should emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently run. So <hi>Adam</hi> was fixed upon, when God, in his Name, gave the Earth unto the rest of the Sons of Men: So <hi>Abraham</hi> was singled out to Represent the Church, both of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but especially to represent the <hi>Jews</hi> who were his Children, to whom God gave the promises of the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> as representing all his Seed, and <hi>of the</hi> whole <hi>World,</hi> as representing <hi>all the Saints,</hi> Rom. 4. 13. And accordingly he did upon it change his Name from <hi>Abram,</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Thus in like manner here doth Christ deal with <hi>Peter.</hi> He first blesseth him personally as <hi>Simon,</hi> then changeth his Name to <hi>Peter,</hi> and so bequeaths this Charter of the keys, in his like representation of others, to whom in him the grant is made, as well as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. For <hi>Peter</hi> was still more forward than all the rest, to utter his Faith that Christ was the Son of God. Elsewhere indeed, (as in <hi>John</hi> 6. 69.) he speaks in the person of all the Apostles; but here where this grant is first uttered, singly in his own; And on this occasion, Christ Honoreth this Great and Eminent Confessor of him, as that Man in whose Name this great Charter should run, he bearing therein the persons of all sorts, that were to have any portion of power, whether of his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:154381:26"/> Apostles, Extraordinary Officers; or of ordinary Officers, as also of the Church of Believers, and even of all to whom ever any portion of the keys was for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be given; yet so as this Honour was peculiarly his, and he is singled out to be this common Representer of all others under the New Testament, which Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he doth bear to this Day in his Name, even as <hi>Abraham</hi> had the like Honour under the Old Testament. And to evidence this the more by the event, Christ did, in an especial manner, honour <hi>Peter</hi> to be the Founder as it were, and beginner of the New Christian Church, (as <hi>Cameron</hi> hath observed out of <hi>Tertullian)</hi> when he converted that Multitude at one Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Neither yet is this to be understood, as if those keys were given unto <hi>Peter</hi> to convey the keys unto others Derivatively, but he takes them Representatively, (and therefore it was not necessary that all power should be in <hi>Peter's</hi> person as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, otherwise than Representatively) and that not <hi>Repraesentatione Reali,</hi> as if he received all power for the Church, over her, as a King or a Parliament doth, who Represents a Common-wealth, (as the Papists and Episcopal Divines, and others say of the Officers, that they Represent the Church) but only <hi>Repraesentatione Typicali,</hi> a Typical Representation, (as <hi>Baynes</hi> Distinguisheth) that is, that power which the Church or others that were Officers unto her, should receive in themselves afterwards, he now received in a Representation both of her and them, as a common Person standing for, and spoken to for all the rest. And Christ therefore doth not say, <hi>I give,</hi> which if he had spoken to him only as an Apostle, constituting him such thereby at present, he would have done; but <hi>I will give</hi> for the future, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those whom <hi>Peter</hi> Represented here, the power was afterwards to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to, when the Lord should be pleased to declare it by himself or his Apostles.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Further as all this is spoken of <hi>Peter</hi> here as a Representative Person, so in an indefinite and general way. And as it is the first Great promise and Charter, in which all particular portions of power, to whomsoever afterwards distributed, are included, so likewise as the other first and great promises of God use to be, this is as comprehensive, so indefinite also, not designing at particulars; such was that grant of the Earth to the Sons of Men, whom afterward God divided into several Nations, to whom by his Providence, suited to his Decrees, he set out the bounds of their several Habitations, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 26. and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 8. The like was, that first Charter made of <hi>Canaan</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was afterwards particularly design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by <hi>Lot,</hi> to the several Tribes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whose Right was yet all indefinitely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and intended in that first grant to <hi>Abraham.</hi> So accordingly all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in this promise are general, and indistinct; and to be taken in an indefinite and comprehensive way.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As first, where he saith, <hi>He will Build his Church,</hi> it is hard to know how to limit it, for he means all sorts of Churches: he means the Mystical Church, for he saith, <hi>The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it,</hi> wwhich is only true thereof; for they have prevailed against particular Churches, and may: And yet again he must include particular Churches too, for it is certain that the Mystical general Church, hath not the power and exercise of all the keys; but only as divided into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, or if it might be supposed to have the keys of Rule in General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, yet not of the Sacraments, not of Preaching the word; for, as for such Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that Church cannot meet, and therefore exerciseth them only in several parts, and divisions of it self.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those words <hi>the keys,</hi> are a general comprehensive expression, answerable to that of the word <hi>Church,</hi> taking in keys of all sorts; <hi>viz.</hi> the keys whereby the Universal Church, as such, is Built and Reared, that is, those means whereby Men are Converted, and made Members thereof; which God oftentimes blesseth in the Hands of others than Ministers. And they are therefore called <hi>the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> at large, not the keys of the Church, as restraining it to a political Church; and therefore (as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> though to a wrong purpose, urged, namely for the Transcendency of the Pope's power above the Church, yet for the thing it self right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly) is larger than that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. It is there meant of a Church political, but the keys here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. have relation to the opening the Door of Faith, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 27. it is called, and therefore implies all means of conversion. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the opposite thereunto is <hi>the Gates of Hell, which shall not prevail:</hi> And yet again on the other side, the keys or the power that is given to particular Churches
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:154381:26"/> are intended, for this is the general grant, afterwards setled in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. where, <hi>go tell the Church</hi> is mentioned. And the binding and loosing spoken of there, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the binding and loosing, which is spoken of here. So as Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of all sorts, and keys of all sorts, keys given to Churches in a way of Discipline, and to private Persons to build up one another, keys given to Officers of all sorts, Apostles and others, are all here intended. And therefore <hi>Melancton</hi> well saith, <hi>Claves Ecclesiae datae sunt, sed juxta electionem a christo institutam.</hi> And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. He instituteth a Church power, as touching the Persons to whom it belongs, distinct from <hi>Peter's,</hi> and that of the Apostles as such; and yet whatsoever Church-power there mentioned was to be in any, <hi>Peter</hi> receiveth it here. And as when we say all Civil power is in a Kingdom, it is meant, <hi>sensu diviso,</hi> the King hath one part, the Nobles another, the People another; and the several Officers of a Kingdom, they have their part; and so it is here, and all at the first was now given unto <hi>Peter,</hi> as bearing the Person of all these.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whereas the Controversie hath been, whether <hi>Peter</hi> Represented the Apostles and the Ministers only; or whether he Represented the Church also, or whether <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is here personally to be taken, as the sole and single Subject of a personal privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? We say all these are here intended by Christ, in this his first promise, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it himself in this indefinite way, which was afterwards to be further and more distinctly divided, and set out by himself and his Apostles: So that whether <hi>Peter</hi> had it granted to him as an Apostle, and as an Apostle representing Apostles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ministers, we will not contend; but yet that <hi>Peter</hi> had it also Representing the Church it self, and Saints built upon the Rock, the Arguments are as convincing and concluding to prove it, if not more than those that on the other side are framed to prove, the words should be spoken of him as an Apostle, Representing the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Elders, and therefore we safely take in all. The main Argument urged to prove that it is spoken to him as an Apostle, is drawn from this, that the Person spoken unto, <hi>viz. Peter,</hi> was an Apostle, and the other Apostles were present, and so intended; and therefore his Grant here, should be Restrained to <hi>Peter,</hi> and them as such. And the Arguments for the other, Namely, that ordinary Believers also should be intended, is taken from the occasion and ground of Christ's Speech, which was a confession of Faith made by <hi>Peter,</hi> and therefore that Christ should take in, and intend other ordinary Believers and Confessors, to have an interest in the keys, as well as Elders and Apostles, and accordingly to have been by <hi>Peter</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented. So as the pleas of this Suit, (so far as concerns this place) do lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the sort of Persons spoken to, and that were present; and the qualification of that Person, as a Believer, namely, and the ground of Christ's Speech. And all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that are brought to prove, they were given him as an Apostle, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive, that they are not given him also as a Believer. <hi>Austin's</hi> Expression, <hi>non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Petro, sed Ecclesiae,</hi> not to <hi>Peter,</hi> (that is, as an Apostle) only, but <hi>also to the Church,</hi> doth rightly divide the share between both.</p>
                  <p>The occasion of the promise, was <hi>Peter's</hi> confessing that <hi>Christ was the Son of God,</hi> which holds forth nothing proper unto Ministers only, or himself as an Apostle on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and therefore the priviledge here, must be common unto that sort, that make confession of Faith, as well as to Ministers. It was a common Faith confest, not of what belonged unto Apostles only, but unto Believers; The promise is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore suited unto the occasion. And this is a stronger inference, than that other, which is brought, that he Represented the other Apostles only, namely, because that they were present, when as <hi>Peter</hi> here did not intend to speak it in their Names, as in <hi>John</hi> 6. 69. he did; but rather he steps out and prevented them, and therefore also Christ speaks first unto him, in his personal condition, <hi>Blessed art thou Simon,</hi> Bar-Jonas; and then in his Representative condition, as representing those whose Faith he had confessed, as well as the Apostles, whom if only or simply, Christ had intended that he should represent, he might have spoken to them all, as well as to <hi>Peter,</hi> they being then present.</p>
                  <p>And then again, his Name <hi>Petros, Peter,</hi> which Christ here anew gives him with the Reason of it, <hi>viz. upon the Rock,</hi> &amp;c. in an Allusion to <hi>Petra,</hi> signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one built on the Rock, and so of the same nature with the Rock, argues this to have been Christ's Scope, in promising to him the keys. This change of his Name thus into <hi>Peter,</hi> Elegantly served to suit and answer the thing which Christ
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154381:27"/> was speaking, Namely, the Building his Church on the Rock, whereon <hi>Peter</hi> (thus confessing himself) was built. <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, that is, <hi>Thou art built on this Rock,</hi> thou art a stone in this Rock, and unto thee as such I speak. And further, he doth not say, <hi>Thou shalt be called</hi> Peter, but <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, that is, Thou art a stone, thou art built on a Rock; and thus it answereth to his being a Believer, which is all one as to be a Member of the Church so built, and therefore it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>Peter,</hi> considered in the Person of Believers built with the rest of the Church upon the Rock, as well as the Apostles, whose priviledge alone this was not, and it is farther observable, that of all the Apostles, this <hi>Peter,</hi> here spoken to, should, as if only intended alone, use this very similitude, to this particular purpose, and in effect, apply what is said here of himself, <hi>[Thou art</hi> Peter] to all Believers in 1 Pet. 2. 5. <hi>Ye also as lively stones, are built up a Spiritual House,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had said, It is not I only that am the <hi>Peter,</hi> that Christ intended, it was not spoken to me, but unto you all. And his expression in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. is all one with this in his first, <hi>To all that have received like precious Faith with us, i. e.</hi> with me; as in 1 John 9. <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>that receiveth not us,</hi> that is, that receiveth not me: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Divines of all sides do thus far yield this, they say the keys are given pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily to the Faithful, only they explain it, and say, they are given <hi>in bonum Ecclesiae, for the good of the Church,</hi> but unto the Officers of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1, If it be said, that if they be given to <hi>Peter</hi> as a Believer, then unto all Believers, to Women and Children, and the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Answer is, First, when it is said the keys are given to a Believer, it is to be understood not <hi>Reduplicativè,</hi> as if only, and to all such, all sorts of the keys are given but <hi>Extensivè,</hi> that is, to <hi>Peter,</hi> as Representing Believers also, and not barely as an Apostle; but yet such Believers as after should be more specially determined to have their share in them. For they are given unto Believers, in <hi>Peter,</hi> Representing such, according to Christ's Disposement, after to be declared; it is an indefinite Charter to be formed up by him afterwards, only now declaring that those, of that sort, should have them. And Christ hath afterwards made a peculiar excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Women not to <hi>speak,</hi> nor to usurp Authority in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. which being an Exception, it must be from a Rule, and so <hi>firmat regulam,</hi> argues and confirms that the Rule is, that <hi>Males</hi> have liberty and power to speak and judge in some Cases. And yet Secondly, even they have a sprinkling of the keys in their proportion, if you take keys in that large Sense before explained, for the keys of Conversion and Edification, may be through God's blessing in their Hands: Their Speeches and Instructions in private may, and often do Convert and Edifie the Souls of others. Thus Tit. 2. 4. <hi>That the Aged Women may Teach,</hi> (namely, by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate instructions, and the like) <hi>the younger Women to be Sober, to love their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands:</hi> And other of them may be Instruments to Convert or Build up, Servants and Children, Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their Families; yea, their <hi>Husbands may be won with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the word, by their chast Conversion,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 2. Yea, and as Members of a Church, they have power to bind sin upon a Man, in private personal Admonition; first, which is a Degree, and in order to that publick, if a Man Repents not; which yet personal Admonitions of others to those, not in Church-fellowship, (as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> formerly) are not in order unto. For when a Woman doth tell a Man of his sin, if she makes it out and prove it, she tells it him with this bond upon him, that if he repent not, she bringeth it to the Church; and so she binds him before, and in the Church, which she doth as a fellow Member, though not as a Judge: And the same Sentence that a Woman hath thus pronounced in private against him, the same the Chuach afterward Ratifies, even as what the Church Ratifies, is bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The mistake of the Objection lies in this, to infer that, because Women have not the Authority, the publick power of the keys; that therefore they have no pow-of the keys committed to them, whereas none hath all that others have, not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. If further it be Objected, that the keys are given to others than Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as to Ministers, though not true Believers.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:154381:27"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Answer is; yet so as that they are visibly Believers, or they ought not to be Ministers; so <hi>Judas</hi> was. And so if it be given to Ministers only, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, it is supposed that they are Faithful, <hi>The things that thou hast heard, commit to Faithful Men, that they may teach others,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 2. <hi>Just, Sober, Holy,</hi> Tit. 1. 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. And if it be said further, That then they are given to Believers singly, and out of Church-fellowship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Answer is; Although they are here given to Believers materially, yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally but as built up in a Church, according as Christ should after order it. And if we speak of the Judiciary Power, Elders themselves must needs be supposed to be set over a Church, ere those keys are given unto them; and so also what is gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Saints hereof, those keys must needs fall under the same supposition. But if we speak of the keys in a larger Sense, so they are given to all, and every one singly, whether they be in Church-fellowship or no. Now Christ's grant here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing general and indefinite, though it takes in all, yet each according to Christs or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and so if the Judiciary keys are said to be intended, they must be understood to be here given, as Christ afterwards should particularly design, how they should be exercised, and that is, and can be only in Church Society; and whether by Saints or Elders only, as they are rightly form'd up into fixed Bodies.</p>
                  <p>But for a conclusion, that which from this place we take along with us, towards the finding out the Seat or Subject of Church-power, is this; That the keys were indefinitely and materially here given, as well to Saints, as Elders, in the Person of <hi>Peter,</hi> in their several proportion, and afterwards were particularly determined, and held forth in the Rules and Examples set by the Apostles.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>That before a company of Believers or Saints, can become the Formal Seat of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they must be united into the state, and order of a Church. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons given why this is necessary. A Demonstration of it also from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Primitive Churches, planted by the Apostles.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THis first Charter or Grant of the keys both to the Saints and Officers, being but indefinite, and given unto them but as materially considered, as the command and blessing to multiply, is to Men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. Ere these can become the Formal Seat of Government, or Publick Worship, there must be an orderly moulding and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this matter, both Saints and Officers, into several Bodies or Societies, for the exercise of these keys; which both the necessity of the thing requires, and also the examples in the New Testament do warrant and confirm unto us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The necessity of the thing requires it.</p>
                  <p>For first, otherwise there would be no Order, which in the Church of the <hi>Colossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the Apostle doth so praise in them. He might have commended the Saints in that City, for their Personal Holiness, the Teachers among them for their Gifts; but he further rejoyceth in their Order. And as Order in any Multitude or Company of Men, primarily respects their Union into a Body, for such ends and purposes among themselves, as thereby they seek to attain; So here in this case, <hi>Quod non est forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, non est vere unum,</hi> what is not formed, is not truly one: This outward Order is as the Form that gives the Unity. An heap of Stones is not one Body, so proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as an House, although the parts in such a heap be Homogenial, and of one and, the same kind; and the other consists of several materials, Hetrogenial, and of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds, as Wood, Stone, Iron, Clay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, and the indefinite Collection of all such Materials into one heap, are not a Building, although they be Squared, and fitted to be joyned each to other; the Beams and Rafters by their Tenants and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesses, and the like: But that all these should be Reared, and Artificially erected into one Building; it is that, which makes them one Body, in such a respect as the other are not.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:154381:28"/> 2. Secondly, There would otherwise be no Government at all. When God gave forth <hi>that Law,</hi> Gen. 9. 6. <hi>he that sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed;</hi> over and above this indefinite Commission given, it was necessary for the due and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly execution hereof; that there should be Orderly Societies of Men, which should be the Seat of a Government, by which this punishment should be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. God's way in this Law, and so Christ's meaning in that Gift of the keys, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. cannot be like to that which <hi>Cain,</hi> through the Horrour of his Conscience feared, that any Man, or every Man that met him next, might kill him. So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it indefinitely and promiscuously in the power of any, the next company of Saints and Elders to judge an offending Brother. And Reason confirms this. For 1. It is this Form and orderly Union of them into a Body, that makes any company the Seat of Government, and to have a power among them; and how can there be true Government, without a Seat of Jurisdiction, in which it must be exercised? And that must be a Body politick, according to the nature or kind of the Government, or politick exercised in it; if Civil, then 'tis a Common-wealth or Corporation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if Ecclesiastical, it is a Church. A politick Body is not made up by a Multitude; for then a company of Men at a Horse-Race were such. Nor is it Local Union in the same place, for so at a Stage-play, a throng or a croud meeting, would be such.</p>
                  <p>As Forms in Natural Bodies, are necessary to constitute them such, as well as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; so an Union and Moulding into one, is needful to constitute a Body politick. Yea, a judicial power doth as much depend upon a Formality of Order, as it doth upon a Material qualification of Persons. Take a company of Ministers, or what sort of Persons else, however qualified or denominated, they have not that power (which yet doth belong to Ministers) indefinitely, or as any way met; but as Formed up into Bodies, as a power in a Kingdom is not given to Justices of Peace indefinitely, or promiscuously met; but as met according to Commission in several Circuits, and distinct Bodies from them. Burgesses of Parliament, although law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully chosen to be such, yet they have not Parliamentary power, but as met in Parliament, according to the Law of the Kingdom; and the Legality of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth give us as much Power and Authority, as the qualification of the Persons. The Authority is the Result of Union, and that legally and lawfully made, as well as it is founded in Persons fitly qualified. Power in Civil things, is not so much given to Mayors and Aldermen, as to the Corporation, though the whole Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration exerciseth it not; yet it is this priviledge, and they have such and such a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er amongst them, it is not alone the priviledge of the Magistrates so much: That Heathenish Town-Clark of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> when the Men of that City met in in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous way: (And perhaps the very same Men of that City, had panegyrical meetings for some Acts of Government, as Election of Magistrates, and the like; yet) because then they met not according to the Order of that City, he says of it, that it was an illegal <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Assembly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Without this Union, and Order of Society, Persons offended, that ought to complain, should not have whither to go to accuse; nor the party offended be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to come. Nor would it be known, whose the Care and Duty were, to take on them the cognizance, and judging of it; and whose the sin was, if it were neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If these companies of Elders and Saints in a great City, were fluid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous; and but like such companies as met at sights, or shews, or Ordinances without any Incorporation or Imbodying, so as, all being in an equal liberty, to go one day to this, another to that company, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the same Persons never met in one place, unless casually, and providentially; if twelve such Meetings were in one such City, what shall oblige me to any one, more than the rest? If I come to receive in any one; and they upon occasion would proceed judicially to deal with me, I might plead and say, I am no more accountable to you, than the rest; I receive as often with them, as with you, I belong as much to other Assemblies, as to you; and what have you to do to judge me, more than they? And besides it being (in this way) but providential, that the same Persons, the offender is accused unto to day, should meet in one place another day, when all have an indifferent liberty, without any set or fixed Incorporation; at the utmost it is but his forbearing, to Assemble with the company for that time, or in that place any more, and retire unto those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he is at his freedom so to do.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:154381:28"/>
                  <p> Again in this case; all, that any of those companies can inflict upon him, is but for that time to suspend him from Communion with them; but to proceed to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication they cannot, not only because that imports a fixed company, he is cast out of; but also because there is nothing to oblige him to attend that company, to be so often Admonished, as his sin shall become an obstinacy, and fit matter for Excommunication. Or what shall oblige those of this individual company, to whom the complaint first came, that they in relation to, and for his Censure's sake, should meet so often rogether, as that he may be publickly Admonished by them, so many times as in the end deservedly to be thrown out?</p>
                  <p>Yea, 3. This Union and Order, must needs hold in such Societies, where the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry punishment is to cast out of that Body, they were first within; for to cast out, and to be within, are Correspondent, and answer each to other. Now the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be exercised, is not only a personal withdrawing by every Man apart, (as occasionally they should meet him) by a Sentence publickly agreed on; but the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, then in use in the Primitive Churches, was to cast out of the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>John</hi> 10. (as to Expel, and cast out of a City or Town, or Family) which unless they were a Body formed up among themselves, and he one within to them, they could not do.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. As the necessity of the thing, so the Examples of those Primitive Churches, argues them to have been formed and fixed Bodies, that were the Seat of Worship and Government, and do agree with these forementioned principles.</p>
                  <p>First, The very Denomination of Churches, (as of Churches in <hi>Judea, Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> &amp;c.) doth fall in with, and confirm that first Reason, that the Saints and Elders in those Countries were cast into distinct and several Bodies; and diversifyed by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Corporations and Relations. It imports not a Distinction of them, only as Saints materially from the World, (as the Universal Church, whereof they are parts, doth) but a Distinction of them into several companies among themselves; Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Universal and Great Church, parted into several lesser companies and Churches. Nor can those set and fixed Titles, arise from several Promiscuous Acts of meeting of these Saints and Elders providentially; but it inclines, in the Holy Ghost's Language, a setled State, and Incorporation, in order to setled Meetings; as the word Presbytery notes out, not simply a company of Elders, but united into a Body for Government; so the Phrase <hi>Churches</hi> imports, not simply a company of Saints and Elders met, but a stated Society: So as when the Union of their actual meeting is dissolved, they still continue the same; as the Companies in <hi>London</hi> are still so many Companies in State, though not in Act, when every Man is gone to his own House, as well as when met in their Common Hall. They are not only a Body because, or when they actually meet, but they are a Body in order to meeting; and there is a power in their Governours, to call them together again. And this also all the Comparisons of an House to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of particular Churches) implies, not simply acts of meeting, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted State.</p>
                  <p>And that the Churches then in the Primitive Times of Christianity, were such Bodies is evident: For 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. the Apostle calls not only a particular Church, an whole Church, (as likewise elsewhere, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> is called the <hi>whole Flock;</hi> and that at <hi>Corinth, a whole lamp;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. each therefore <note place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>in</hi> Acts 20. <hi>yet 'tis so elsewhere in other places.</hi>
                     </note> making a Distinct Body, an whole and entire Body, bounded within it self, as any other Corporation is) but further, he speaks of that Church, as importing a stated Union, in relation to meeting actually, <hi>if the whole Church,</hi> (says he, <hi>ver.</hi> 23.) <hi>come together.</hi> They were therefore a Church in order to meeting, even when they met not, and are at home, in respect that the Union and Bond to the same Laws and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, still remained. They were not a Church simply, because they met, or when they met; but they, the same Persons were to meet, because they were a Church in a stated and constant Relation. And suitably to this, he elsewhere says of them; <hi>when you are gathered together, to cast out such an one,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were to meet as a Body, in a constant way. And upon this fixed Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of each, unto the whole, the Apostle lays, upon this same Church, this as a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as to meet for Worship, so to stay each for other, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 33. and so not to meet in promiscuous several companies, (as Men at Ordinaries) for the Sacrament:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:154381:29"/> There was therefore a Set Company, known to each other, obliged to meet in one, in a constant way, and so was an whole Church, in a fixed Relation.</p>
                  <p>And such were all the Churches the Apostles wrote unto, and gave Ordinances forth unto; <hi>So I ordain in all the Churches,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 17. <hi>we have no such Custom,</hi> (saith he, 1 Cor. 11. 16.) <hi>nor the Churches of Christ:</hi> Whom he praiseth for, <hi>keeping the Traditions he gave them,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 11. 2. and rejoyceth in their Order, and whom he blameth for occasion of Divisions, in respect of their publick <hi>MEETINGS,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 18. 17. 21, 22. Now all this argues, that as Churches, these were Bodies and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, in a fixt and setled Relation; For his manner of writing is parallel with that, as if a King or his Superior Officers, should write in his Name to all Corporations, Shires, and Bodies politick, giving out Laws and Proclamations, and edicts to be observed by them in their Assemblies; which if they were not fixed and setled Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but only unfixt and uncertain fluid Assemblies, they were not meet Subjects, capable thereof, nor of Orders to Regulate them. This also the State of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> whom Christ directeth those seven Epistles unto, with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inscriptions to the several Angels of those Churches, it evidently argues, they were fixed Bodies, having each their Elders an Angel, Collectively taken as the use of that Phrase in that Book is) in a special relation; to whom therefore, as to the Mayor or Aldermen in a setled Corporation, the Letters are directed. And he blames them, as Bodies or Societies of Men fixedly incorporate, for sins passed in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Transactions, as they were a Body; as suffering <hi>Jezabel</hi> to Teach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he threatneth to remove the Candlestick, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. that is, their Church-State, as they were a standing Seat and Subject, of the Ordinances of the Gospel; as the <hi>Jewish</hi> Condlestick was. For the seven Candlesticks, are the seven Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 20. As these Candlesticks were these Churches, distinguished each from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so these Churches were the Saints and Elders, as Candlesticks cast, and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into a set and standing Form; and so thereby made distinct each from other, though all made out of the same lump of the Church Universal; therefore chosen out as standing patterns of the Frame, and Fabrick of other Churches then extant, or to come. And as that and the like threatning, concerns Succession, so it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argues a fixed Combination, that is the Subject of Guilt; for that Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continuing, though the Persons then alive, should all die: Yet if the same sins continued in Persons that succeed Members of that Combination, that Church or Body, in respect of the fixed State of it continuing, would inherit it. For by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of such a fixed Union, or stated Society or Corporation, it comes to pass, that not only a company of Men are one Body, when their Assemblings or Meetings are not, though in order to such Meetings, as well as when they are; but farther, that they continue the same Body to Succession, and so each of these the same Church or Candlestick, notwithstanding it may suffer alteration in encrease or lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in respect of particular Persons. Yea, though the Matter, the Gold, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that now make up one of these Candlesticks, should all be removed by Death, or otherwise yet the Candlestick continued the same, because the same setled Church-State continued; as in this respect, the Company of <hi>Mercers,</hi> or any Corporation, is the same it was an Hundred years ago, because of this setled Order and Union; and is capable of being threatned to have their Charter taken away, their Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion removed, or the main priviledges of it some way nullified, though the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Persons do not still dwell in the same City.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as in respect of publick Worship, so in respect of Judicature; the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es then were Bodies cast into fixed Relations. This made the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. 'tis called) a Seat and Subject of Judicature and Government, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. Do not ye Judge them that are within? And what have I to do to Judge them that are without? Here was first a Set and certain Judicature among themselves, as the word Judging imports: Secondly, a Body within which who ever was, he came under this Judicature. For they Judged them within, as Corporations or Bodies politick, use to do them within themselves. There was something then that made a special Relation, which was the ground of their power to Judge this Person; and brought him within the compass of their Jurisdiction. And it is further expressed with a denial of power, over others that are without; <hi>What have I to do to Judge them that are without?</hi> I that am an Apostle, that have the largest Jurisdiction and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154381:29"/> Commission, what have I to do in it? And his power and theirs did differ; for though he might Judge as occasion was, in any Church where he came; yet he lays it as a special peculiar Duty upon them, to have power over them that were within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and that power belonged unto them, as the other belonged unto him. And the Persons that are said to be <hi>within,</hi> to that Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to whom he writes, could not be the Church Universal; for then the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> should have had power to have judged all or any other Churches of Saints in the World, as well as it self, and so a part had power over the whole. There was thirdly a duty lay upon some Persons among them, to whom this belonged, <hi>Do not ye judge</hi> and a sin that lay upon them for their neglect, which lay not upon another company <hi>Do not ye judge them within?</hi> And have you hitherto neglected it?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The special relation of Elders to their Churches, and the Members in particular Churches among themselves, doth evidence, that not any company of Christians, but such as embodied together into, and setled in the Order of a Church, are the Subject and Seat of this Grand Charter of the keys, or the Ecclesiastical power.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Relation of the Members among themselves, doth evidence it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. where he descends from the Discourse of Union of the Members, in the Universal Body of Christ, which he calls Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. to a more particular en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of the Duties of that special Relation, that was amongst the Members of that Church, as a particular Body to Christ; and so to oblige each to other, not only by that general Law of the Universal Relation; but further by vertue of a more special one, contracted among themselves, being made a distinct and entire Body to Christ in particular, by being one Church. And so the Obligation was not only doubled upon them, but further the proportion of the general Tye, (which was more diffused) was contracted into a narrow and lesser compass; and as hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing analogy with it, was so made stronger and more vigorous. Thus we understand those words to be a special Application of that general Doctrine promised in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the Chapter, which Treats of Christ's Body, the Church Universal: <hi>Now ye,</hi> the Church of <hi>Corinth, are the Body of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Members in particular,</hi> in a more special Relation; and so owe all those Duties in a special manner, one to another. In this respect also, sometimes when the Apostle hath occasion to mention a Member of a particular Church, he specifies it with a special distinctive Relation, Epaphras, <hi>who is one of you,</hi> Colos. 4. 12. And Rom. 16. 1. Phebe <hi>our Sister, who is a Servant of the Church, which is at</hi> Cenchrea, is commended to Communion with them, as standing in special relation to that Church. So when he speaks of Elders, a special relation to a particular Church is intimated, which could not be, unless those Churches had been fixed Bodies for State; and not Promiscuous Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, in respect of acts of meeting. Thus the same <hi>Epaphras,</hi> as to his common relation of Membership, in that Church of <hi>Colossians</hi> is mentioned, <hi>who is one of you,</hi> as afore, <hi>chap.</hi> 4 12. and also as to his more special relation, as an Officer of that Church, <hi>who is for you a Faithful Minister,</hi> of whom they had been taught the Gospel, <hi>as ye also learned of</hi> Epaphras, <hi>who is for you a Faithful Minister;</hi> and in a special relation your Minister. He still held his relation of a Minister for them, though for the present occasionally implyed with <hi>Paul.</hi> Thus the Ordinary Elders were set over particular Churches, and so had a special relation to those Churches, as Elders of them; and the Relation was the Rise and Foundation of their call to be Elders: As <hi>Acts</hi> 14 23. The Apostles who were general Elders in all Churches, by vertue of Apostolical Commission, Ordained ordinary Elders in every Church; and these Elders were specially appropriated <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>to them,</hi> and were to take care of that whole Flock, which appertained to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. and so they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with the care of them, and to watch over them, as those that were to give an <hi>account to God for their Souls;</hi> and therefore they were their peculiar charge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And in respect of this Relation, the Holy Ghost directs those Epistles men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Rev. ch.</hi> 2. 2, 3. to the several particular Angels of those Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> who therefore had their Churches assigned to them; for which they were to give an account, and more accountable for their sins in which they are accordingly blamed.</p>
                  <p>And these Elders could not have a special setled relation, if these Churches were not cast into a fixt setled State, as Churches under them; for the one, are relations
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:154381:30"/> to the other; and therefore the Holy Ghost directs his Epistles to the Churches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. as well as to the Angels of these Churches, for in their relations, these two were Commensurable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And Lastly, These Elders and these Churches, were formed up into fixt and setled Presbyteries, so 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And the Acts of Ordination, were not Attributed simply to an indefinite company of Elders, (as promiscuously, or any way met) but to a Presbytery, which imports not simply an Act of meeting, by a company of Elders; but (as the word is Paraphrased by our Translators, with respect to the Jewish <hi>Synedrim) the Estate of Elders,</hi> Act. 19. 5. As if we should say, the Common-Council did ordain so and so, it notes not out simply, a meeting of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Wise Men in such a City, but as met in an united Body. And if these Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were a fixed and united company of Elders, then the Churches must needs be also, to whom they were a Presbytery. And so this is a further Argument than that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which was drawn from the special relation of Elders, singly or personally, or loosly taken; which was ordinarily fixed, to be a setled Church. But if further, we consider these Elders, as united into a Presbytery, it yet more importeth this. For though it should be granted to be a Truth, which some affirm, that every Elder, were an Elder indefinitely of the Church Universal; yet every Presbytery, is not a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery to the whole Universal, (no more than every Common-Council in each Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, is a Common-Council for the Kingdom; though each Burgess met therein must be capable of being a Burgess in Parliament for the whole Kingdom;) but as specificated, such must relate only to some particular Church. If therefore the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were seated, as our Brethren would have it) in Presbyteries, yet these Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies must be fixed and incorporated: Or if in Churches with their Elders, (or else no where) yet if their Elders were Presbyteries to their several Churches, (as is evident they must be) then those Churches also were fixed Bodies, over which they were placed. Yea, and the Scripture doth in <hi>Terminis,</hi> in plain Terms, Attribute the Act of Ordination to a Presbytery; that is, a company of Elders united in their Relation, and in that Action; and as much to this their united relation, as to their being Elders. And so the validity and legality of the Act, depends as much upon this, as upon their being Elders met; as if a Man should say, such a thing was done by the Common-Council, certainly he means thereby, that it was done not only by Men that are Councellors promiscuously in that sense, as Lawyers are called to give counsel, as occasion is singly or apart; but it imports, they met as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council so imbodyed, that the Act hath a Legality, an Authority therefrom. And the Validity as much depends upon that incorporation of theirs, according to a Law, as upon their being Men, and so qualified.</p>

                        <hi>That Christ in his Institution of Ecclesiastical power,</hi> Matth. 18. <hi>hath granted this power of the Keys, only to Saints embodied; and united in the State and Order of a Congregational Church.

                     <q>Moreover, if thy Brother shall Trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and him alone: If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy Brother. But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the Mouth of two or three Witnesses, every word may be Established. And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church: But if he neglect to hear the Church, let him be unto thee, as an Heathen Man, and a Publican. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven: And whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven. Again, I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree on Earth, as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father, which is in Heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, there am I in the midst of them.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THere are three things may be proved out of this place. The first is that Church-power, is by Christ's Institution. Secondly, That a particular Congregation is there meant, and so we have an Institution for it. Then Thirdly, That suppose there were a Subordination of Churches, above particular Churches, that yet the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church should finally Excommunicate; and that the supposed Superior Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Presbyteries, should not take it out of their Hands.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first is plain, that here is an Institution of Church-power, as is evident by comparing it with, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18, 19. where it is said, <hi>I will Build my Church, and I will give thee the Keys.</hi> He speaks indefinitely. That place affordeth this Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that Christ is the only Builder of his Church, <hi>(Every House is Built by some one,</hi> Heb. 3. 4.) and of all things about the House; <hi>The Builder of all things is God,</hi> (saith he) Namely Christ, who is God, as he had proved in <hi>chap.</hi> 2. having spoken this indefinitely in, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18, 19. here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, 16. he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly determines the Seat, and Subject of this Ecclesiastical power. Here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. Christ uttereth himself definitely, <hi>Tell the Church.</hi> The <hi>Jus proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16 19. the Right of propriety is stated in the Right of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration. The <hi>Jus Executionis,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 16. He doth not give it to Saints and Officers simply, but as formed up into Bodies. <hi>Matth▪</hi> 16. Holdeth forth, that they are to be Saints, making Confession as <hi>Peter</hi> did; there is the matter of a Church, to whom the keys is given, but <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. holdeth forth, how that these Saints are to be formed up into several Bodies or Churches, and so to execute this power. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he speaks of them, as being <hi>gathered together in his Name,</hi> Mat. 18. 20. Their being Saints, or Faithful, is not enough; but Order is to be added to Faith, (as in <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 5. which Order is held forth here, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 15. to 20.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The words of Christ here in Matth. 18. 18. <hi>Verily I say unto you,</hi> which are institutive; and again I say unto you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That word <hi>Amen,</hi> or <hi>verily, Est idem quod firmum &amp; ratum,</hi> shews <hi>the thing to be firm and ratified,</hi> as <hi>Amen</hi> doth also; but set to our Prayers. And here so it is taken, for it is with a promise of power from him, confirming and ratifying of such meetings as he speaks of. And a promise to any thing that is beyond the Law of Nature, implies an Institution: For what is an Institution? But a setting up some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with promise, to have a Blessing in it beyond the Efficacy of the thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Again I say unto you,</hi> saith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. The word again is <hi>Additionis, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> a Superadded Expression, as Matth. 4. 7. <hi>again it is written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:154381:31"/> 3. The words, <hi>I say,</hi> are institutive; or commanding with an Efficacy. As they are used in <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 24. <hi>I say unto thee arise.</hi> And if they be only Assertory, (as some say, they are) yet being spoken by the Son, of his own House, in his Mouth, they are Edificatory, or Institutive of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Jesus Christ giveth power to a Brother to Admonish; and that in an orderly way, in order to Excommunication. Then bids him take two or three, and then tell the Church. And it is not a matter of indulgency or liberty, or priviledge, (as <hi>Cameron</hi> observeth) that his Speech importeth, for that is, when as there is a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to ones self by it, which if I will forego, I may; but what is spoken here is, <hi>per modum Imperij, by way of command,</hi> for it is for the gaining of a Brother. And it is in order also to a Court-Sentence, when it is brought to the Church, And the word, <hi>Established,</hi> Matth. 18. 16. that is, <hi>the Sentence shall be firm, and fixed, or ratified,</hi> confirms this to be his design and meaning.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. To reckon a Brother as an Heathen, if obstinate after this course is taken with him, is an Act of power; which if Christ had not given, should not have absolutely necessitated it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He saith, <hi>where two or three are gathered in my Name,</hi> therefore it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. What makes other things an Ordinance; but that they are done in the Name and Power of Christ? Is Baptizing in his Name, an Ordinance; and so gathering together in his Name also? And in his Name is all one, as in his Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by Commission from him; and to such ends and purposes, as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, whereof one is to throw out an offending Brother. He speaks as the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah,</hi> that did anew form his Church, and put a new Title upon their gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; calls it <hi>Assembled in my Name,</hi> as the <hi>Messiah</hi> is come in the Flesh; And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he did Authorize the whole Nation, and made the Trust unto them, he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth it now to a fewer company, to two or three gathered together in his Name. All Assemblies, if they be not Established by Authority, are unlawful, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 39. Therefore these Assemblies that Christ here speaks of, must be Established by the Law of Christ.</p>
                  <p>And thus much may suffice to shew in general, that let it be meant in Church-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, what ever it is, it is by Institution.</p>
                  <p>And when he saith, Go tell the Church, he imports Authority and Power, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that company he calls a Church, with which he invests them. The word <hi>Church</hi> in this, is an Authoritative Word; and the Authority, the Church hath, is his, and whom should she have it from, but from him? And therefore in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. They are <hi>said to be gathered together in his Name, and in his Power.</hi> And by comparing this place and that together, it appears, that his intent is both institutive and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective, only with this difference, that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. Jesus Christ speaks by way of directing a Brother what to do, when he is offended; and upon that occasion, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions what Authority he would give unto his Church, and <hi>Assemblies of his Saints gathered together in his Name; But in the</hi> other Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Paul</hi> gives forth the direction to the Church it self, calling upon them to perform their Duty, according to the Power and Authority given them by Christ. As an Apostle, he commands them when gathered together, to deliver such an one unto Satan, and (saith he) <hi>do ye not judge them that are within?</hi> That is, have ye not power to do it from Christ, is it not a Duty lies upon you? And he Parallels it with that power himself, had according to proportion. Now the power he had all, I grant to be Institutive, for otherwise, what power could one Man assume over the Churches of Christ? And so likewise without the like Institution, what power could a Church assume to deliver a Man to Satan, which is out of their Natural and Moral power to do?</p>
                  <p>I shall now Demonstrate, that a particular Congregation is meant in this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and that a particular Congregation is there Instituted, and Instituted too, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that power of Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>Now that a particular Congregation is here meant, is proved first out of the place. The Church intended here, is a Church appointed for Worship, as well as for Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Not only because that meeting to Pray. is mentioned as well as to correct Offences; but because if that be a Church which is appointed for Worship, it were strange if Christ should in his first Institution, mention that Church which is only for Discipline, and not that which is for Worship also. 2. Out of Presbyterian Principles.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:154381:31"/>
                  <p> And 1. Out of the place it is apparent, that a particular Congregation is meant, take <hi>Church</hi> to be interpreted by whatsoever you will, that Christ alluded to them in use.</p>
                  <p>There were many unformed Sects, that had several companies belonging to them, that were of the same Principles and Regular Order; who although they held a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Communion with the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet the manner of these Sects, was to have their Synagogues and Schools, (as <hi>Paul</hi> was brought up at the feet of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel;</hi> and we read of the School of <hi>Tyrannus.)</hi> And if any of them Transgressed the Principles of their Order and Sect, they were brought (as <hi>Grotius</hi> saith) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole; and so they were reproved, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is. <hi>before all.</hi> And now if this Allusion be to such a Church or Company, then the People are taken in, such as should meet and hear; and so then, Jesus Christ so fixed his Institution, as the People as well as the Officers met, for even those Sects, supposed Guides, who did bring it to the whole company of that Sect, whereto a Man belonged Secondly, if the Allusion were to this, then according to the liberty that was then given, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Disciples, our Saviour Christ had then a Church upon Earth, which he spoke actually unto. For he had by him twelve Apostles, and Disciples, who after grew unto one Hundred and twenty. And therefore according to the Law of those times, he directs them, that if any offences were among them, after two or three Witnesses taken, they should tell it to this Church. Although <hi>Judas</hi> had sinned, yet he had not so sinned, as to have Witnesses against him, until his betraying of Christ, and then (as our Saviour Christ Prophesied of him, <hi>John</hi> 15. 6.) he was cast out as a withered Branch. And then, 3. That Phrase <hi>of gathering together in my Name,</hi> is an Allusion to that custom in those times; for the manner was then, to call Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples by the Names of those they followed, and their meetings by their Names, as <hi>Herodians</hi> were so stiled, from the Name of <hi>Herod. In my Name</hi> (saith Christ) that is, such as profess me, and set up such Schools in my Name, are to observe the Rules which I set them, for their Order, and Government. Christ here expressed how his Churches should, after his Death and Ascension into Heaven, be ordered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament. As it is said, the <hi>Scripture foreseeing that God would justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the</hi> Gentiles <hi>through Faith,</hi> (Gal. 3. 8.) made the promise unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> And as God foreseeing, that when the <hi>Israelites</hi> came into <hi>Canaan,</hi> they should live in Cities, and be a Kingdom or a Nation, accordingly Ordered beforehand their Government, and gave Laws aforehand, for that Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> as such, when they should be in their own Land: So here (the Church of the New Testament, being to be multiplied and scattered, that they could not assemble in one, as that National Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> did) Christ aforehand speaks, what he would, have his Churches under the New Testament to be; and his Institutions are suited to what in his Counsels, and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he had Determined, should be; and he knew aforehand would fall out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Secondly, The Allusion be to the <hi>Jewish</hi> way, that was appointed by God, and had been of Old; then either the <hi>Synedrim</hi> is meant, or the Synagogues with the Officers there. But in the first place, the <hi>Synedrim</hi> is not meant; for (as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron</hi> saith) that is never called <hi>Ecclesia, a Church,</hi> no not by the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> But be it, that this word had been used of it, yet private offences, (of which Christ here speaks) were never brought to the <hi>Synedrim;</hi> but Christ speaks this of private offences; for it is, <hi>if he offend thee, then take two witnesses,</hi> and then tell it to the Church. Whereas there were but four Cases which belonged immediately unto the <hi>Synedrim,</hi> and those were Cases of Difficulty, when the private Judges in the Cities, could not end the controversy, who yet had full power to have done it. And then in the third place, <hi>Cameron's</hi> Reason, why the <hi>Synedrim</hi> is not meant, is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Evangelists</hi> do still call it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and that now only, Christ should call <hi>Ecclesia, a Church,</hi> when it is no where used by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Name, would be very strange. Secondly, if his Allusion be to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every Town, this makes for the way of Congregational Churches. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Village hath their Government entire within themselves, Deut. 16. 18. <hi>in all their Gates.</hi> If it were a small Town, there were three Elders, (to which Christ here Alludeth) and in the Cities one and twenty. And from the Towns to the Cities, there was not an Appeal, but immediately to the <hi>Synedrim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. His Allusion rather is unto the Synagogues in every Town, which were the Ecclesiastical State. The Books of <hi>Moses</hi> were Read in every City, in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:154381:32"/>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 21. For every City had their Synagogue, and so then in this Sense, <hi>to tell the Church,</hi> was to tell that particular Synagogue, (whereof they were Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) both to People and Rulers. Now that Christ alludeth to this appears.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because that Excommunication was exercised in their Synagogues, not in the <hi>Synedrim.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Synedrim</hi> might make a Law as a Rule, according to which Men should be Excommunicated; but the Synagogues executed it, thereof it is called, <hi>Casting out of the Synagogues,</hi> John 16. 2. And Synagogues were not govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Association, but each Synagogue had it's Rulers, <hi>John</hi> 9. 22. and in John 16. 2. <hi>They shall cast you out of the Synagogues.</hi> And a Synagogue was a particular Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, such as Congregations now, Luke 7. 5. He hath <hi>Built us a Synagogue,</hi> Mar. 1. 21. <hi>Christ entred into the Synagogue and Taught.</hi> And when a Man was cast out of the Synagogue, and would come into the Temple, they used to say to him, when he would offer to enter into the Temple, (although they refused him not to enter thither, for he held Communion still with the Temple) <hi>May he who inhabits this Temple, give thee an Heart to hearken to the words of thy Brethren, that so they may receive thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In every one of these Synagogues, there were two or three Officers. They had Rulers, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 14, 15. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 7, 17. And therefore Christ alluding unto this, saith, <hi>If two or three agree.</hi> They used to have three at least, that a Major Vote might cast it among the Rulers. And they used to have two or three Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, afore they cast out, and thirty days between every Admonition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In a manner, all other Authority was taken from them; but what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in their Synagogues thus, or in the <hi>Synedrim,</hi> which dealt only in the great matters of Blasphemy; whereas this Authority of Synagogues, was for offences of Brethren; and therefore it is still said, they should bring them into their Synagogues, when they questioned them, as <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 11. The <hi>Romans</hi> took away all other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from them. But here they could inflict punishments, <hi>They shall Scourge you in their Synagogues,</hi> it was the place of their punishment, so <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 34. they whipt in them, for they had no other Courts left, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 11. And they had Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, for the casting Men out from thence. And perhaps these meetings, in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, are those which are called <hi>Synedria,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 17. And in Luke 12. 11. <hi>when they bring you into the Synagogues,</hi> is mentioned first, and then, <hi>unto Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates and Powers,</hi> Namely, the Civil Magistrate, which in <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 17. is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thus; <hi>They will deliver you up to the Council,</hi> or <hi>Synedrim,</hi> and they will Scourge you in their Synagogues; and then follows their being brought to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistrate in the next verse, <hi>and shall bring you before Kings and Governours.</hi> And some Interpreters say, that the Allusion is here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. to that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue Government and Worship, <hi>Ecclesia</hi> and <hi>Synagogus,</hi> being used Promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. These Synagogues were <hi>Oratories,</hi> places of Prayer and Preaching, therefore Christ doth also Subjoyn here, <hi>if two meet together, to ask or to pray.</hi> It is not meant only of praying, when they Administred Discipline; for it is praying about any business, for they used to Worship and Pray in the Synagogues, as well as to cast out of the Synagogues; their Worship and their Discipline, there being of equal extent. And the word that is used in this Text, of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>shall agree,</hi> signifies a meeting, as well as a consent, so <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 3. And the words also that Christ useth, ver. 19. <hi>Again, or moreover I say unto you,</hi> (having spoken of Discipline afore, and now of Prayer) do hold forth the Scope of this Church, to be as well for Prayer, as for Discipline; and so to be understood of such a Synagogue, as was both for Discipline, and Worship, or Prayer. And then the Addition of the last words, ver. 20. <hi>For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, I am in the midst of them;</hi> is the general conclusion to both. So that the meaning is, that whether they meet for Worship or Prayer, (of which he had spoken, <hi>ver.</hi> 19.) or for Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, (of which he had spoken, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18.) Christ is in the midst of them. Now as our Saviour Christ's allusion was unto that Synagogue, Government, and Worship, then extant, so particular Churches and Congregations under the Gospel, in answer thereunto, are exprest unto us, under the word Synagogue. They have that Name, because unto them did Christ allude; and they suited his Institution un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament, <hi>Jam.</hi> 22. If one come into your Assembly, ir is in the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>into your Synagogue;</hi> He speaks of Synagogues for Worship,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:154381:32"/> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. forsake not the assembling of your selves together. It is there <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>meeting in a Synagogue,</hi> which is a particular meeting for Worship, which is therefore called <hi>the House,</hi> that God hath under the New Testament, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. whereof Christ is said to be the High Priest.</p>
                  <p>And indeed the analogy between their Synagogues and our Congregations, holdeth exceeding far. They hold two or three Officers, that were Rulers of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; and we profess for kind, that there are three sort of Officers, <hi>Pastors, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> And the <hi>Jews</hi> in a manner for the substance, use the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression concerning their Synagogues, they had two Wise Men to Teach, and one to Discern; and therefore Christ saith <hi>where two or three are gathered together.</hi> And to be an Heathen and a Publican and to be cast out of the Synagogue, was all one; and the word <hi>Synagogue</hi> and <hi>Ecclesia,</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> are all one in the Septuagint; and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be cast out of the Church, corresponds to their Ejection out of the Synagogue.</p>
                  <p>And to this hath Christ framed the constitution of his Church, under the New Testament, that it should be both for Worship and Government, as the Synagogues were within themselves. And although these Assemblies are called Synagogues as for their extent; yet they are called Temples, as for their priviledge. And this consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Christ, suited with the primitive times of the Gospel; for the <hi>Jews</hi> being Dispersed in several Nations, they had Synagogues in all Cities, and an entire Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment within those Synagogues. Yea, even in <hi>Judea,</hi> in some one great City, there was but one Synagogue, as in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> Mar. 1. 21. Thus at <hi>Antioch</hi> too, the <hi>Jews</hi> had a <hi>Synagogue,</hi> Acts 13. 14, 15. as also at <hi>Thessolanica,</hi> Acts 17. 1. and at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> Acts 18. 4. where the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> were met in one. Now the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians being to be called out of all places; and being Disperst, as these <hi>Jews</hi> were in all Nations, Christ suited a Government to these conditions of the Synagogue-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and answerably fixed his Institution of Churches, in imitation of the <hi>Jews</hi> Disperst, who had Synagogues amongst all the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in their several Cities. Christ chose not the legal way of a National Church, or of a <hi>Synedrim,</hi> or of going up to one Temple, for a whole Nation, but he fixed on Synagogues, as fitting his turn best; for he chose Churches out of <hi>Nations;</hi> and so did not hold to one National Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> and therefore we read of <hi>Churches</hi> in <hi>Judea</hi> it self, and not <hi>Church,</hi> Gal. 1. 22.</p>
                  <p>And to strengthen this assertion, it may be observed, that our Saviour Christ did not take nor follow the Institution of the Old Testament, but the Appendixes of it, as for Example; In the Lord's Supper he Instituted the Bread and Wine, answerably to the Bread and Wine which were appendixes of the Passover, and he refuseth the Paschal Lamb, and chooseth the Bread and Wine. So likewise as the <hi>Jews</hi> used to Baptize <hi>Proselites:</hi> So he refuseth Circumcision, and takes that Baptism. Thus also as the Synagogues were, as it were Chappels of ease to the Great Church, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where Moral Worship only was: he lets the Stately Temple-Worship go, and the glory of a National Government, and chooseth this mean way of a Synagogue, but yet endows it with the priviledge of a Temple; that so whereas, before God was Worshipped in the Mount, and in the Temple, he is now Worshipped as much, and as truly, and as spiritually every where, and in every Synagogue having the same priviledge. And indeed Christ's way in the Ordinances and Institutions of the Gospel was to choose that which in comparison, was before to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to the World, foolishness; thus he choose the foolishness of Preaching, and in stead of taking the High Priests and Rulers, he takes Fishermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But yet though Christ might speak in the Language of the Old Testament, it is not necessary that his meaning should be, that the Churches in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should be formed according as the Old were; but the contrary. Our Saviour Christ had said before in Matth. 16. 18. <hi>I will build my Church;</hi> and as he speaks of New Keys that are to be given, so by that he prepares their minds to a perswasion, that he would have a New Church Distinct from the former. And then afterward, here in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. he tells them more distinctly, that they should <hi>tell the Church.</hi> And if it be said, that they understand not what he meant by the word Church, or that they could not apprehend, that he meant by it a particular Congregation; and that they knew not too, what he meant by Keys, for certainly they knew not the particular Ordinances, which he intended under that general expression, <hi>The Keys of</hi> Heaven; and so neither knew they what this New Church, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. (to which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154381:33"/> they were <hi>to tell)</hi> might import? The answer is plain, that the Holy Ghost was to come on them, to tell them afterwards. And indeed our Saviour Christ spake of many things, which they then understood not, as of the Resurrection, Mat. 16. 21. <hi>I will destroy this Temple, and Build it in three Days;</hi> and also, <hi>that his Kingdom was not of this World,</hi> Jer. 18. 26. So when he washed his Disciples Feet, they knew not then the meaning of it; but he saith, he would <hi>send them the Comforter, which should tell them all things,</hi> John 14. 16. and <hi>chap.</hi> 16. 30. But yet it was necessary, that Christ should deliver the main Foundations of all those Truths, which the Holy Ghost afterwards should enlighten them in. <hi>Moses</hi> delivered many things in the Wilderness, concerning the Government of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which they could not so well understand, till they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and though they knew not the place that God would choose; yet many of the Laws that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> gave, depended upon it. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Saviour Christ had according to the liberty that then was given, unto all several Sects, (though we call not his such) built a Church, he had a little Flock, as he calls it: And as he began to Institute Baptism, and began to Institute the Lord's Supper afore he dyed, so to Institute this Church, he began it as other Ordinances afore his Death, and he did cast <hi>Judas</hi> out of it. And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The manner is oftentimes to speak in the Language of the Old Testament, when the same thing is not meant. As when Christ speaks of the Person offending, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 22. He expresseth the Degrees of punishment to several sins, under the Names of three Courts amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> and yet he meaneth Spiritual Degrees of punishment. Thus too, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. The whole service of the Sanctuary is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Altar, (He that serveth at the Altar, must live of the Altar)</hi> yet there is no such Altar erected amongst us, as was amongst the <hi>Jews.</hi> And the Prophets al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so prophesying of the times of the Gospel, spake of our Ordinances, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Old Testament, yet meant other Ordinances, anew to be Instituted; so in Isa. 66. 23. <hi>They shall go from one new Moon, unto another.</hi> Though under the Gospel, we have not Monthly Feasts and Meetings, as they had; yet the Meetings that we have, are exprest thereby. And so now here Christ speaks of a Church, that as the <hi>Jews</hi> had a Church so likewise under the New Testament, there should be a Church, to which Offences should be brought; but that Officers alone should be that Church, (supposing that the Ruling Officers, are called the Church in the Old Testament) it followeth not. For the word <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which was given to the Eldership of the Great <hi>Synedrim,</hi> of the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews;</hi> is now giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the Presbytery of every Congregation. So as though he useth the same word to express the Institution of the New Churches of the Gospel by, yet it follows not, that it is of the same kind with the Old, or that it runneth in the same way. But</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are rather to Interpret it by what kind of Churches we read afterwards, that the Apostles Erected. As <hi>Moses</hi> was Interpreted by the Prophets, so is Christ's mind in this to be known by his Apostles; for the Spirit came on them, and did Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal unto them Christ's Mind and Intention. The Tryal therefore will ly upon this, what Bodies, and consisting of whom, are called a Church in the Acts of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and in their Epistles.</p>
                  <p>What that Church is, upon which the Institution of Christ falleth, is not to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued meerly out of the Analogy of the Old Testament, for that will not set up an Institution in the New. But when we have found out what manner of Church in the New Testament, Jesus Christ hath Instituted, we are then to consider the Analogy of that Form thereunto, so far forth, as Christ hath applied it.</p>
                  <p>Now both in the Phrase of the New Testament, Assemblies consisting of Elders and People, and of the Saints, are called Churches, and in the words also of, <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>where two or three are gathered together in my Name,</hi> Christ tells us his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church. And unto this Church say we, doth the Analogy of all the Church under the Old Testament hold, if you take the due proportion; and as the excellent stories and allusions in the Old Testament, are brought into the New, to set forth things that come under the New, in the Book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> in their several proportions, (therefore speaking of <hi>Rome,</hi> he calleth it Spiritual <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp;c.) so we find that all the Types of the Old Testament, are applied unto these Assemblies. Thus as to the Temple, which was the Seat of Worship, and the Sacrifices there; Congregational Assemblies, hath carryed away the analogy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154381:33"/> of them by Christ's Institution; for they only are the fixed publick Seats of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, where Spiritual Sacrifices are offered. In Congregations the living Stones are built up together, to offer up living Sacrifices acceptable unto God, as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 22. And unto these Assemblies, are the same promises made, that were made to the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were a Church incamped in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, <hi>upon all their Assemblies, shall be a Cloud, and a Pillar of Fire,</hi> Prophecying of the Gospel, saith the Prophet <hi>Isa.</hi> Isa. 4. 5. And all the priviledges which that Nation had, as a Church, (take them in a Spiritual Respect) hath every Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints now. This therefore is called the House of God, over which Christ is an High Priest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. which in <hi>ver.</hi> 25. he Interprets to be the assembling of themselves together; In the compass of such an Assembly, also hath Jesus Christ contracted Appeals sufficient, for first (says he) <hi>tell him of his Fault thy self,</hi> then <hi>take two or three,</hi> and <hi>then go tell the Church;</hi> and then he is bound in Heaven, as the Supreamest Judicature, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 15, to 19. And God hath so advanced the State of the New Testament, above that of the Old; that as the Glory of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Temple, exceeded the First; so doth the Glory of the Saints now in these As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, excell all former. Every Believer is a Priest now; yea, the Allusion in the company of Saints assembled for Worship, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. is unto the Twenty four Priests that were over the Twenty four Companies of Priests. And the Officers now are, as the four Beasts in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Rev. 4. 8. and are as Angels, rather than Priests, called therefore the Angels of the Churches, <hi>Rev:</hi> 1. 20. The Saints all are a Royal Nation; and the Name of the City of God, is written upon every Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The great Presbytery or <hi>Synedrim</hi> of the People, is the Presbytery of every Congregation. Every Church is a City unto God, it is the City of the Living God; it is the Holy City, and hath a Government within it self, of Elders within its own Gates. Yea, here is the Synagogue-Government also, unto which the Allusion also is; and these Assemblies are so called, as I proved in the foregoing Chapter. Yea, and as God chooseth the mean things of the World under the Gospel, so he chose that Synagogue Frame; because the Worship therein was wholy Spiritual and Moral; it was not the Seat of Ceremonial Worship, as was the Temple. The Government of the Synagogues was natural, to cast any Person out of themselves, as all Bodies have by the Law of Nature, with a punishment suitable annexed, <hi>viz.</hi> to keep such from the esteem of Worshippers; and that they should be accounted as Heathens and Publicans. Thus Christ hath chosen a way more Spiritual, more Natural, suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablable to the Communion of Saints, that hath less Pomp and Glory in it. He hath taken this <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that was the least, the lowest of the Governments amongst them; and hath made it the greatest, and endowed it with the priviledges of all the rest. It hath both National and Temple priviledges, and <hi>Synedrim</hi> priviledges also, it hath the Spirituality of them all. There they have the Lord's Supper, in stead of the Passover; There they have the Altar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17, &amp;c. what glorious things are spoken of, in Jer. 3. 14, 15, 16. <hi>You shall say no more, the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, neither shall it come to mind,</hi> &amp;c. I <hi>will give you Pastors, according to mine own Heart, which shall feed you with Knowledge and Ʋnderstanding;</hi> and <hi>I will take you, one of a City, and two of a Tribe, call them out, and bring them to</hi> Zion. That <hi>Zion,</hi> is where the Pastors are Teaching, therefore meant of Congregations. He doth not take Nations, but Select out of Nations, out of Cities and Tribes, Saints here and there; and formeth them up into Congregations, because they have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors that feed them; and in such Congregations, is the feeding of the Pastors with Knowledge and Understanding. And this succeedeth the Ark of the Covenant, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the priviledges thereof. It is a Prophecy, of the calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>And yet if that Judicial Government, (as we may so call it) that was in Jury, were the Pattern, of all Church-Government future, although it would indeed then, by the analogy of it, erect a National Assembly, over the lesser Churches; yet even that would conduce to the Establishment of more, to the Congregational way we contend for; than our Brethren will yield them, and will militate against the Presbyterian Pattern, as it is practised, and that in these particulars. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, Each Town, as well as each City, had all Government within their Gates, as much as Cities; and the Elders in the Towns, were not to Appeal to the Elders in the Cities; but immediately to the National Assembly. In <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 14.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154381:34"/> there were the Rulers of all the Congregation, (which was all the whole Nation) mentioned, and the Elders of every City, and Judges thereof; City according to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> was every little Town. Thus <hi>Moses is said to be read in every City in the Synagogues,</hi> that is, in every Town; for they had Synagogues in Villages, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 21. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 18. (saith he) <hi>Judges and Officers shall thou make thee in all thy Gates,</hi> that is, in every Town; and therefore the <hi>Rabbins</hi> do say, that if it were a big City, where there were one Hundred and twenty Families in it, there were twenty three Sat in the Gate, if it were less, then but three; for there was no Court consisled of less.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That though it were granted, that the power of the Keys in Christ's Institution,</hi> Matth. 18. <hi>was given to the Elders, or Officers; and not to the People: That yet in a greater probability of Reason, the Officers or Elders of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregational Church are meant. That in all probability too, the Institution of such Churches, was designed by him; because their Conditions and Order, best suits the ends of the Edification of his Saints.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF by <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. were meant the Officers, yet still the Officers of a particular Church, for there is a Presbytery in every Church. And the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two or three, doth rather carry it to that meaning. So that if by Church, should be meant the Elders, yet question will return what Elders, in relation to what Church? To a particular Church say we. Thus when it is said, in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Send for the Elders of the Church,</hi> it could not be the Elders of a Presbyterian Church. Our Presbyterian Brethren acknowledge, that particular Congregations are Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; they are the first of the Name in this Institution, and are first intended, and are therefore called <hi>Ecclesiae primae, the first Churches,</hi> even by Presbyterians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. We are sure also, that particular Churches, have the Name of a whole Church. 1 Cor. 14. 23. <hi>If the whole Church meet in one.</hi> We are sure too, that the first Churches in all places, were but particular Churches, even in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it self. The Apostles did not forbear making a particular in any place, they did not stay till Christian's Church were multiplied, so as to make many Churches in one place. Now such a particular Church before Churches ever multiplied, had a Government within it self, by virtue of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. And if so, if here be an Institution, it falleth upon it; and it exercises its Government as a Church, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of its Charter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a particular Church is meant, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. is evident, because it is such a Church that is spoke of, whereof a Man is a Brother; and now he is a Brother
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154381:34"/> first, and more peculiarly of a particular Congregation; that's the Reason, why you Excommunicate him out of the particular Church, when out of none of all the rest. And when you bring the matter at last to an issue, you tell that Church of it, more than any of the rest; for that Congregation being a Church by the Order of Christ, it is to be brought unto that Church first, which the offending Person hath the relation of a Brother unto. Now see who are in the right, our Presbyterian Brethren, or we; they think themselves bound to tell the Church, because he is a Brother of it, but not at first; whereas Christ saith, Tell this Church first, and if he will not hear what that Church says, <hi>let him be an Heathen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The method that Christ here prescribeth, evidently argueth it to be a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church; for 1. Saith he, do thy self deal with him. 2. <hi>Take two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;</hi> 3. <hi>Tell the Church;</hi> This must needs be that particular Church, that is the next Body, for that particular Church, is a Church, and it is his Church; and it is a Body in ascent next to the two or three Witnesses; and if there be any such thing as a Church Classical, that is a degree beyond it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All that are for Presbyterial Government, do by virtue of this place, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. tell it to the Congregational Elders, the Presbytery. And so then, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation is meant in this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. both their Practices and Principles do import. For they argue from this place, by way of Analogy. They argue from hence, the power of many Churches over any Church; because, look what power the first Church hath over a Brother, that many Churches hath over a Church: And therefore according to their own Concessions, this first Church is first meant as the measure of the other; and therefore what is said here in <hi>Matth:</hi> 18. must be first true of the particular Congregation. For they make a Combination of Churches; for to deal with offending or disagreeing Churches, upon this ground, that a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church is that, which is here appointed to deal with a Brother. If then the Argument doth run by way of Analogy; then the power of their greater Churches, is fetched from the power that this particular Church hath. And they argue, that therefore they have an intire power over many Churches, because that this hath an intire power over its own Members; and that what power is in a particular Church is in the whole Body of Churches joyntly: And therefore by the Presbyterial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions and Principles, the Institution must first fall upon this Church Congregational. For if any Man would argue from what power a Corporation hath over its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that the like power many Corporations may have over that Corporation, it would imply, that that Corporation hath an intire power over its own Members; and look how much of the intireness of the power, you take away from the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Corporation, over its Members; so much you weaken the Argument and Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, for the power of many.</p>
                  <p>In a word, all the Arguments of all sides, of Papists, that would have the Pope to be the Church; of the Episcopal party that would have the Bishops to be the Church, all argue from the word Church. And they say, that a Diocesan hath power in a Diocess, because a whole Diocess may be one Church; and so, many Elders may make up a Presbytery, over many Congregations; because many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations make one Church. So as all these, and the Presbyterian Government it self, can prove their claim only, as they can make it out, that they are a Church. Now particular Congregations do, and may put first in for it, that they are Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; therefore as a Church, they must have a power over their own Members, as the other have over Churches, according to their own Principles.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The first and primary Institution, must fall upon particular Congregations, as the Seats or Bounds of the first power, whether the Institution be supposed to fall upon them as Churches, or as a Presbytery. If it falls on them as Churches, the greater Churches consisting of many Congregations are but <hi>Ortae,</hi> or <hi>sprung</hi> of this: If it falls on them as a Presbytery, they are but Compounds, and Decompounds. The Native and first Genuine Church, is the Congregational, the other are but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative Churches; when as this is more real.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the Institution of a Congregational Church, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. most suits with Christs Aim and Design, the Communion of Saints; so it most agrees too with that promise of his Presence, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. what kind of Assembly is most likely to be pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon by Christ, to be made his Court on Earth, but that wherein he is Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped; and where there is the personal Presence of his Saints, for whose sake he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154381:35"/> is present with the Officers of a Church; and not as they are Officers abstracted from the Church or Meeting, without it. And indeed it was for the Honour of the Saints, and was becoming of their State under the Gospel; that not Elders alone, but that Saints gathered together with the Elders, should be those fixed Bodies to which the power should be given; for so the Stile runneth, <hi>the Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 33. And what is the Church, without the presence of Christ? And what is more of a Church, than that to which more of the promise of the presence of Christ is made: Now to the Saints, and also to the Elders, as joyned and united in Bodies with Saints, is the promise made. Those promises, <hi>I will walk among you,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 26, 37. is made to the Bodies of Saints. So then if we take the State of the Saints under the New Testament, (where every one comparatively, is said more to know the Lord comparatively, unto those of the Old) it is answerably in a way of comparison, more suitable to Reason; that if the Government should be placed upon Bodies formed up, the Institution should fall upon such Bodies, as have both Saints and Elders. And if there were no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, yet this might be pleaded for it; that the Officers have, though nor formal, power from the People as Officers, yet a virtual power, concurrence and assistance (through the promise of Christ's presence with them) as such from the presence of the Saints, in respect of the execution of their Office, and the blessing thereof, (which they do not carry about them alone) especially in such Acts, wherein they do things as for the People, and which do concern them, as Acts of Jurisdiction do. Although as Elders Dedicated unto Christ, they might have a Blessing in Preaching unto them, and that as Elders, or in Prayer, or the like; yet in all Ministerial Acts of Jurisdiction, that belong to a Church as a Corporation, they have a virtual as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from the concurrence of the People with them, doing all this in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. Thus the Elders among the <hi>Jews,</hi> besides the Blessing of their Calling, as being Elders, and united into a Body over that Nation, in a <hi>Synedrim</hi> or Council, had also a Blessing from the place where they should meet, the place that God should choose, as also their Sacrifices had: And should the same <hi>Synedrim</hi> have met out of that place, they had not had that Assistance, neither could the Acts have been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Acts of Jurisdiction. This Principle the Papists themselves seem to acknowledge, who make the Assistance that the Pope hath, when he speaks infallibly as a Pope, to be not alone, but in the <hi>Cathedrâ,</hi> in the <hi>Chair;</hi> and so in Council with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals: And so in a State or Kingdom, though the ultimate concluding and ratifying of Laws, doth lye in the King; yet he doth not do it alone, but having all other Estates of Nobles and Commons present, or else what he doth, is not legal nor bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now so under the New Testament, though all Church-power should be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be formally in the Elders; yet not as abstracted from the presence of the Saints, which is in stead of the place that God then chose among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in which they had an especial Blessing and Assistance. Nay, he hath now chose a better Temple for Elders to exercise their Jurisdiction in, Temples made of living Stones, that is, Churches consisting of Saints, from the concurrence of whose Spirits, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Applications, the Acts done by the Elders in a Church, do receive their strength. So Jesus Christ is in the midst of the Elders; because his promise is to be in the midst of the Saints, their Spirits joyn and concur in the Act, and so there is an Efficacy runneth along therewith. And this Honour at least, was meet to be given by Christ, to his Saints under the New Testament. For what tho' the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be as the Loadstone; yet as the Virtue and Efficacy of the Loadstone, depends upon its being set in Steel, so the virtual Blessing of the Elder's Actions, in matters of Jurisdiction, (which are the highest Acts of Church-Government) depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their being in the midst of Saints, that concur with them. And therefore in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17. it is said, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> that is, the Elders joyning with, and in presence of the People. Although the Eye is that Member that doth see for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet it hath the Virtual Efficacy that inableth it to see, from its being placed in the Body; and as the Eye cannot see out of the Body, nor can one Body, being in another Bodie's Eye to see withal; so cannot this power of the Elders, be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed out of its Seat, nor a Forraign power be brought in. And therefore when the Apostle says, in 1 Cor. 5. 4. <hi>When ye are gathered together with the power of the Lord Jesus,</hi> and so in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>I will walk among you,</hi> and in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. when Christ promised I <hi>will be with you, to the end of the World,</hi> he speaks not only of Ministers, and the Successors of the Apostles; but of those also that believe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154381:35"/> through their word, for so in <hi>John</hi> 17. 20. he interprets it; and likewise in <hi>John</hi> 15. 16. <hi>your Fruit shall remain,</hi> and so be both with Ministers and Saints, as Successors of the Apostles; this being the Honour of the Apostles, not only to have Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to Succeed them, but Churches of Believers also, with whom Christ is. And therefore in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where Jesus Christ's presence in the Church of the New Testament, is presented with Allusion to that of the Old, <hi>chap.</hi> 4. although the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is of the Church Universal materially considered; yet formally the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of it is made, as it is the Seat of publick Worship; and therefore represented under the <hi>Idea,</hi> of a Congregational Assembly, as appeareth, (as Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> and <hi>Parker,</hi> and others have observed) in that it is set forth in order to Acts of publick Worship, performed therein. Thus there is the Laver to wash in, as in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there was, before they Worshipped; unto which the Apostle makes the Allusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for meeting in the House of God for Worship, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 21, 22, &amp; 25. verses compared; <hi>Let us draw near with a pure Heart, and Bodies washed,</hi> which afterward <hi>(ver.</hi> 25.) he expounds to be Assembling themselves together. And in that, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. the four Beasts, who are the Leaders and the <hi>Chorus</hi> for Worship, when they fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l down, and cast down their Crowns, the Elders do so too. Now those Assemblies, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position on the</hi> 4th <hi>and</hi> 5th <hi>cha.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. <hi>in</hi> vol. 2. <hi>of bis Works.</hi>
                     </note> in which Jesus Christ hath thus set his Throne and Temple, they consist of Elders and Beasts, having Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, Saints and Officers; for such is the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Saints, now in comparison of those under the Old Testament, that they themselves are called the Elders; and the four living wights, are those four sorts of Officers of Congregations. The thing we cite it for, is this; that the Throne and Presence of Christ, is with the Beasts, as joyned with the twenty four Elders, and in Assemblies made up of both. And therefore the Officers are said to be set in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and so to work still, as set in the Church, but they are no where called the Church it self.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and though the Apostles were made immediately by Christ, without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to any special or particular Church; and in order principally unto gathering and rearing up Churches, yet the choice of one Apostle was made in a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Church, consisting of Angels and People, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> tho' made Apostles immediately by Christ; yet received their Ordination in such a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, whilst the Elders were Ministring unto the Lord, in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 13. Yea, and they themselves ordinarily, did not exercise any Acts of Jurisdiction, either of Ordination, or Excommunication, but as still present in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church. They did not set up a Court, unto which Churches were to come; but they rather came themselves, and visited Churches, ordained Elders in every Church with Fasting and Prayer in the Churches; and ordinarily they Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated not, (tho' they might give general Directions) but in a Church. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if there might be Cases wherein the Apostles did Excommunicate alone; yet they were very extraordinary, and no way to be imitated, as their Miracles are not. They did not Excommunicate when absent, 2 Cor. 13. 10. <hi>Shall I come with a Rod? And when I come, I shall bewail some of you,</hi> &amp;c. As therefore the Apostles did not set up a Court out of particular Presbyteries, so Presbyteries are not to set up a Court out of particular Churches. Yea, in that only instance of a Synod, which we have in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. the Transactions of the Apostles and Elders were in, and with that Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> where the Brethren also were present. Thus hath God Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Saints of the New Testament, that the promise of the presence of Christ, should be made to them, when gathered together with their Officers; and that he will be with the Officers even as such, for the Peoples sake. You know, (saith the Apostle to the <hi>Thessalonians)</hi> what manner of Men we were among you, for your sakes, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 5. They have not only a Ministerial power for them as they are in; but they have a Ministerial power through them, as having it for their sakes, and by vertue of their Communion, God's promise being to be in the midst of them, by vertue of their presence. So as although they have not a power derived to them, <hi>ab Ecclesiâ,</hi> as <hi>from the Church;</hi> yet they have it derived to them in <hi>Ecclesia, in the Church,</hi> and also instrumentally, <hi>ab Ecclesiâ.</hi> And although they Act not the power that is in the Church in their stead, and for their ease, doing such Acts, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Church should, (as those of the Separation have held) yet the Assistance of the Exccution of their power, is virtually in the Church, the promise being made to them as a Church. Neither are they the Church Representative, having a power
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154381:36"/> absent, and abstracted from the People, as is the Nature of all Representations, (for nothing is Represented, that is present) but the Church it self is the <hi>Sedes,</hi> the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seat, in which this power is exercised, as the Body is of the actions of the principal Members; the Spirit, and Strength, and Vigour of the whole Body, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring and assisting the Acts of all such Members: And therefore Excommunication, is in the Name of Christ; that is, as some say, <hi>in vocato nomine,</hi> or <hi>of Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon;</hi> and so as having the Prayers of the People of God to assist, to put force and efficacy into it. And so Ordination is done with Fasting and Prayer; and the Prayers of the Saints, the least Saints have as much influence unto the virtual assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Officers in their Acts before them, as the Prayers of the Elders them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and therefore the Presbyterial acts that are abstracted thus from the People, have not that efficacy in them as when the Body of Saints and Elders are joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So as the Institution falleth not only upon Elders, but upon Elders and People as a Body formed up of both, not only because all acts of Worship and Jurisdiction, are for the Edification of the Saints as well as of the Elders: But it is because that Jesus Christ will have the assistance of their Spirits and of their Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which have as much efficacy in them to prevail with him for a Blessing, as those of the Elders had.</p>
                  <p>And in this respect the keys (as was said before) are given unto <hi>Peter</hi> both as a Saint and as a Minister, as both respects considered did meet in him, when the keys were given to him, so that the words <hi>to their,</hi> include both. So that at least the keys are so given to the Ministers, as to be exercised before, and in the presence of the Saints, having an assistance from the concurrence of their Spirits and Desires. The Papists would have the keys given to <hi>Peter</hi> alone, simply and absolutely, only they say indeed for the Church, but they do not make the Church the subject to which the keys are given. Others do make the Church the first subject to whom the keys are given, and not only for whom, but then they make the Elders the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative Church, and so that they are given to Elders only to be exercised instead of the Church. But we say they are given so to the Church, as that if they should not be the formal subject of parted power together with the Elders, yet they are the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual subject in which the Elders should exercise them. And hence it is that the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Church is from the Saints, and not given to the Officers any where in the New Testament. The Officers are said to be set in the Church, but they are not called the Church. For a Church of Christ must needs be a Body to Christ, that still is the <hi>periphrasis</hi> of a Church. Now as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>A Body is not one Member, but many,</hi> (and from thence it is rightly argued, that a Bishop is not the Church for he is but one) so nor is a Presbytery of Elders although many <hi>the Body</hi> for they bear not the immediate relation of a Body to Christ himself, but are only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of his Body. And as Members of all sorts do make a natural body, not only Members that are the Principal and Rule the Body, but also those that are ruled and ordered. So is it here.</p>
                  <p>And when Christ in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. saith, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> having first told the party alone himself, then brought a Brother or two; as the sin of the offending party doth by this increase, and grow more hainous, so the number of those by whom he is now to be rebuked that are called the Church, must be supposed to increase also, and therefore not two or three Elders of a Congregation alone. This last is the last and the highest remedy, and therefore the publickness must not lye only in respect that they are publick Persons, Officers, for if it be told privately only in a Consistory, it is as private as if it were told to two or three of the Brethren before, or it may so be, that the same Elders had been taken to be the Brethren that should admonish him. By the word Church therefore, is meant a greater company, and therefore not the Elders alone, but the Elders before the Church, or rather the Elders in the Church, with whom the Church is to joyn in the Admonitions and Rebukes of him.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that by making the People thus the Church rather than the Elders, it argues that more Authority is given to the People than the Elders in the Church. The answer is, That that follows not; it only follows that there is more efficacy and vertue by reason of the Church, and the presence of the Elders in the Church, although the Authority should lye in the Elders themselves, as the vertue by which the Eye seeth, lyeth in the Body subjectively and virtually more, though the Eye alone is the Instrument of seeing.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:154381:36"/>
                  <p> We argue also for this Congregational Institution to have been rather appointed than the other, because that the bounds of this are certain, and are natural. God (as <hi>Baines</hi> saith) did never set a Church but he did set certain bounds of it; As when he made the Jewish Church a Nation, he set the bounds of it to be that of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argueth that therefore Bishops are not <hi>Divino Jure</hi> of <hi>Divine Right,</hi> because God did not make Dioceses, and did not set them out by Lot as he did that of the Tribes. And it was therefore a great contention among Bishops of old in those times of the fourth and fifth Century, to whose jurisdiction such and such Villages or Towns should belong. In a word, the Church is God's House, and God hath not left it unto man to frame his building to what proportion he pleaseth. Christ's Body instituted (which is resembled unto the natural body throughout the Epistles) is to have set limits of it, a <hi>maximum quod sic.</hi> and if it have all the parts, that can have communion natural in the same common acts of Nature together, though it be never so small, it is a perfect body; so as it hath a prescription, and bounds are set it both for parts, and a <hi>Maximum quod sic</hi> for degrees of Stature. Now we have natural and set bounds for all instituted Churches. in this way of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The same Assembly that doth meet for Worship, is to meet for Discipline, so that Discipline and Worship is of equal extent, as touching the Seat of it. Now the publick Worship is upheld by no other Society, in a constant way, nor can be, but by Congregations, as many as can meet to edifie in one place. And therefore by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of fixed Congregations God hath always preserved the Essentials of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Church, that although it suffered additionals of corruption in Power, and of Tyranny in Popish Bishops and Popes and the like over them, yet still because the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Church fell upon Congregations, there were true Ministerial Churches, and a true Baptism and the like in all Ages.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Congregational Government, hath its bounds natural from a sufficiency of Elders, for the sorts and kinds of them; There is no sort appointed on purpose or alone for Presbytrial Government, as for Episcopal it was pretended there was, but even all the sorts that are, the seats of them are Congregational, and where all are, there is a sufficiency of Eldership, as we shall after shew. A Congregational Church had Elders of all sorts appointed to it, as for what belongeth to Worship, Pastors and Teachers, and as for what belongeth to Mens Lives; ruling Elders, and there is no more Elders but of these sorts in the greatest Presbyteries over many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Yea the Presbyteries themselves of many Congregations, must come furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all these sorts out, of their having all these sorts in their particular Congregations: And our Presbyteries cannot say, this Church shall have a Pastor, and this Church shall have a Teacher, and this Church shall have a ruling Elder, and so we will make up a Presbytery out of all these; but every Church is the seat <hi>de jure, by Divine Right,</hi> of all these, and every Church hath need of all these, and Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed these to Congregations first.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We can derive the Limits of Congregational Churches from the time that is Instituted for Worship, which is the Lord's Day, which God hath fixed, and on which Day no other Churches meet, and so there is no set time for the exercise of a Presbyterial Church. It is <hi>Baines</hi> his argument against the Bishops that God did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point for all Church-Meetings under the Law a time. And in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time we read that the Censures of Excommunication were executed upon the Lord's Day, and Admonition and the like, though things might be prepared upon the Week Days. And the Apostle's words in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. That <hi>they shall cast him out when they are met together,</hi> (he doth not bid them meet together on purpose) seems to incline to it. We know of no time that God hath appointed for all Ordinances (whereof this is one) in a set way as the fixed season of them, but only this Lord's Day, and upon this Day Presbyterial Churches cannot meet for Government.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That the duties which lie upon the relation of Elders to Preach and to Rule, should all be of the same extent (for the subject of them over which they are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) all this falleth in naturally with the Institution of Congregations, and Elders over them, and the relation of Elders to them. Men should not govern ordinarily beyond their Preaching. This is evident from what the New Testament holds forth concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders in their relations to their Flocks committed to them, the Exhortations and Charges to them of duties towards those Flocks founded upon that relation: As also
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154381:37"/> the Duties of their Flocks to them: Which is like to be the truest measure, to find out the extent of their power, and bounds of their Flocks; whether for the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way it be limited to one Congregation, or many. For those Exhortations must needs be supposed suited to the boundaries of Churches, and to that Constitution and Extent of Relation, wherein the Elders of these Primitive Times, were placed over them. And like as in the question about <hi>Polygamy,</hi> what the Scripture hath said, of the Duties of Man and Wife; which were given and suited to the Extent of that Relation, as God from the beginning bounded it, manifestly evinceth, that one Man cannot have many Wives, but one; so it may be argued as to the point in hand.</p>
                  <p>We have hitherto taken this for an undoubted Maxim, that as a Mutual Relation, is the Fountain of all power, whether <hi>Oeconomical, Civil,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> so the extent of all power is commensurable, with the extent of that Relation. A Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, as a Master, hath power but over such Servants, of whom he may say, <hi>I am your Master;</hi> and they of him, <hi>we are your Servants; for what hath any Man to do to judge another Man's Servant?</hi> As the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. And so corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondently here, those Elders that assume to be over either one, or many Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, must have as the Office of Elders, so the Relation of Elders unto that one, or those many Congregations, that they may be able to say, <hi>we are your Elders,</hi> and <hi>you all our Church;</hi> which two are in Scripture expression, the Relate and Correlate, as King and Kingdom, Magistrates and Common-wealth. All which falls in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, for the set bounds of a Church, to be those of Congregations. Whereas the bounds, that the Presbyterial way goeth by, in all their Subordinations, are uncertain. You have not a certainty of number of Officers, some particular Congregations, have as many Officers, as some Classes have had. Neither is it essential to that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that there should be many Congregations; for they acknowledge that it may so fall out, that there may be but one Congregation, that may have all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in it, in cases of necessity. But it is essential to upholding Worship in all the parts of it, that there be a fixed Congregational Church:</p>
                  <p>And to make the Jurisdiction of Cities, to be the pattern of Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot be a certain Rule. For <hi>London,</hi> or Greater Cities, (as suppose Grand <hi>Cairo</hi> was converted) would vastly exceed the lesser; and so the Rule would fall in Disproportion, if you come in the Country Towns and Villages. And indeed what Reason can be given, that God should proportion an Ecclesiastical Government to the boundaries of the Civil? What! Because the Cities under the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, had a Jurisdiction in them, and they <hi>over</hi> their Suburbs, must their Churches have so too? Hath God thus conformed his Church, unto the Government of this World? And besides all States, have not the like Government, neither was the Government of all Countries, a City-Government; and so there could be no certain Rule for Church-Government, if it were to be chalked out by these measures.</p>
                  <p>Neither is the Government of Nations, a certain Rule for that of the Church, for the <hi>Jews</hi> after that rate, when they were two Nations, should have been but one Church. And indeed, to Form the Institution of a Church, to that boundary, had been to do it from what is accidental; for that they should grow up to a Nation, is accidental. God did find the <hi>Jews</hi> a Nation entire, entred into a Covenant with them, and so made them a National Church. And if God had designed a National Church under the New Testament, he would have given Laws aforehand, as he did for the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they should come into Cities; so that although they were now in the Wilderness, and they were not to come into Cities, till they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Canaan</hi> many years after; yet he giveth a Law, for that condition of their being a Nation, and living in Cities.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That Congregational Churches, were designed in the Institution of Christ, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Instances of the Primitive Churches, planted by the Apostles. The first Instance Assigned from the States, and Order of the Church at</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOW for the proof of all, or most of the particulars, of which I have Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed in the preceding Chapters, I shall bring as the conclusion of all the Instances of the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> which is the greatest and surest Pattern, and the most compleat of all other. It is the greatest Pattern, because it answers to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. (as in the Directions given to that Church in the, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and the Phrases, that about Excommunication, are put into it, being compared with that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. doth appear) As there, Christ in the promise that he makes to the Church, when it bindeth sin, useth that Phrase; <hi>Where two or three are joyned together, I am in the midst of them;</hi> Mat. 18. 20. So here likewise, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. the Apostles Direction runs in the same Phrase, <hi>when you are gathered together:</hi> As there Christ saith, <hi>gather together in my Name,</hi> so here the Apostle saith, <hi>when ye are gathered together in my Name, and with the power of the Lord Jesus.</hi> As Christ there in his promise, he saith, <hi>I will be in the midst of you,</hi> when ye are so gathered; so here speaking of their gathering together, and throwing him out of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Apostle useth the same Phrase, <hi>Take him from the midst of you:</hi> As thereupon his being cast out, he is to be reckoned as an Heathen and a Publican, with whom the <hi>Jews</hi> would not eat; so here, if a Brother be thus, they are not to accompany with him, no, not to eat with him. It is the surest Instance of the ordinary power left in a Church, because it was a Church that was formed up, in which there was that ordinary Government, which was to continue to the end of the World. The Instance of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> is an Instance, though of the first Church, yet for the Government of it, hath this extraordinary in it, that it was then Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Apostles; and therefore cannot make a Pattern of the Government of Churches, and the power of Elders therein, which should ordinarily, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance be exercised. But this is an Instance of a Church, whom the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> leaves to their own power, that is within them, <hi>(Do not ye judge,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.) which they had exercised and practised. The Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> also had many other things Extraordinary, as that about having their Goods common, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Rules, that he gives to this Church, are such as he gave to all Churches; so when he speaks about laying up, not making their Goods common, as at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but the ordinary way that was to be observed concerning Alms, <hi>Let every Man lay up,</hi> (saith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 3. 2, 3, 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17.) <hi>as God hath Blessed him; and so I ordain in all the Churches:</hi> So as the Pattern hereof is held forth, as that which held corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency with the Ordinances in all Churches in the Primitive Times. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is an Argument against the Bishops, when they urged the Instances of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> Presbyterian Divines used to answer, that the Instance of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not hold as a Pattern for Episcopal Government; because that their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was Extraordinary, and for the present, but that we must take that which was the ordinary Government, that was left in the Church, and make that the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern. So we may say of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and the Government thereof at first by the Apostles, whilst they were there, comparatively to this of the Church-of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that it is not so great a standing pattern to us. And this of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is the most compleat pattern of all other Churches, for he doth give directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on almost about all sort of things concerning Worship and Government, and he utters more rules in his Epistles to this Church than any other. Thus he gives instructions concerning the Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. about Minister's Maintenance, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. about matter of scandal and offence, <hi>chap.</hi> 8. about Collection for the Poor, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. How to order their Meetings, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. About covering and uncovering in their Assemblies, he saith he had left Traditions with them, and wherein they practised according to his Traditions he commendeth them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. He speaks also of the power amongst them to judge of Doctrine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. And that they were a Church that had power
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:154381:38"/> amongst them to order things for matter of Worship in a decency, <hi>Let all be done decently and according to order,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 40. and many things of the like nature. And last of all it is the only instance and example of Excommunication, the highest cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which the Apostle gives direction about, and tells them they had power to do it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning this Church, there are all these things appertaining to a Church, and the Institution, and Power, and Government thereof held forth here; As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is a Church. So it is called.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is the qualifications of the Members, a Church of Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. conformable to which all other Churches were to be, as to the constitution of their Members also, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 33. <hi>As in all the Churches of the Saints;</hi> All the Churches consisted of Saints then, that were visibly such, as this of <hi>Corinth</hi> also did.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was a Church formed up into a Body, as all those phrases imply, that they are called a whole lump, <hi>chap.</hi> 5, 6. and a whole Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 23. intire, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat within it self, which whole lump would be leavened, not only by the way of infection by the Incestuous person, but by way of guilt if he were not cast out.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was a Body which had power to judge them that are within; <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> chap. 5. 13. that is, within your own Body and Society and Fellowship, therefore also he saith, <hi>Put away from among your selves,</hi> chap. 5. 13. therefore he useth those phrases, <hi>Fornication is committed among you; that he that did this deed may be taken from among you,</hi> chap. 1. 1, 2. It was a Church formed up that had a jurisdiction over them within, (and to them without it could not reach) and if they had power to cast out they had also power to take in, it was therefore a formed body.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It was a fixed Body in respect of the relation of the Members one unto another; why else doth he bid them to tarry one for another when they were to Eat the Lord's Supper? <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 33. And that they should not take the Sacrament alone, one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by themselves, and another company by themselves, which, if such a promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unfixt way was lawful, they might have done, but they were to tarry one for another, that all the Church might as one Body at once receive. Now if they had not been a fixed company, why should they have been obliged thus to have tarried, or who could have known who was absent and who present?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It was a Church also that had Elders over them, and those more than one, for speaking of the ordinary Teachers that were Ministers amongst them, some say (saith he) <hi>I am of Paul, and I am of Apollos, and I am of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 12. which he in a figure transferred to himself and to <hi>Apollos,</hi> herein speaking in his own person, but it tendeth to represent the Persons of their Teachers, the Ministers to whom they did give Maintenance, and were therefore Officers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12. <hi>If others be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this power over you, are not we rather?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. It was a Church having set bounds, by which they might know who were within, and who not, for when he saith, <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 13. he doth not mean all Saints in all Churches, but it must be those within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The bounds set by this, that they might be <hi>as many as could meet in one As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,</hi> 1 Cor. 14 23. If the whole Church be come together in one place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. It was a particular Congregation. 1. This is evident from their divisions and contentions which he findeth fault withal, as in a whole Church, a whole Body, <hi>That there be no Schism in the Body,</hi> as he himself expresseth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25. applying it to them, now ye are the Body of Christ and Members in particular; he speaks of these divisions as being among those that did meet in one for Worship, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>For first when ye come together in the Church, I hear there be divisions among you, and I partly believe it.</hi> And this Division was in their Meetings in the Church for Worship, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. And <hi>have ye not Houses to Eat and Drink in, but despise ye the Church of God,</hi> the Assembly of the Saints, as he reproves their divisions and disorders in respect of the Sacrament? To remedy these divisions, he bids them tarry one for another, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. Thus these directions concern them that are one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation for Worship, that use to meet in one place; And <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 21. he saith they were Members of one another in particular, in a more special relation: Now that special particular near relation is that between those of the same Congregation, where they meet fixedly for Worship, by the consent, and before the People, of which a Man is therefore cast out, which he is not out of any other Church in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:154381:38"/> World. 2. In this respect he calleth them a Temple to God, speaking against them that caused Divisions in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>The Temple of God are ye,</hi> and that he that went about to destroy it by Divisions, God would destroy him: He speaks not personally of each Member, as in <hi>chap.</hi> 6. but in respest of their Church state, as they were a Body, in opposition to Divisions: Now the Temple is for all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Worship, therefore called the House of God. 3. He gives directions to them as to a whole Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>If the whole Church be come together in some place.</hi> 4. He speaks of it also as a Church, which was to receive edifying to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ordinances Administred, so <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>I would that ye all spake with Tongues, but rather that ye Prophesied, for greater is he that Prophesieth than he that speaks with Tongues, that the Church may be Edified,</hi> so ver. 12. <hi>See that ye ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to the Edifying of the Church.</hi> And if the whole Congregation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 26. He speaks this in application to them all in respect of their meeting, <hi>How is it then Brethren when ye come together,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>As their Assembly for Worship proves them to have been a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Worship. So also the directions given concerning Excommunication evince it, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. For if they had been many Congregations in respect of their Members, 1. He would have Written to that particular Congregation whereof the Man was, as that Congregation (at least the Elders thereof) which should (according to Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial principles) be told first of an offending Member before he is brought to the classical. He would have named that Church he was thus a Member of, and written to it in a peculiar manner, whereas now he names none, but writes to the whole Church. 2. When his directions come to fall upon the execution of the act, he doth not mention the Sentence so much that was to be past (according to our Brethren) in the Presbytery, but the act of execution, the act of delivery to Satan was to be done when they were met together, which being to be done in that particular Church whereof he was a Member, if there had been many Congregations there, he would have named that Church as that in which it should have been done. Especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the Apostle in his Writing pitcheth upon that solemn act of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which compleateth the throwing of a Man out, which as all grant is done and performed in the gathering together of that particular Congregation, whereof a Man is a Member. 3. If there had been a classical Church over many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where the Elders meet, and a Congregational Church too, where this person did meet with the Elders of his own Church and the Congregation, if there had been these two several sorts of Church Meetings, it would have been obscure and dark▪ unto which the Apostle's directions should refer him. So as there would have been need of new distinctions of Meetings as well as of Elders and Churcches, when the Apostle speaks but of one. Yea the Apostle saith, <hi>When met together,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4. namely for other Ordinances, upon the Lord's Day, that then they should give this Sentence of Excommunication. He doth not give directions that they should meet together on purpose for that, but as Discipline is to keep Worship pure and subserveth it, so also is it to be performed when the whole meet together for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, that the Person also may see out of what a Communion he is cast. 5. Saith he, <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> If there had been Congregational Churches, one whereof he had been a Member of (for he could be but a Member of one) and another classical Church, here had been two <hi>Within,</hi> and which of these should the Apostle intend? Our Presbyterian Brethren say, That the Congregations have power to judge things within themselves, so that they must needs have one <hi>Within,</hi> and why should not their <hi>Within</hi> be the <hi>Within</hi> here intended for the ultimate throwing out of this Man?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> also had an intire Judicature within it self, not depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the advice of any for Sentence, and the like; for he speaks of the whole act, <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> He useth the same word that he useth of himself and his power, <hi>Do not ye judge</hi> (saith he) speaking of them, <hi>what have I to do to judge,</hi> speaking of himself. And (saith he) <hi>when ye are gathered together with my Spirit, and the Power of the Lord Jesus to deliver such an one to Satan;</hi> So that they were not dependent upon the Apostle, to come to him for the Sentence, only in their neglect the Apostle Writes to them as an Apostle, with this rule, to Excommunicate such an one if the be party found guilty, which the Apostle did never know but by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say, therefore could never pass a judicial sentence, but he finds fault with them, because
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:154381:39"/> they had not done it, for do not ye use to do it saith he? Have not ye power to do it? <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> He doth not say, <hi>whom I have delivered unto Satan;</hi> but directs them as a Church of Christ having such power, to do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it is objected by some, that he did it for a trial of their obedience, and therefore their act was but an act of obedience in them, but the power was in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The answer is this, that the power might compleatly rest in them, and yet they obey the Apostle in the act, as an Apostle directing them, when they neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: As when a Prophet in the name of God bad the Magistrate to do his duty, though it is an act of Obedience in him to do it thus commanded, yet he hath power as a Magistrate in himself: And as in case a Minister had neglected to Baptize, and the Apostle had sent to him or commanded him to have done it, the power of Baptizing must be said to be in him that Baptizeth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. If this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had been a Church that might have associated, it would have done it, for it had a neighbour Church near it, the Church of <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> which was a Port Town to <hi>Corinth</hi> as <hi>Leeth</hi> is to <hi>Edenburgh;</hi> and <hi>Cenchrea</hi> was but a small Town, not a City; but he writeth to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> as an intire Church distinct of it self.</p>
                  <p>That the People have an interest in judging, we refer that to the proofs out of this place; only we name it here to shew the compleatness of this pattern, for the forming of Congregational Churches answerable to it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the Name of a Church given in the New Testament to Congregational Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es rather than any other</hi> (as is proved from several Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1, &amp; 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17, &amp;c.) <hi>proves Congregational Churches to have been intended by Christ in his Institution of a Church, they most properly being both in name, and nature such. That a Presbyterian Assembly of Elders cannot properly be called a Church: Evinced by several Arguments.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TO decide the controversie about the Divine Institution of a Congregational Church, we may put it to the trial, whether single Congregations with their Elders have more the style of Churches in the New Testament, than the Elders of many Congregations as assembled in a Consistory; and let that determine it. Now that those Congregations where God is publickly Worshipped, and the Preaching of the Word, and the Sacraments Administred, are called each of them a Church, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>When you come together in the Church:</hi> He speaks of their Meeting for the Lord's Supper, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. he calls it so again. So their meeting for Preaching, and for singing of Psalms, he calls it a Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>ver.</hi> 2, &amp; 19, &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 23. he calls it a whole Church, meeting for those ends. And there he gives not the name to the Meeting or Assembly but to the state and company, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. for the Rules, he giveth there, are for ordering of Worship. So too in <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 4. saluting <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> (who for his Life would lay down their own necks) he giveth these Congregations the name of Churches, unto whom (saith he) <hi>not only I give thanks, but also all the Churches of the Gentiles,</hi> and ver. 16. <hi>The Churches of Christ salute you.</hi> Were those a company of Elders over many Congregations met? Presbyterial Churches, that did testifie their thanks unto <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla?</hi> Or were they Congregations of Saints and Strangers also where <hi>Paul</hi> had been? He had related unto them his own danger, and <hi>Aquila's,</hi> and <hi>Priscilla's,</hi> exposing their lives for his, and can it be supposed that the Saints as making several Presbyterial Churches (who are so vast, like unto ours, as the People never meet to do it) did salute the <hi>Romans,</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla?</hi> No rather the several Congregational Churches, might well have opportunity to express the remembrance of them at their Meetings. And the 1. <hi>ver.</hi> and the 5. <hi>ver.</hi> of <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. will easily prompt us what manner of Churches
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:154381:39"/> he meaneth, when he speaks of all these Churches, that they were such as was at <hi>Cenchrea, the Church which is at Cenchrea</hi> (saith he) which was a small Port seven miles off <hi>Corinth;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 5. (saith he) <hi>Greet ye the Church that is (i. e.</hi> that met) <hi>in Priscilla's House.</hi> Such Churches as these were the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who saluted them. If we come to the Epistle of the <hi>Corinths,</hi> saith the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>As I teach every where in every Church.</hi> Doth he mean these Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Churches or Consistories? Or Congregational? Surely the Churches where <hi>Paul</hi> still Preached and Taught must be Congregational; For those Assemblies are the Subjects and Seats of Teaching. Take also the <hi>17th verse</hi> of the <hi>7th chapter,</hi> and bring it along unto the <hi>11th chapter; So I ordain in all the Churches;</hi> and, <hi>We have no such custom nor the Churches of God;</hi> What! Presbyterial? Or Congregational? Let but this one consideration decide it. The custom of which he speaks that the contentions were about, was whether Men should be uncovered or covered praying or prophesying. Now all the Meetings for Worship where Men and Women, and where the Angels (whether Celestial or Elders) were present, these Assemblies where these Ordinances were used, he calleth Churches, and he saith they had no such custom. And in these respects of Meeting thus for Worship they are distinguished, Churches, and are made several, Churches in the <hi>Plural;</hi> and the general usages of all these Churches as constituted and ordered by the Apostles every where, he here presseth. If we come to <hi>chap.</hi> 14. He there gives order about Prophecying in their Meetings, into which Strangers came and were converted, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. In which they had Psalms and Doctrines, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. Where Men and Women were present, <hi>ver.</hi> 34, and 35. and therefore Congregational Meetings are meant. And he inforceth these directions he gives, with the examples of all the like Churches in all their Meetings, <hi>God is not the Author of Confusion but of Peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> ver. 33. These must needs be Congregational Assemblies and Churches that met, for he speaks of the Churches of the Saints in common. Yet still you see when he speaks of Churches, yea and of all Churches, he speaks of them as such. And <hi>ch.</hi> 16. 1. When he Writeth about laying up Contribution for the Saints (the gathering and disposing of which belongeth unto particular Congregations, for the Money to be sure is had from thence) <hi>As I have given order</hi> (says he) <hi>to the Churches of Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, so do ye,</hi> he meaneth those Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> he wrote to, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. And these must be all Congregational, for to order that collection belongeth to the several Congregations. And <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>The Churches of Asia</hi> (saith he) <hi>salute you.</hi> Now the many Congregations under a Presbytery, they do not meet to give salutes, they were therefore Congregational, for with a Congregational Church in this salute he doth joyn them all, for he addeth, <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> saluteth you with the Church that is in their House, and why should we not think that he speaks uniformly in the same verse. This we see is the uniform style of the Apostle when he speaks of Churches and of all Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the very name <hi>Church</hi> in the New Testament, the place of Congregational Meetings almost in all Languages hath the Name of Church, which name, no places, for General Councils or Presbyterial Meetings over many Congregations, at any time, have had. Not that we think the Place of Meeting to be properly called the Church, but only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but yet it had originally its name from the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the Persons, which were properly called the Church, and from their stated condition to meet in one place, the place was so named. The Clergy indeed hath been called the Church, but not as met, or assembled in any Synod, but in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite Universal Notion. But the place for the Congregation is called the Church, and the Meeting of the Saints hath the same name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. <hi>Let your Women keep silence in the Churches.</hi> And their constant Meeting in a fixed manner, and their state in order thereto is called the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 26. The Sacrament also was Antiently called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, i. e. <hi>the Meeting,</hi> their Meetings being said to be to break bread, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. And in the great Bible the word Church is always translated by Congregation. And among the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was never used for a representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Meeting only of Officers, but of the People also, and so it is in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 39, 41. where the People making a tumult, it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, although an unlawful one. And although that Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. used the Hebrew phrase, yet Churches being to be set up among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the New Testament, that phrase was used also which was conformed unto what theirs signified.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:154381:40"/>
                  <p> Also under the New Testament the Name Church imports the Saints the People, in a more peculiar manner; and therefore the Meetings where Elders are severed from the People, are not called the Church. <hi>Grotius</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 18. And this to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions which are used in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Shew ye are the Temples of the Living God, I will dwell in them and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my People.</hi> And in <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5. <hi>Prayer was made of the Church, i. e.</hi> of the Saints, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for Peter.</hi> Yea this word Church is taken for the People of <hi>Israel</hi> under the Old Testament, as <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 38.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We desire one place to be given, where the Name Church in all the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is given, to the meeting of the Elders alone. When the Apostle speaks of all the Churches, he gives them this appellation, all the Churches of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33. but he no where expresseth the Churches of the Ministers, or Elders, no nor of the Apostles neither. Now can we think that Christ in his first Institution <hi>(Mat.</hi> 16. &amp; <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.) which the Apostles were to Interpret afterward, and to give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to us about it, meaned the word Church in a signification different from what the Apostles used? This would be a strange procedure indeed. How then can the Elders lay a claim to the things, when they have not a sufficient ground to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the name of a Church. As <hi>Parker</hi> replying to Dr. <hi>Billson</hi>'s Assertion of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Parkerus de Polit. Eccles. Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>Clemens Epist. ad Corinth.</hi> pag. 1.</note> Keys being given in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Person to the Church of Ministers very well says, <hi>That it may be denied, that the name Church is ever in the Scriptures restrained only to the Priests. Clemens Romanus</hi> when he Writes to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> Writes to the Church, and not to the Presbyters (so the Apostles too in their Epistles) and Writes also from the Church at <hi>Rome.</hi> And when all the Apostles were met at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> yet they alone are not called the Church, being but (as <hi>Moses</hi> is said to be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2, 5. a part of the House, but no where called the House) a part of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1. <hi>The Church was scattered except the Apostles.</hi> And indeed if the Elders were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Church, then they were the House of God, whereas they are but stewards in it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. The Apostles tho' they had the care of all the Churches, and that power in their hands which the Generality of Elders would never claim, yet they were but Officers in the Church, not the Church. Many Churches become one Church to no Officer in the World but Christ, but this pretence of the Elders being the Church, would make many Churches one Church to a company of Elders, that they may Govern them; and in relation to them as representers of the Church, they must be called one Church. What tho' the Old Testament frame, or Language be urged, we grant there was then a Church representative, but the Gospel knows no such now.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Surely a setled Congregation of Saints deserveth the name of Church more, and suppose places could be found in Scripture, where it is taken both for Elders and the People apart, yet those meetings that have both Elders and People of both sorts, must needs have more of Church in them. We can give instances that the Disciples apart are called the Church in distinction from the Officers. You cannot give one instance where the Officers are called the Church in distinction from the Disciples. Certainly those that have the Power have the Name, and not those only that have the name Equivocally or Metaphorically.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A Presbyterial Church is called a Church in relation to the People of those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations by their own confessions when they interpret the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to be many Congregations (and the Presbyterial's Argument is built thereon) and that the People of all those Congregations make one Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that one Eldership. Now it is strange that they should have a Name of Church only as they are the subject or object of Discipline, and yet not so much as meet for that discipline actually neither, for so they cannot in a Presbyterial Church. The poor people of those Churches have no communion of Saints together herein, but such as they hold with all other Churches that are not under the same Presbytery; and yet they are according to Presbyterial principles in their Officers (as representing them) a distinct Church classical from all Churches else. So they make use of the name from the People, when the People enjoy not the thing. The poor Church of <hi>Hierusalem, Acts</hi> 8. 1. (when it is said that the Church was scattered) affords you an argument that therefore there was but one Church for Discipline in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and in that respect it is called one Church; when yet the scattering was not upon the Presbyterial Church that exercised Discipline, but upon the People. They were not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:154381:40"/> in the representative body persecuted, and yet tho' they were scattered as a Church personally, and not representatively, and persecuted as a Church personally, not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatively only, yet according unto the Presbyterian Principles they never met as a Church personally, but only representatively.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that the People in Classical Assemblies may meet. Yet it is no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than the People in the next Classes, which if they will may come thither, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they all possibly. You lay no more obligation on them to be present than you do upon the People of the next Classes. And therefore in that respect the People of that particular Classes, are no more of that Church than those of other Neighbouring Presbyters.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Those Assemblies must have more of Church in them, not only that have both Elders and People, as Congregations have: but that have constant Worship in them as well as government, And our Presbyterians allow some Government to Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Elders of Congregations. Worship is the chief end of a Church. The formal notion of a Church is to meet and communicate in worship, and where there can be no Church-fellowship and Communion to the edification of the whole, there cannot be a Church. Which may be illustrated by the natural body, to which still Instituted Churches in Scripture are compared. The Eye, the Hand, the Head, they serve to several uses in the body, yet they are so united as they are all nourished with the same individual nourishment, and from the same stomach, and therefore this is a several body having all these parts, from another body. So is it here in the Churches instituted, they are such as have a communion in all the common Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, not only in the same kind, but in the same ordinances individually in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant way. And the Analogy of the Church universal, and the Churches particular will help to illustrate this further, for the Church Universal being one body, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fed by one kind of Ordinances, as there is one Body, so there is one Baptism for kind. But the particular Churches which are Instituted, are such bodies as are fed with one and the same individual Baptism, and one and the same individual Lord's Supper, and so are one Bread. In a word, then all can come to those Classical Churches, or they cannot come; if they come then they are to make one Church for Worship too: If they cannot come, then there cannot be a fellowship for the edification of the whole, and when the Communion of Saints cannot be exercised, how can that be a Church? Every Church is a Temple, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>The Temple of God are ye;</hi> Now the Temple did chiefly relate to Worship, and was the subject of all Ordinances, and the place where the <hi>Synedrim</hi> sat too. Answerably under the New Testament, the Preaching of the Gospel is called serving at the Altar, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. So 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. The Saints <hi>are built up to offer Sacrifices.</hi> God's House is called an House of Prayer. The Church is called a body to Christ, <hi>one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and one Bread</hi> (as was said afore) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. because they partake of one Bread. But none of these do belong to a Presbyterial Church, they may pray occasionally, but the Ordinance of Prayer, and constant Worship is not there. Publick Worship lies in a Communion, therefore it is to be only with those that can enjoy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion together. Yea it is made the very definition of a Church in the Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which Article we hope will never be changed, <hi>Ecclesia est nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus fidelium</hi> (so others also define it) <hi>in cultu Divino &amp; Disciplina Communicantium. The Church is a number of Believers communicating in Divine Worship and Discipline.</hi> which a Presbyterial Church is not. The end of a Church is that God may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Worshipped, he would not have Instituted Churches else, but principally for that, therefore he had Congregations to do it, in which only it is done; and of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline superadded, is but to keep that kind of Worship pure, for Government is but casting out of the Body impure Members: And therefore the great Ordinance of Discipline, of Excommunication, is when they are met together, then they are to cast out from amongst them. As the intent of it is but to keep the Worship pure, so answerably it is to be exercised then when they meet to Worship, but Presbyterial Churches meet not for Worship, but Discipline only. Now as the Body is ordained for Meat Principally and Nourishment, and is not ordained for Physick but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally, so it is as to the state of the Church, and therefore our Divines make the Essential notes of a Church to be the Word, Sacraments, and Discipline; but in these Presbyterial Churches, the Word, and Sacraments are Wanting, and there is only Government. The General Assembly of the Saints in Heaven, is a Church in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154381:41"/> unto Worship, and tho' there is no Discipline there, yet they are never more a Church than when they are there. And the Apostle also speaking of the Church in the New Testament, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. saith, that <hi>Now there is an House of God, because there is an High Priest as well as before,</hi> ver. 21. and therefore (saith he) <hi>let us draw near</hi> (he speaks of publick Worship) <hi>not forsaking the assembling of our selves together,</hi> ver. 25. and that in <hi>Synagogues,</hi> for so the Word signifies. And therefore in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. as Discipline so prayer is meant, and unto that is the Promise of Christ to be in the midst of them more peculiarly made, and upon occasion of that. And indeed it were exceeding strange that seeing the chief end of Churches, (which are Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations) is for Worship, and that's the great business for which they are appointed, that if there were many Congregations in those of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and those of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and the like, as is pretended, that there should not be mention of those many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, under the names of Churches, but that Discipline only must carry away the denomination of their being one Church, though many in relation unto it. If there were one word in any of those instances, that there were many Churches among them making one Church, it were something, but there is not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 If such a Presbyterial company of Elders were a Church, then Discipline must merely constitute a Church as a Church. And so the objection against the Episcopal Government, <hi>viz.</hi> That for Government alone there was an Order of Priesthood, namely a Bishop; will come with greater force here, as being very strange that for Government alone, there should be a Church Instituted. And that Discipline doth never constitute any kind of Church is clear, because that which can <hi>abesse be</hi> or not, and <hi>adesse be,</hi> without the destruction of the subject, will never constitute it. But so all Divines do say of Discipline, that a Church may be a Church though it be defective in Discipline, therefore it is not that which doth constitute a Church. And this principle the Church of <hi>England</hi> is concerned to hold up, or else they will justifie separation from them, as having been hitherto no true Churches. But lo here is a Church, a Presbyterial Church, that is a Church upon no other consideration but for Discipline.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And add to this, that since Presbyterial Government makes Congregations (which are Churches, having each their Elders over them) to be united for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto one Presbyterial Church: Let us but consider how many several Churches it makes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For first, There is the particular Congregations consisting of People and their Elders for Worship, they are one sort of Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is secondly the Eldership in every one of those Congregations, which according to their principles is the Church, for they interpret <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. to be, Tell that Eldership, that is, Tell the Church; there's a second sort.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then thirdly, There is all these Elders met in one for the Government of any of these Congregations; There's a third sort of Churches; for these Elders must be a Church in a true sense for the People, or they cannot meet: And if they will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge Government by virtue of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. they must needs challenge to be a Church. Now let it be considered, that those are not so much subordinations, as National and Provincial (which are but subordinations of the same kind, for the same ends) which consists of greater or lesser number of Elders; but these are diversifications, several sorts of bodies going to make up one Church that it might be a compleat both for Worship and Government. And that it is a diversification is clear by this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because they are Churches for differing purposes. The Congregations are Churches for Worship, but the particular Elderships and Presbyterial Elderships, are only for Discipline; now ends do diversifie such bodies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are not the same Churches by way of Accumulation, as many things of the same sort laid together: which is clear by this, because the particular Churches consist of People and Elders, but these have Elders of Churches only. And as we urge in our Argument that is drawn from Elders, that this Presbyterial Government would make one Man to be a double sort of Elders, both a Ruling Elder and a Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elder, a Ruling Elder to some Churches, and a Teaching Elder to others, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so this makes them several sorts of Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It must needs make a diversification of Churches. For as when many Families unite into a City for Government, there is a new relation and notion; so now here, there is the notion of a new Church. And then,</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:154381:41"/> 4. Add to this (which heighteneth the absurdity of it) that whereas the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Church is made the compleat Church, they yet do want those great and main Ordinances, for which principally a Church is said to be a Church, as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the like. So of the two, this greater Church is the less compleat, and therefore is less the Church than a particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p>And if you say, they are made compleat Churches by being both, yet you make at least wise two sorts of Churches, as we said before: And you make a whole Church more uncompleat, as it is the whole, than it is in the parts.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that the Church Universal is one, and yet hath no Ordinances as Church, as Preaching the Word and Sacraments, and yet it is truly a Church. We answer, it is not a Church Instituted in relation unto Ordinances; but a Church Mystical in relation unto Persons and Personal Graces.</p>
                  <p>This also farther addeth confirmation to us, that the supposition of there being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations, in all, or many of those Cities, under a common Presbyterian Government of many Elders, thus in the general only held forth, leaveth room for, yea is the occasion of a variety of suppositions of several frames and forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which those Congregations might be cast into, both in relation to their Officers, and to the Members mutually among themselves. 1. As that either they were <hi>Conventus promiscui</hi> (as <hi>Didoclavius</hi> calls them) <hi>promiscuous unfixt Assemblies,</hi> some meeting together at one place or time, some at another time with others, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no fixed relation; Or else that they were fixed meetings in respect of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers divided into set determinate companies meeting constantly together. 2. Or else otherwise, supposing them set and fixed Congregations in respect of the Members, yet there are other as various and more difficult suppositions may still be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the relation of these Officers and Elders, how they were disposed of to the right performance of their duties, which the command of the Word lays on them toward their Flock. As, whether they were either fixed and appropriated to these several Congregations respectively, some to one, some to another (as it is in most of the Reformed Churches, and is with us, and we suppose will not be altered amongst us) or else unfixt in respect of all the Congregations, so as equally and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in their course, these Ministers might Preach and Officiate to them all by turns (as in some Cities in <hi>Holland.)</hi> And then 3 If you suppose them fixedly divided into several Congregations, then another question cometh, what power those Elders that are appropriated to each Congregation should have over the Flock? Whether over all, or none, or some part? Now it is the supposition of their being many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations under one Presbytery, that only is the ground of this uncertainty, and bringeth in this variety of suppositions of these several ways, how these things should be cast, whereas the supposing of them to be but several distinct Churches tho' great ones, will make all things fall in naturally. For then there could be but one way of casting and moulding Members, nor could there be but one common relation of Elders, and so all those duties and things that are spoken about the Power and Duties of Elders, and of the Members amongst themselves, and whatsoever is spoken of Churches and Elders, their Dues, and Duties run all but in one Channel. And then consider too (supposing them many Congregations) that the designing out, which of those suppositions was the pattern left by the Apostles, was a matter of as much moment (as touching the point of the right ordering of Congregations) as this common Presbyterial Government can be supposed to be of, in as much as the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of all mutual duties between People and Pastors, and the administration of all holy things amongst them, appertaining to this particular Government of the several Congregations, and upon the right ordering and settlement of them, and of these Elders relation to them, doth the right Government and Administration of all holy things depend. And yet consider too at the same time, that we do not find the Holy Ghost making so much as a mention of any such distinct subordinated Congregations to a Classis (only the multitudes of Believers are looked upon through multiplying Glasses to argue it) much less giving any hints to discern by, in the History of the Apostles, or in the Epistles, what the frame was of these supposed Churches, and what their particular special relation to Elders in this supposed variety was. There is not any thing to any such purpose extant, in either that instance of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> or any other of those examples of Cities, that are pretended to hold forth this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Congregations making one Church under one Common Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:154381:42"/> This hath long and doth still stick in our Consciences because the Holy Ghost is silent, and hath not left us the least footsteps in the Sacred History, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in which of these ways (supposing many Congregations thus making a Church for Government) the Apostles did settle the constitution of this Church, and how they did dispose the relation of these Elders and Officers to those several Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

And is this their diversification and title of Churches. like to have been in a Classical respect or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational, as here he speaks of them generally? Let the words and circumstances of the story be considered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was in the beginning of the Gospel, that these Churches had been raised, and the special means we read of whereby they were erected, was <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry, of whom we read, <hi>chap</hi> 8. 25. that <hi>returning to Hierusalem, they preached the Gospel in many Villages of the Samaritans, as also some of the dispersed from Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem had done,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>They went every where</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>they went thorough or all about,</hi> namely <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> as <hi>Philip</hi> in <hi>Samaria,</hi> ver. 5. And as their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had been every where, and in Villages, which is chiefly noted, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Churches that were constituted out of those converted, are said to have been in all <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore in Villages. For that the Holy Ghost should aforehand in the <hi>Acts,</hi> so remarkably relate their Preaching in many Villages of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and then make mention of Churches throughout <hi>Samaria,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues his intent to have been to shew that these Churches were those in these Villages: And these not as gathered into Cities, but remaining thoroughout <hi>Samaria,</hi> as the Gospel had been Preached in the Villages. Nor needed they now (for they had rest) for bear to hold up their Church-fellowship in the several places of their abode. And therefore when upon this rest, <hi>Peter</hi> took the opportunity to visit them (as in the next verse of that <hi>9th chapter,</hi> it is said <hi>Peter passed thorough all,</hi> namely as 'tis tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, <hi>all quarters</hi> where these Churches were scattered, some here, some there, up and down) all of them whether in Cities or in Villages, are in one uniform respect called <hi>Churches,</hi> for his Speech wherein he involves them all promiscuously is <hi>simular,</hi> and so meant of the same kind of Churches. Now is it imaginable that throughout these Regions or Countreys, the Churches whereof he speaks should all be such Classical Churches as are now amongst us, when at the beginning of the Gospel, but a few Saints and Professours of Christianity can be supposed to be scattered every where up and down. It was well if by reason of their being so thin sown up and down in those Regions they could make up Congregational Churches with Elders to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When it is said that these Churches had rest and were edified, is it likely he should speak this of these Churches as Classical, as such which meet but in their Elders for exercise of Discipline; Or rather of these Churches as enjoying rest in the Ordinances of Worship on the Lord's Day, publick Prayers, the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all other means of edification and comfort? For the preservation of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:154381:42"/> purity of which, Discipline doth but subserve. They are the Congregational Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the Communion the Saints have therein, that are the great means of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, Edification, and Multiplication of Churches; and the enjoyment of these, in rest, is that which is the greatest outward Mercy and Priviledge. And therefore when he sets out the condition of those times; <hi>Then had the Churches Rest, and were Edified,</hi> he means, Congregational Churches. And when he says the Churches were multiplied, which if understood, of more and New Churches Erected: Doth he reckon their Multiplication by Presbyterian Churches, that do consist of many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations each of them? It is likely a Multitude of many more such Churches were erected? No, rather they were so many fixed Congregations of Believers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us come to the next mention of Churches in that Story, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. (slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping over that Church of <hi>Antioch, chap.</hi> 13. The Demonstration of which, to have been a Congregational Church, we refer to another place, when we examine the State of Churches in Cities.) <hi>And when they had Ordained them Elders in every Church; and had Prayed with Fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> That these were Congregational Churches, will appear in like manner by the like circumstances of the Story. In <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 14. We Read that <hi>Paul</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany came to <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pisidia,</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> refusing the Gospel, <hi>Lo we turn to the Gentiles,</hi> said <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> ver. 46. <hi>For so the Lord hath commanded us, I have set thee to be a light of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that thou shouldest be for Salvation, to the ends of the Earth, and many believed;</hi> and accordingly, ver. 48. and ver. 49. <hi>The word of the Lord was published throughout the Regions.</hi> Then <hi>chap.</hi> 14. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> fled to <hi>Derbe</hi> and <hi>Lystra,</hi> Cities of <hi>Lycaonia;</hi> and <hi>unto the Region that lieth round about, and there they Preached the Gospel.</hi> Here again as afore in <hi>Pisidia,</hi> so now in <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> not in Cities only, but in the Regions they Preached. And this is noted, to shew the spreading of the Gospel, (for to what end else, should the Preaching of it be Recorded?) And <hi>ver.</hi> 21. 'tis said, that when at <hi>Derbe</hi> they had Taught <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>a sufficient competent number in that City;</hi> they went again to <hi>Lystra, Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Antioch,</hi> the chief Cities of those Countries, <hi>Lycaonia</hi> and <hi>Pisidia,</hi> in the Regions of which they had preached the Gospel, as well as in those Cities. And the Story Relates, that the end and purpose of this second visit of these places, was to confirm the Disciples, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and to gather them into Churches, and ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders over them, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. whom they had afore Preached unto, and made Disciples. Thus they made fit matter for Churches, by making Disciples, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. and then moulded and formed them up, into a way of order for Worship and Government, by Elders Established, in the several Congregations. For these Churches, they thus Formed and Ordained Elders unto, were surely Congregational. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we suppose them to have been only the Disciples in these Cities of <hi>Lystra</hi> and <hi>Derbe, Iconium,</hi> and <hi>Antioch;</hi> yet it is not supposable, that in each the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Disciples should arise to more than one Congregation in a City; now in this beginning of the Gospel, and in so short a time; and yet they were formed up into Churches, and had Elders in every Church. Or</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Can we suppose, that the Apostles staid gathering them into those Churches with Elders, till their number would arise to many Congregations in each City, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to make Classical Churches; and that they did not till then, constitute them Churches, nor placed Elders over them? Can it be imagined, they would keep Men out of Ordinances so long? Or that themselves, being Apostles, and to sow the Gospel in the World, would still stay so long, till every where such Members did arise? Yea,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The 21. <hi>verse</hi> intimates, (in the instance of <hi>Derbe)</hi> their manner to have been, (and as there, so in other places) that when they had Preached the Gospel to that City, and had Taught many, (or as the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, made a sufficient and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of Disciples, and sufficient for what? <hi>ver.</hi> 23. to make up a Church, and whereof some might be fit Persons for Elders therein;) then they used to leave that City, and went to other places, as there 'tis said they did; and so long to stay there, till there were a sufficiency for a Church and Elders, or if before they could accomplish this, they were driven out, then they either returned to Form them into Churches with Elders, (which was their end of coming this second time to <hi>Lystra,</hi> and those Cities, to confirm the Disciples, and ordain them Elders, as now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Church) or else afterwards sent <hi>Evangelists</hi> to them.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:154381:43"/>
                  <p> And 4. As those Disciples were in the Regions about, as well as in the Cities; for (afore it was noted in the Story, that in the Regions about both of <hi>Pisidia</hi> and <hi>Lycaonia,</hi> the Gospel was Preached) so it must be supposed, that these Churches were set up in the Countries about, as well as in the Cities. And 'tis hard to think, that all the Christians should leave their Callings and Dwellings they were bred and born in, to come up to the Cities to make Classical Churches, or that they were so many converted in the Villages, as to make Classical Churches there. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10. that he ordained in all Churches, that Men should abide in the callings wherein God called or converted them in; and to suppose that Husbandmen in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, should leave their callings of Husbandry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and come up to the Cities, where they could not exercise that calling, to leave their Livelihood; and Wives conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to leave their Husbands, Children their Parents, Servants their Masters; and come to dwell in the Cities only, and not rather have Churches made up in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries also, is hard to think. But,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And Lastly. These could not be Classical Churches here; but Congregational, for it is the first Ordaining of these Elders, to these Churches that is here mentioned, and not an <hi>Associating</hi> of many Congregations into one Eldership; and therefore here is a gathering Congregational Churches, and ordaining Elders thereunto apart, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> And as there must be a sufficient company of Christians, ere a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church is made up, as a number of Congregations with Elders must be supposed, ere a Classical Church can be framed. This being therefore the first fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them into Churches, and ordaining them Elders, (or else you must suppose Churches, long afore they had Elders) it must be in a Congregational way. And further also, there is this Reason; That these Congregations being then fixt for Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Elders, if these Elders were ordained to these Churches, their ordination, as Elders, must be to their several Churches Respectively; and not as the common Eldership made up of them. And such were called Churches, endowed with El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders proper unto them; and so much the word (that is added in that, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 13.) doth import, <hi>they ordained or chose</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>to them Elders in every Church,</hi> that is, to every Church they chose their own proper and peculiar Elders, fixed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto them.</p>
                  <p>That this was the primitive way of planting the Gospel, may further be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Parallel place to this, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. where there being many Believers already converted, (as many passages in that Epistle do argue) and yet not in most places, formed up into Churches with Elders; the Apostle left <hi>Titus</hi> an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> (whose proper Office it was, as appears by the Epistle; and that to <hi>Timothy</hi> to settle Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers and Churches in their right frame and order, according to the Apostle's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections given) to ordain Elders in every City or Town, (as shall be shewn by and by) where any number of Believers were to make a Church; and where fit and meet Men for Elders might be found, to set over those Churches. And that which <hi>Luke,</hi> in the forecited, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. calleth <hi>Ordaining Elders in every Church, Paul</hi> here calleth, <hi>Ordaining Elders in every City;</hi> and the one interprets the other: And the Apostle's, practice there, is here turned into a command or direction, as given to <hi>Titus,</hi> which therefore as it bound him, binds us to the end of the World; And he adds, <hi>as I appointed thee.</hi> Now his meaning is, not that Elders should be ordained in every City simply, as it was a City or Body of Men; for Elders and Church, were Relatives, as Shepherd and Flock, and therefore Elders were not ordained, but to a Church; and therefore to say, he ordained Elders in the City, necessarily supposeth, a Church extant in that City, unto which these Elders were ordained; and therefore the ordination was only in such Cities or Towns, where a Church was, and a competent sufficient number of Believers to make a Church. For that must needs be the reason, why <hi>Paul</hi> himself did not cast and mould these People in <hi>Crete,</hi> converted by him presently into Churches with Elders, as fast as they were converted; because a Church should have a convenient competent number, and fit Men to be Elders unto them, before they be form'd into such a Body. And therefore, he being called away too soon, he left <hi>Titus</hi> behind him, to finish that Work.</p>
                  <p>The Writers for <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> have made use of this place, to shew, that in the Apostle's times, they planted Churches only in Cities; (and 'tis certain, that they bestowed their pains chiefly therein) So that they make the Apostolical Institution to be, that look how many Believers soever were in a City, and the Villages about
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154381:43"/> it, so many were to make one Church-Diocesan for Government; and therefore to ordain Elders, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in every Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. is all one, and to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Elders <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in every City as here, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. and this by the Apostle's own Ordination, <hi>as I appointed thee. i. e.</hi> over these Cities, and so the Churches therein, and the vicinity thereof, he as one Man, was as a Bishop set. And some of those for the Classical Government, do make use of of the same Notion, that all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in a City, when multiplied, were by Apostolical Institution, to be but one Church for Government, as well as at first, when they were but one Congregation; and the Elders, at first planted in that first Church, were still to continue, together with all the Elders, that should anew be set over those Churches) as one Eldership, a Presbytery, unto them in that City as one Church. The appearances for this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we shall speak to, when Arguments for the Presbyterial Government, come to be discussed. In the mean time as to this place, if we Interpret it by that former, and consider all circumstances, it makes for Congregational Churches and Elderships over them. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Direction was given to <hi>Titus,</hi> now in the first beginning of the Gospel in <hi>Crete;</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> having newly been there with him, and having converted many up and down in the <hi>Island,</hi> he left <hi>Titus</hi> behind, to ordain them Elders: So as here was the first Erection of Churches and Elders; and therefore 'twas in the beginning of the Gospel, at which time all the Saints, in each great City converted, were but as many as might make but one Church. And it was the Duty of Saints, that all the Saints, in a place cohabiting, should joyn in one, rather than in divers companies for Worship, and all Ordinances; and not divide, both because of Unity, and more presence of the Spirit, and the Solemnity of the Worship; and for all these ever to continue one Church, till absolute necessity, would cause a division into many: Hence in this beginning of the Gospel, he writes to him to ordain Elders in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because his ordination was, that Saints cohabiting, should make one Church, and not divide for all ordinances; and that they should have Elders, more than one, set over them, both for Worship and Government; because <hi>de facto,</hi> there were but so many in the greatest Cities, as would make but one Church. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This being Interpreted by the form, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> City, here therefore is not meant literally, the extent of a City; but Metonimically it is put for the Church, then extant in any City; and so doth not necessarily import, that the extent of the Church-Government, should be by God's Ordidinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, equal to the extent of the City; as if because there were in a City, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as would make more Churches, he was to ordain them Elders, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in every Church in those Cities, as the Apostle had done; for they were not to be El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to that City, as a City, but to the Churches in that City; and as Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Churches are meant, in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. so also they here intended. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And chiefly, as Church by Church, in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. was not in Cities only, but in Villages, or Market Country Towns, so here also, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is to be understood: For the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> when indefinitely used, (as here) is taken not for great Cities only, but Country Towns. And accordingly in the New Testament, when the Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Propagating the Gospel is mentioned, the business here spoken of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned) we find that when the Commission to Preach the Gospel, is given to the Apostles and Disciples, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is taken for Villages, as well as great Cities, as being those they were sent to preach unto, as indifferently and promiscuously, as to Cities; and therefore when like directions are given to frame Churches, and set up Elderships over them, (as here) it is answerably to be taken. Thus in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission given, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 11. whereas Christ says, <hi>Into what City or Town ye enter;</hi> the <hi>Evangelist Luke</hi> says, <hi>chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. (uttering the same Commission) <hi>Into what City ye enter;</hi> that word therefore is put for all and both; and therefore he useth a general indefinite word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Into what ever City ye enter;</hi> that is, City of any sort or kind, small or great, as intending Towns, as well as Cities strictly so called. And further, he, in his Speech, useth it as the Contra-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Term to <hi>House</hi> or Family, of which he had said before, <hi>into what House ye enter;</hi> so now into what City, and therefore intended to take in all sorts of Towns, consisting of more Families than one. And the practice of the Twelve Apostles, who had received Commission, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. interprets it, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. 'tis said, they went <hi>through Towns, Preaching the Gospel,</hi> where the word <hi>Towns</hi> is only used, as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:154381:44"/> Cities, as in <hi>Luke</hi> the word Cities only is used, as including Towns; and so the one promiscuously is put for the other: For in the preceding verse, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Christ in his Commission given, calls them Cities, <hi>when ye go out of a City</hi> (says he) <hi>where you have Preached, shake off the dust;</hi> and then in the execution of this Commission, they are called Towns, <hi>they went through the Towns Preaching, ver.</hi> 6. And further in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 23. when Christ teaching them if, they were persecuted where they Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to fly; if they persecute you in one City, fly into another; that is, if persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one Town, fly into another: What, were they persecuted only in great Cities? Yes in Towns, for they were whipt in Synagogues, and Synagogues were in Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 33. And is the direction given to them, to fly into smaller Towns, if they might be safe there as well as into Cities, or there only were they to have the promise of protection? so <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 6. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> fled to <hi>Derbe</hi> and <hi>Lystra,</hi> and the Regions about, as well as to the Cities; and there had safety, and Preached the Gospel. And Christ further adds in that place, <hi>you shall not have gone over</hi> all the Cities of <hi>Israel, &amp;c,</hi> that is, the Towns, for in Towns they Preached. And so Christ himself Preached in all Cities and Towns, and so did the Apostles, and it was their Commission so to do.</p>
                  <p>And it seems there was something special in the state and condition of <hi>Crete,</hi> why the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> should be there used, <hi>Crete</hi> is but a small Island, and there are at this day, but three Cities in it. In the Apostle's times, there were four Hundred Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for so <hi>Pliny,</hi> (who lived not long after them relates) said to have been in it, which were but small Towns. And therefore <hi>Beza</hi> hath Translated it, <hi>Oppidatim,</hi> Town by Town, as also so understanding it.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore if the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, be indefinitely taken for Country Towns, as well as great Cities, when Commission was given to Preach the Gospel; why should it not be taken also in that Sense, when Direction is given to make up Churches, and Ordain Elders to them, in the same place where it hath been Preached? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ordain Elders, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is not to be confined to Cities only, (where many Congregations, as is supposed, have been) but in Country Towns, or very small Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (when in <hi>Crete</hi> there were so many) where Churches may be supposed to have been; and those to be sure but Congregational, and in both such Cities and Towns only, where Churches and Saints <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> sufficient to make Churches were found. So there <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Church by Church, Acts</hi> 14. 23. are all one. And if in greater Churches, there were more than one Elder, then their Elders were ordained <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>And surely it is a hard Supposition, to suppose that in <hi>Crete</hi> the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> the <hi>Evangelist,</hi> had Preacht only in the Cities, when the Commission was to Teach all Nations; and therein Towns as well as Cities, as they had occasion. Was God's Elect in Cities only? And were not Country Souls as pretious? And if they be converted unto God, were not they to be Taught to do what Christ commanded, as well as those in Cities? And to become Churches, and to have the priviledge of all Ordinances? Or were they to come up to the Cities for them, and to the Elders there, as the Tribes did for Judgment to <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> These are harder Suppositions, than what the Presbyterians put upon us, as an Absurdity, that the fruit of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's Preaching, should in great Cities arise to the conversion but of so many, as to make but one Congregation.</p>
                  <p>And besides, if <hi>City</hi> should here <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. be taken strictly for greater Cities, then here is no Commission to <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain Elders to Churches elsewhere. And so then the Institution of the bounds of a Church, and the extent of the Jurisdiction of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, should be cast rather to the mould and extent of great Cities; that if one City, then one Church, one Eldership, though there were never so many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in it; and thus Elders in every City, is to be understood of greater Cities, then not of the Churches in Towns and Villages, where there could rationally be but one Church in a Town. But why the pattern of Church Government should fall upon, and be framed rather to the example of a City, and so conformed to the mould of the Civil Government in Cities especially, and not as well upon the way of Country Towns, when <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> will import the one, as well as the other; (and the pattern surely was uniform in both) we see no ground of Reason for difference. Why should we imagine that the Apostle should still so have in his Eye in these Directions to <hi>Titus,</hi>
                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:154381:44"/> Classical Presbyteries, (which are but the external Government of the Church) as to take care of the ordaining Elders, as in Relation hereunto, and not much rather for the ordaining Elders in order to the Worship of God in Churches, and for the Establishment of their Relation of Elders to Congregations or Churches.</p>
                  <p>Let us go on from these forementioned, to all other that are either called Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or where the Saints, written to by the Apostles, may by circumstances be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have been gathered into Churches, under Elders and Officers.</p>
                  <p>In the Epistles of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> written to the scattered <hi>Jews,</hi> we find mention of Elders; and therefore there must be supposed Churches, whereof they were El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and we find indeed mention of <hi>Elders of the Church;</hi> and let the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances be considered, whether those may be more rationally supposed Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or Classical. Let us consider their condition.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were <hi>Jews</hi> scattered, and as some probably conceive, were many of them of those scattered, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. And as such, both of these Apostles did write to them; and as scattered up and down throughout vast Regions, whole Countries, <hi>Asia, Bythinia, Cappadocia,</hi> and therefore not thick sown, (being Strangers) nor in Multitudes, living so near, that they can be supposed to have made Associated Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those scattered Persons, therefore must rationally be supposed to have made up Churches of themselves, as those of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Strangers do in <hi>London,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> and not to have promiscuously mingled themselves with those Natives of the Countries, they were scattered into; for they had a differing Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though turned Christians. And this we find in <hi>Aquila &amp; Priscilla,</hi> who being <hi>Jews,</hi> and having had a Church in their House, (namely of <hi>Jews)</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>chap.</hi> 16. of that Epistle. And afterward the <hi>Jews</hi> being Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Rome Acts</hi> 18. 2. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> removed, but kept their Church together still distinct, from the Native <hi>Asiatique</hi> Christians; therefore in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. we read of the Church at their House in <hi>Asia,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s some think at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and there joyned or mentioned with the rest of the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> in <hi>Paul's</hi> Salute unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and is mentioned apart from them; because it was a Church of <hi>Jews,</hi> Strangers scattered among them, and kept distinct from them. And yet it was such a kind of Church (though less) that all those Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> made mention of together with it, were of (both that particular Church, and all the rest, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like spoken of promiscuously under the name of Church and Churches, as being all like Churches) and it will easily be granted, that that Church in <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>priscil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s House was Congregational, for it is an instance alledged by the <hi>Assembly</hi> at <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster</hi> of many Congregational Churches in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whereof that was one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. Now look as <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> and their fellow Strangers, kept a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Church of their Countrymen, (which is the reason that <hi>Church</hi> is in two Epistles so apart singly mentioned) so in like manner, did these scattered Strangers cast themselves into Churches of themselves, and their own Nation, distinct from the other Gentile Believers in the places where they came. And it was usual then for the <hi>Jews</hi> to have Synagogues for them of their Nation, in several Cities. And therefore both <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> writeth unto them apart as Strangers; and they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve not the mention of any Gentile Christians with them, because they themselves were apart from them. And yet they writ to these thus scattered and kept distinct, as to Churches that had Elders, <hi>The Elders that are among you,</hi> (says <hi>Peter)</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The phrase is of distinction, that as they writ to these <hi>Jews</hi> apart from the Christian <hi>Gentiles,</hi> so the Elders that are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Elders of you <hi>Jews,</hi> peculiar to you, that is, that belong to any of you. And therefore <hi>James, James</hi> 5. 14. also exhorts them that were sick among them, or of them to <hi>send for the Elders of the Church,</hi> not as if these had but one Church, for that was impossible, being scattered over so many Countries; therefore he speaks indefinitely, as giving a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection that they should send for the Elders of those Churches where they were; so as they had Churches and Elders. And these Elders must be considered (in that Speech) as Elders of Congregational Churches (as was afore observed) for how can it be imagined, that Men scattered so far off from one another, should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to send (when sick) for the Elders of a Church Classical, and such a Church and Elders, is common to such Churches to be intended? The sick Persons could not send, but for Elders that were ready at hand; and therefore a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:154381:45"/> Church is meant and intended, and the Elders of it. And therefore farther in the second Chapter, the same Apostle <hi>James</hi> speaking in the like indefinite manner, <hi>if a Man come into your Synagogue,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

And what, in the <hi>5<seg rend="sup">th</seg>
                     </hi> chapter, he calls the Elders of the Church, here in the second he calls a Synagogue, calling their Assembly, (as 'tis well Translated) such. And these Elders of the Church, (which was a Phrase suited to the Greek Idiom) is in Analogical Phrase of Speech, or by way of Similitude, all one as to say, <hi>Rulers of the Synagogues</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> their Churches being Congregational, of as many as could meet to Worship, like as the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogues were; and their El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as their Rulers, and the Government of these Christian Synagogues of Christian <hi>Jews,</hi> like to the Government of those <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogues, that were scattered up and down out of <hi>Judea</hi> in <hi>Gentile</hi> Cities (whereof we so often read) which was an entire Government within themselves, for they were therefore called Rulers of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Synagogues. And according unto the Analogy of these Assemblies of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of theirs, with their Elders over them Synagogue-wise, is that in <hi>Peter,</hi> (who Writes to the same Persons) to be understood, 1 Pet. 5. 1, 2. <hi>Let the Elders among you feed,</hi> (by Preaching and Ruling) <hi>the Flock,</hi> (indefinitely taken as Synagogue in <hi>James,</hi> and for the several Flocks Respectively) And in that he Writes to them to feed by Preaching as by Ruling; and the same to do the one, that did the other, it falls in with the former Notion, that he means Congregational Elders, who as they are fixed for feeding by Preaching to one Flock, so they must be for Ruling also, or else these are divided in their extent, when yet the Precept both is alike given, and made of like extent. But of this hereafter.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the Account which the Scripture gives us of many Churches Established by the Apostles in one City, Demonstrates Congregational Churches to have been by the primitive Institution of Christ.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE now will go over all other Instances of Congregational Churches, as they appear setled by the Apostles in Cities.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Church of <hi>Colossians</hi> was but one, which is argued by this, 1. That the Apostle Writing to that Church, Writes to them as a whole Church; and also that their Ministers that were over this whole Church, were fixed Ministers unto them; And if so, then that whole Church could be but one Congregation, for he that is a fixed Minister, hath a Relation, for his Teaching, but to one Congregation. Now their chief Minister <hi>Epaphras</hi> was a fixed Minister to that Church, Col. 1. 7. <hi>who is for you a Faithful Minister of Christ,</hi> Col. 4. 12. Epaphras <hi>who is one of you.</hi> If there had been many Congregations, to one of which he had been fixed, he had been more that Congregations Minister, than all the rest; and his special relation had been to them, and therefore his Salutation would have been mentioned, as espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to his own Church, more than to all the rest of the Congregations, as his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Pains, (when constant among them) was more to that particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, than any other. Since therefore his Salutation is to all the <hi>Colossian</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, its evident that they were but one Congregational Church, whose Pastor he was. And again, the Apostle Writes to the whole Church, as those that had learned the Gospel of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who was <hi>for them</hi> a Faithful Minister: Now if <hi>Epaphras</hi> had been a fixt Elder to one Congregation, and there had been many more there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, that one Congregation had been the Congregation, who had comparatively learned the Gospel of him, more than all the Congregations besides; and <hi>Paul</hi> would not have Written thus indefinitely, and alike of all, if there had been many. For he had been a full Minister only to that Congregation he was fixt to, and properly theirs as concerning Communion, by way of Learning and Teaching, wherefore the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:154381:45"/> Apostle would have singled out that Congregation in his Speech from all the rest, if there had been more than one. And then as to their other Ministers, <hi>Archippas, Col.</hi> 4. 17. The Apostle enjoyns them to say to him, <hi>Take heed to the Ministry that thou hast received of the Lord, that thou fulfill it.</hi> Had he been a fixt Minister to one Congregation; and there had been many Congregations there, besides the main of his Ministy lying in his Preaching and personal watching over that one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he was fixt to, (for that which a Minister doth in ruling in common over all the Congregations, according to the Classical Suppositions, is the least part of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry) the Apostle would have singled out that Congregation, with whom he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed continually, as those that should have said to him, fulfill thy Ministry; because that they who were his constant Hearers, must needs be best, if not only acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with what the fulfilling of the main and constant part of his Ministry was, and with what were any neglects or defects therein. Seeing therefore he Writes to them thus indefinitely, in relation to their own Ministers, without any Distinction, it argues that they were but one Church, having these Elders fixt to them for Preaching and Government. And of this Church he saith, that for their Faith and Order, for their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Worship and Government, they were compleat, and his Heart was comforted as well in the one, as in the other, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2, 5. and he incourageth them to walk in both, according as they had received of Jesus Christ the Lord; and if so, then to keep that Order too, (which already they had) without any alteration, to which he would never have exhorted them, it had been their duty (when multiplied to more Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es) to enter into another different Order and Form of Government. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the Church of <hi>Philippi.</hi> The Apostle speaks of them in the beginning of the Gospel as a Church saying <hi>(Phil.</hi> 4. 15.) that <hi>in the beginning of the Gospel, no Church communicated to him by way of giving and receiving,</hi> but only them; and in the beginning of the Gospel, even in the greatest Cities, a Church was no more than could meet together in one. Now look what manner of Church they were at the first, he speaks of them as such still; and useth the same Stile, <hi>No other Church but you,</hi> saith he.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> is another that is to be considered. It was an intire Church, having Government within it self. For if it could have discern'd that controversie in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. and so had been capable of deciding it, it had power to have done it; and need never have sent to <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> They did not therefore as wanting power, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal thither as to a Court of Judicature, but only sent for Advice and Counsel in a difficult Case, wherein their Opinions disagreed. And the Church at <hi>Antioch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> should go to the Apostles at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to consult them about this question; and it was as one Church that they did thus Determine also of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and others, <hi>that for a whole year they Assembled themselves with the Church,</hi> or <hi>in the Church</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>and Taught much People.</hi> And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> relateth to Assembling together; so the kind of the Church, must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the kind of the Assembling; and if the Assembling was for Worship, then the Church in which they met, was a Congregational Church, which is the Seat for Worship; and we believe that none will say that many Churches are ever called one Church in respect of Assembling for Worship. But here that they Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled of Worship is plain; for they Assembled themselves in the Church, and Taught much People, now the Church in which there is Teaching, is a Congregational Church. And besides that, he saith it was <hi>in the Church</hi> (as the Greek hath it) not only <hi>with the Church.</hi> If there had been several Congregations in this City, where the word had been Taught, speaking of Assembling for Teaching, if ever, or at any time he would have mentioned those many Congregations, surely he would have done it upon this occasion, especially relating to matter of Fact, he would have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken distributively. For why should he call Congregations Churches upon other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (as often he doth) or in any other Relation, and not upon this; whereas the Relation here is purely Congregational, for it is for Teaching the Word and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? Again. 2. We read twice of the meetings of that Church together, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 27. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came back to give an account to those of <hi>Antioch,</hi> from whom they had been commended to the Grace of God, it is said, <hi>when they were come and had gathered the Church together, they rehearsed all that God had done by them;</hi> did they make the Relation to the Classical Elders only? Did not the Rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal concern all the People, as well as every Soul amongst them as any Sermon, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:154381:46"/> to shew how God had opened the Door of Faith to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they might glorifie God. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 30. it is said when they came to <hi>Antioch</hi> to deliver the Epistle from the Church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they gathered the multitude together, and at that time made a Sermon, an Exhortation to them; and he calleth this Multitude Brethren, ver. 32. <hi>They Exhorted the Brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</hi> Thus as the meetings in the Church of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> are, six or seven times mentioned to be in one; and the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> is here twice so mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We have an account of the Church of <hi>Troas.</hi> A Church they were, for they had Elders, and Elders they had, for they had the Sacrament; and it was at a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but in one place, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 70. And <hi>Paul</hi> staid there seven Days, till they met, <hi>They all met to break Bread,</hi> and all in one; for it was in an upper Room, where <hi>Paul</hi> Preached to them; and if there had been more Congregations than one, he would have Preached to one at one time, and to another at another time.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> (as they are Stiled 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1.) doth he mean Congregational Churches or Classical? Congregational only; for first, when he speaks of them, it is concerning Collection for the Saints, <hi>Even as I have given Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Churches of</hi> Galatia, <hi>so do ye;</hi> Now the Order for Collection, for the Saints, concerns Congregational Churches, not Classical; <hi>Let every one of you upon the first day of the Week, lay up in store as God hath</hi> prospered him <hi>(i. e.</hi> lay up in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Treasury of the Congregation) <hi>that there be no gathering when I come.</hi> And then, 2. If they had a provincial Church, he would certainly have called them so in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> but when (as we see there) those Churches were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with corrupt Doctrine; and he exhorts them to <hi>purge out the Old Leaven, Gal.</hi> 5. 9. he then Writes to them as to Churches that were apart, to purge out the Old Leaven, as the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> did; and each to become a new lump. If they be considered as one lump, yet it was as being leavened by way of infection; but that in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. is by way of guilt</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> mentioned in the Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> was also but a Congregational Church, <hi>Colos.</hi> 4. 16. when this Epistle is read amongst you, cause it to be read also in the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans.</hi> That Church, wherein reading of the Word is, is a Congregational Church, for reading is a Work of Worship. And if in other places he had ever called a Church, in relation to Government consisting of many Churches; yet here if there had been many Churches, and many Churches for Worship, he would have said so, and have thus expressed himself, <hi>Let it be read in the Churches of</hi> Laodicea. He would have spoke of the Duty, and of the Subject of the Duty in a suitable way. When he speaks of the reading of the Word among the <hi>Jews,</hi> he saith it is read in every Synagogue every Sabbath Day, he speaks distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and so he would have done here.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. I shall now proceed to prove that the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> were Congregational Churches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> was a Congregational Church, we refer to what hath been said.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Five of these <hi>Asiatick</hi> Churches even <hi>Downam</hi> acknowledgeth, not to have been in great Cities; and such are to be supposed probably to have but one Congregation, those smaller Cities containing but Christians, as made one Church in each of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The constitution of all those Churches for Worship and Government, was one and the same; and therefore if <hi>Laodicea</hi> and some of the rest, were but Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Churches, then all the rest were so too. For they are intended all as Types of all Churches to the end of the World, now if some of them had been Congregational Churches, and others had been Classical, they could not have suited the State and condition of all Churches, both Congregational and Classical, which have a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and a constitution different. And the Apostle <hi>Rev. chap.</hi> 2, &amp; 3. Writes to the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tacit. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. lib.</hi> 14.</note> Angels of those Churches, as having an intire Government among themselves; and he Writes to them about matters of Discipline, and therefore regards them as Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, for the Matter and Seat of Government. And if that be true, which some Historians have reported, that <hi>Laodicea</hi> was destroyed by an Earthquake in <hi>Nero's</hi> Reign, long afore the time of <hi>John's</hi> Writing the <hi>Revelation,</hi> then it must needs have been intended only as a Type. And that all these Churches were uniform, appears by this also; that in the closure of this Epistle, what he Writes to one Church, he
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:154381:46"/> Writes to all, <hi>Hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches,</hi> which is all one with the conclusion of the whole Book, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 16. <hi>He sent his Angel to Testifie these things in the Churches.</hi> And if Congregational Churches be acknowledged Churches in the Scripture Phrase, they must be intended in that Speech; and that those should be mainly intended appears by this, because that the Book of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> was only to be read in such Churches. And likewise that they were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Churches appears by this, that he Writes to them, as to the seven Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, which Christ walked in the midst of; and he threatneth them that he would remove the Candlestick. Now by Candlestick he interprets the Churches, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 1. And they are Candlesticks especially in relation to Worship. It was an Ordinance of Worship in the Temple: And it is therefore in <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 2. put for the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all the Temple for Worship, and all the utensils of it; for, though their <hi>Synedrim</hi> for Government might be compleat before, yet the Temple was not then built, in which God was to be Worshipped. And indeed the promise of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ is most in respect of Worship, which the Saints are most constant in. And when he threatneth to remove the Candlestick, certainly the chief threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning falls upon their Church-State, and the enjoyment of the Ordinances of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, such as Preaching, the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And whereas some would argue many Congregations to have been in every one of these Churches; Bishops have done so, because in the end of each Epistle he concludeth, <hi>Let them hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches,</hi> as having many Churches in each Church of them: We Answer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is a Speech all one with that in Rev. 22. 16. <hi>I have sent mine Angel to Testifie these things in the Churches;</hi> for as that is the closure of all, and is meant of all Churches, so this is the closure of each Epistle, and is meant by way of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all Churches in the World, he singling out seven for all the rest.</p>
                  <p>And 2. It is but such an indefinite Speech, as that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 29. If <hi>any have an Ear, let him hear,</hi> so here the meaning is, let every Church hear.</p>
                  <p>And 3. If that Notion be true of Mr. <hi>Brightman's,</hi> that they are Types of all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to come, to several Nations (as, it is most probable, they are) then it hath a clear other meaning, than that of their being many particular Churches, in each of those Cities.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we find that in all those Epistles of <hi>Paul,</hi> when he Writeth to the several Churches of <hi>Philippi, Colossus, Thessalonica,</hi> &amp;c. he Writeth to them most and chiefly, concerning the Duties, which lay upon them, in respect of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular relation, to that particular Congregation, whereof they are Members, and with whom they have a fixt communion, and do ordinarily converse with, both Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and People. Now if there had been more Congregational Churches, than one, in each of these Cities, (as is supposed) there is far more reason why he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have Written to them under the Stile of several Churches, in such a place (as he doth when he Writes to the <hi>Galatians)</hi> when he urgeth such Duties upon them, rather than to have given them the Title of one Church, in respect of an Association for Government only: If he had Written of matters of Government only, or chiefly to them, then the expression of calling them one Church, had been suitable to the Duties he exhorts them to; but the Duties principally concerning them, as they were Members of distinct Congregations, having a nearer communion both toward their Officers fixed to them, and the People fixt in a near communion with them, he would rather have used the Stile of Churches, than of one Church, if there had been many Churches in those Cities. And farther, since according to this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, the primary relation of Pastors to Churches, being in the several distinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; but the Relation of these Members one to another, as they are a Classical Church, being but a secondary relation, it were strange, that when the Holy Ghost Writes and speaks to such and such Churches, in such or such a City (supposing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) he should Write to them only under the Notion of a Classical Church, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that only, and not mention their other Church-State, as being several Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, making one Church, nay, not so much as speak, that they were several Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Since they are Churches Congregational in the Language of the Holy Ghost, and that the main of what is a Church (as hath been shewed) falls upon them as such; how can we think, that this Association, into one Church, which is a secondary thing, should wholly carry away and swallow up the Name, Stile and Title of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:154381:47"/> other. And that, which further strengthens this consideration, is, that when they Write to Churches, in a Nation or in a Province (as in <hi>Galatia,</hi> and in <hi>Asia,</hi> and in <hi>Judea</hi> and the like) if that a politick Association, (such or the like Association to this, whereby it is affirmed, that in one City, many particular Congregations are made one Classical Church for Government) If such a one were intended, then they would as well, and by the same reason (in Writing to such Churches in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Province) have Written to them under the notion of one Church, as well as when they did Write thus to them in a City. But the Apostle when he Writeth to a whole Province, then he saith Churches (although, according to Presbyterian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they are as truly one Church in the same political respect, that a Classical Church is one, in respect of many Congregations of a City) but on the contrary, when he Writeth to a City, he doth give them the Name of Church, Without the least mention of Churches therein, as making that one Church. And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is strong, that he should have done the one, as well as the other; For if many Churches were called one Church in a City, because that's the greater Association, whereby the lesser Churches were governed; by the same reason he would much rather have called the Churches of <hi>Judea</hi> one Church, because the Association, in a Province and a Nation, is larger and greater than that of many Congregations, in a Classical Church in a City.</p>
                  <p>And whereas some argue from the Multitude of Believers in a City, as too great to make but one Congregational Church. If the case had been so, it had been then more conducible for the Apostle to have exprest the Multitude in such Cities, by the Name of Churches in a City, than by calling them one Church. And it is strange, that when the Story is told of the Apostles coming to such or such a City (as in the <hi>Acts</hi> it is) it is still said they called the Church together, as when the People were called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 14. 27. For, if they had been many Congregations, and had met in parts by way of Distribution, it had been a much more proper Phrase, to say <hi>they called the Churches,</hi> if there had been more in such a City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> The Apostles still, in Writing unto the Saints in great Cities, calleth them one Church; and it were strange, if that, in the Apostle's times, they should not have multiplied in such great Cities, to more than one Congregation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As you say, it is hard to think that there were no Cities, that had but one Congregation; so it is as hard to think, that all the Churches, in other places, Villages and Cities, should not be uniform.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There might be some Cities, where there might be more Churches than one, to whom they Wrote, as the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> Wrote, might have more Churches than one; for he doth not, in all his Epistle, call the Saints there one Church; and though he speaks of a Church in <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi>'s House, yet his Phrase of Writing otherwise, is only to the Saints at <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. All those, that Write against Episcopacy, both of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Nation and of our own, have with one Mouth affirmed, that it cannot by manifest Argument be made out, that the Churches, mentioned in the New Testament, were more than could meet in one Congregation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The meaning is, that when the Story of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and those Epistles were written, that then there were no more, but not that afterwards there were no more.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Although the Apostles did specially Preach to Cities; yet let it be considered, how little time they were forced to stay in Cities, because they were to lay the Foundation of the Gospel in all the World. And though <hi>Paul</hi> staid three years in or about <hi>Ephesus,</hi> yet it doth not appear that he staid so long time in <hi>Ephesus</hi> it self, but as in the <hi>13th</hi> and <hi>14th chapter</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it is said they went into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, so likewise he did.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Apostles did teach the Saints in every City to become one Church, and to hold together so long as possibly they could continue in one Congregation with edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. And how great and large a Synagogue in a City was, we may see by that Instance of <hi>Capernaum.</hi> And the Christians met in the Cities, and built Synagogues for Meeting places, as well as the <hi>Jews</hi> were allowed to do in the Cities of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Constitution of a Congregational Church, Evidenced to be by the Wise Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, because it is so exactly accommodated to the various conditions of Saints.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>LET us now see, whether of these two should in reason be the Institution of Christ, and which, a Classical or Congregational Church would suit most with the condition of the Saints under the New Testament. God hath still moulded his Institution, and varied it himself according to what was the future condition of his Church Whilst the Church was continued in Families, as under the Old Law, he sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Government and Ordinances accordingly. When they grew up to a Nation, he fitted a New Government on purpose for them. When in the Wilderness, a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle only; when fully setled under a Kingly power, a Temple. Now under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the condition of Saints in Nations varying in several Ages, he hath framed his Ordinance of Church-State suitably.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that therefore when Churches should multiply to a Nation, then the Government is to be suited unto that Nation as such.</p>
                  <p>We reply, 1. When we see whole Nations truly turn Christian, an answer is to be given.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God saw it would fall out otherwise with his Saints in the New Testament, that they would still be Redeemed out of Nations, therefore still suited his Government to his own design.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If in his Providence he foresaw that Nations, being turned to him, should have an answerable Government as the <hi>Jews</hi> had, he would have given Rules answerable. As although the Church in the Wilderness was not given up to a Kingdom, and had not a set place for Worship; and was not come to be disposed of in several Cities, (as when they should inherit the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> they should) yet God, foreseeing what he would bring them to, did not give Laws only that suited their Church State in the Wilderness for the present, but he told them, that when they should come into <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> he would choose a place to which they should bring their Offering, that this should be the Law of their King, and also appointed what their Government should be, when dispersed into several Cities and Towns. And so answerably if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a National Form of Government, for his Saints under the New Testament, and all things suitable thereunto, (when as yet they were not grown up to National Churches) he would aforehand have prescribed Laws accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Now 1. This Institution of Congregational Churches, was such as would suit all times of the beginning of the Gospel, and of the continuance of the Gospel. The first Churches were such necessarily as was said afore, and when multiplied, did still continue so, and might govern themselves without Foreign Oppression.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It suits all places, Villages as well as Cities; and we must suppose Saints to be as well in Villages, as in Cities. And those Villages had Elders for Worship and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the rights of a Church. And if God were to make one uniform Law, why should the Institution be conformed to Cities, as is pretended, and that made the pattern, and the Jurisdiction of all the rest, rather than that of Villages; for God is the God of the Valleys, as well as the Hills; and there must be the same uniform Rule of both. But now, though the Institution, to have the Saints with their Elders make one Classical Church, might be supposed to suit Cities well enough (for it was but having many Churches in them) yet the lesser Towns it would not suit thus to form them up, under the Government of a Presbytery of many Congregations, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in those times when they were scattered.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Institution of Congregational Churches, suits also with all conditions of the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With the times of Persecution, as well as the times of Peace. I may say of this Congregational Government as of Faith; it is said of Faith, that it is a standing grace; it is the <hi>Materia prima, the first matter,</hi> out of which all riseth, and into which all resolveth. A Man liveth by it in Prosperity, and if he be in Desertion, all is resolved into it. And so it is of Congregations, it agrees with all Estates, with all times:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:154381:48"/> And though you suppose other Governments, yet that always existeth, and all begin from thence; therefore these are called <hi>Ecclesiae primae,</hi> and the other <hi>Ecclesiae ortae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It suiteth the condition of the Saints, being scattered all the World over. Whole Nations are not Saints fit for Churches, for the Saints are but a company redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of Nations. As therefore among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they were scattered, their Government was a Synagogue-Government, (therefore some think they began that of Synagogues, when they first went into <hi>Babylon,</hi> which we will not dispute) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as Synagogue-Government, suited with the scattered, the disperst condition of the <hi>Jews;</hi> so this suits best with the scattered condition of the Saints under the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The constitution also of Churches was certainly uniform in Cities, and in Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or wheresoever, or in what time soever, the Government of hem was uniform. When Christ bad them Teach every Nation, to do what he commanded them, he intended that the Rule should be uniform, whatever Government the Nations had, and therefore also the Apostle's Phrase and Stile is still, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 17. 17. <hi>So I ordain in all the Churches;</hi> and that which will suit all Churches, all States, all Times, is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly rather the Pattern than any other. Christ did not make one Form for Cities, and another for Villages; one Form for times of Persecution and another Form for times of Peace; for what suited times of Persecution, would suit times of Peace also: And as the Laws of Men, consider what is best for the generality of Men, so the Institutions of Christ considered, what was best for his Church of the New Testament, throughout all Ages, and all conditions and places whatsoever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It suits best for the condition of Churches in times, whether pure or corrupt, reformed, or to be reformed, when the Churches are generally overgrown with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By reason of this, that the Institution of Christ doth thus fall upon Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches, to be those Churches which should be the compleat Seat of Worship and Government; there was a provision made (and in the event hath fallen it out pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perously) that the Truth and the Substance of his Ordinances, and of Church-State, (taking it as it is it self a Ministerial Ordinance) and of the Ministry, might and hath continued in all Ages. For there being a necessity (if there should be any Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship at all) to have Congregations for to continue, and uphold the publick Worship of God; and to that end, to have Ministers over them to perform the Worship, in this Fundamental Institution of his, all that profess the Christian Name throughout the World in all Ages have agreed; and by this means, Jesus Christ hath preserved the Truth of a Church and Ministry, and Substance of Worship in the midst of all those varieties of Government of several sorts of <hi>Patriarchs, Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,</hi> in that <hi>Hierachical way,</hi> as also of <hi>General Councils,</hi> and other Assemblies Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to them; and so whatsoever false Superstructions have been made, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Interruptions; yet still this Fundamental constitution of his hath remained, and could not have been secured to continue in all Ages, (fall out what would) in any other way.</p>
                  <p>But the great thing, upon which all depends, is to find out what essential thing it is, that Church Institution should fall upon. We say, that the end of Churches is a fixed and immediate Communion of Saints, in all Ordinances; and that the Formal and External part of the Institution, is but suited so as to attain this end; which is, that Saints should be knit together, to meet in one for Ordinances, having their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers that have relation to them, by whom the Ordinances are externally dispensed. So as it is not an accidental thing, or meer external thing (as that they should meet in one place,) that the Institution falleth upon, but it is the most solid and substantial and essential thing, that can be supposed to be the ground of so great an Institution. We shall gradually make out the meaning of this assertion, by these following consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations; which will make the glory of Christ in this Institution, and the consenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neousness of it to Spiritual Reason, and the highest ends that may be supposed to be aimed at, to appear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Communion of Saints is the adequate end of a Church as such, be it what kind of Church soever; and therefore in the Creed, the Church Catholick, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints are joyned together, and do follow one another; for the one is the end of the other; and all particular Churches, are therefore also called the Churches
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:154381:48"/> of the Saints. And as the Church is framed and formed answerably, such is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; and such as the communion is to be, such is the Church to be rckoned, the one being suited to the other.</p>
                  <p>The Church Catholick, (as now it is called, in respect it is in all Nations) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is one Body to Christ; yet the Saints therein cannot have, as Saints, a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed standing set communion, but occasional; either occasional if outward, or secret and invisible if inward, such as the Church, in one Age, hath with the Church of a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nother Age that went afore, such as the Church now in Heaven, and in Earth may have together: And in that respect, an Ordinance or an Institution, could not so well fall upon it. But meet it was, that besides this kind of communion, there should be on Earth a communion of Saints, suited to the State of the Church whilst on Earth, that should be most entire, and the nearest that can be, and most resembling Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for the publick Worship and Glorifying of God in a common enjoyment of Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Under the Gospel, the communion of Saints is nearer and more intimate, than was under the Law, as the Church exceeded it, so the communion is to exceed it; and as their Ordinances are more Spiritual, so their communion. There is a greater distance of the Saints of the Church Catholick, in their Habitations under the Gospel, than of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Law. The <hi>Jews</hi> were nearer as People dwelling in one Land; and so were capable of a nearer communion all together, than the Church Catholick now is capable of; yet because it was a Nation, therefore their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was ordered in the way of a National polity, as a Government by Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, and a Representative Worship, wherein the Females, were Represented in the Males; and yet not frequent and often neither, for it was but three times a year. The communion therefore of Saints then was carryed on in a Worldly way, (as the State of Men in Kingdoms, and Common-wealths, and in Civil things is) and therefore it was a Worldly external Frame, and the communion answerable. And that of the Synagogues, was but for the reading the Word and Prayer only, and not for all sorts of Ordinances of Worship. The Catholick Universal Church, cannot attain to so general a communion under the Gospel, as the National Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> did, by reason of the difference of Language, and distance of places, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions into all Nations; and yet they were to attain to a nearer communion, and more intimate, and the entirest that the Saints on Earth are capable of; and so to have Churches framed, as to attain to this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The greatest and intirest communion that Saints are capable of, must therefore be by parts on Earth, to have communion in publick Worship and Ordinances. It is therefore necessary, that the Saints should be cast into such Assemblies, wherein they might partake of one Spirit by <hi>one Bread,</hi> whereby they might partake of one and the same Bread individually; which is therefore called the communion of the Body of Christ, and whereby they are <hi>made one Bread,</hi> as in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that the Scripture doth express that communion by that word <hi>Meeting,</hi> or <hi>being together</hi> in Ordinances, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>with one Mind or Spirit,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting that which is the Spirit and Life of publick Worship, which (above all other Actions done by a Multitude) is to have the nearest Union of Spirits, wherein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire communion of Saints lieth, and whereby God is glorified. And for several Churches to meet in the same manner, or at the same time, for the same kind of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, herein doth not lie so much communion, as an uniformity between them. But this is the most internal lively communion, to joyn in the same Act, at the same Instant, altogether to God; and is the greatest imitation of Heaven, where one Spirit will run through all, and God will be all in all at once.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And to make yet the communion nearer, (for it is to be the nearest) it must be of persons fixed and constant in such a communion; for that is still a more entire nearness, that the same Persons should still in an ordinary way, meet to joyn in their Spirits in the same Ordinances, and so inwardly and joyntly thus to glorifie God, as well as externally. The continuance and the fixedness of the same persons, makes still the union the intirer. And therefore if, for to enjoy the intirest communion of Saints on Earth, it was necessary to part the Saints for publick Worship; then also it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to part them into fixed Bodies, which still also is the nearest resemblance to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is the perfection of communion.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:154381:49"/> 5. To make this communion yet more intire, it is necessary that as they should fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly join in Ordinances of Worship, so in all other; and that the same persons should enjoy the same Ordinances, and one kind of Ordinances as well as another; that as they are Preached to by the same Elders, so they should join in the same Prayers, have the same breathings of the Spirit from those Prayers, partake of the same Bread, feed at the same Table; As in a Family, the intireness of it lies in this, that they have the same Father and Mother, the same Master and Mistress, partake of the same Bread every way, and of the same Family Duties and Family Comforts, and so now this communion, in a particular Church, both as to Worship and Government, is uniform. Yea and Acts of Government being Worship (which the Souls of Men are edified by, as well as they are by Sermons) are wholly Spiritual: It is not here as in <hi>Israel</hi> whose Government was more carnal; for it was the judging of civil causes (Civil and Ecclesiastical Government, being all one, mixed together, as the Church it self was) it was in such controversies and cases, as now men plead in Civil Bars about Estates; only God was pleased to give Laws himself for ordering of such things. But the Apostle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. severeth the judging of matters in the Church, as a Church by way of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from their judging of things about this Life. A Church as a Church medleth not now with them, for these affairs of it are wholly Spiritual.</p>
                  <p>So that for a conclusion, if all the Wits of World should have studied a way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive what kind of Church to Erect for the intirest communion of Saints, to attain to that end which is the end of a Church Instituted, they could have pitched upon no other but this; neither could there have been such a way found out of all other as this is. If that the Church Universal, the communion of it had been only occasional, the Saints meeting only by vertue of being Members of the Catholick Church promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously and indefinitely, sometimes in one company, sometimes in another, though by this promiscuous and indefinite way, there had been a more extensive communion of Saints indeed, (that is, each Saint might have come to have joined in publick Worship with more numbers of Saints, at several times, with more variety) yet it had not been so intensive, so near and high a communion, as for the same Saints under the same Officers fixedly to meet. And besides, they could not have had an Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication out of this communion, unless first knit into fixed bodies, neither could they have chosen Officers, unless such whose Office should cease with the Act, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, which indeed is not an Office; for that is a separation of a Man to a continued performance of a Duty. Nor would it have brought that blessing, that a constant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Men to an Office for perpetuity would do, which could not be done in that occasional fluid way.</p>
                  <p>If that such Congregations and Officers, though bounded within such a compass of a City or so, should have remained unfixed, tho' associated together within such a circuite or compass; yet this would not have made this intireness of Communion of Saints; as by this way of fixed Congregations there is. And also, in this case, the Institution of a Church would have been pitched upon some one part, or particular kind of Communion, and upon something less principal in it, and not upon the ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate and full foundation of it.</p>
                  <p>For First, In this unfixt way of People and Officers, though bounded in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, this number of Saints should have heard this Minister to day, and with other Saints have heard another to Morrow, none meeting one day together, that do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, in which also all might run to one Officer still where he Preached and leave the other, which would not breed an orderly communion, but rather a confusion. But to have the same Officers to be fixed, and the same persons to enjoy the dispensation of the same Officers, as in a Family, Children and Servants are under the same Governours, this is a nearer and intirer communion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In this classical way, there would indeed be a constant and a fixed commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Government, of the Elders (namely of such a circuit) who, when matter of Government was to be exercised, should all meet; but they would not permit (in such a way) or let in the Elders of the same Province, to meddle, as often as they would come, no not though occasionally they were present there, or came thither to that end. But now to have the same Elders and People fixed for all acts of Government, and yet to have them unfixed in respect of performing of Worship (when that is the main end both the of communion, and for which Elders are appointed) and not to have the same fixed companies of People that communicate in this company with those
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154381:49"/> Elders, as in this unfixed way they have not, this would put too great an inequality, between communion in Government and communion in Worship, and make the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality on the part of Worship rather, because Government is fixed of the same Persons, People and Elders, and yet Worship, wherein is the nearest communion, is left unfixed. And surely, if communion, and intireness of publick communion, be the end of a Church, the frame, and mould of the Church should rather be cast, and shap'd to that which is the intirest communion, than unto that which is more loose. Now in Worship (as to the Acts, and Duties of it perform'd) there is a capacity of an entirer communion, than in Government, because the Duties thereof are more constant.</p>
                  <p>If, Thirdly, The People be fixed for Worship in several Bodies, but the Elders Fluid in a circulatory Preaching, (as it is pleaded) and so they are made one Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the same Elders that teach, do also Govern them too and so they have a near com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Worship too, because they are at times taught by the same Elders: If this (I say) be made a ground of moulding these several Congregations into one Church, yet it is defective. For it makes the Peoples communion, in enjoying the same El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at times successively, to be the foundation of Church Institution (yea, and in this case of, the first Church <hi>proprie dicta,</hi> or properly so called) rather than the communion of Saints, and of the same persons of the Saints, meeting fixedly for Worship. But it is hard to conceive, how the oneness of a Church should be setled, rather on such a temporary communion in Elders, than on a constant commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Ordinances, whenas the same Elders are enjoy'd by these persons but at times; (which is an interrupted communion also) yea and there are no times neither, wherein as to Acts of Worship they enjoy the same Elders all together. Now that such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Elders, and communion in them, in such a broken way, should carry away the great priviledge of a thing (becoming the ground of the Institution of it) from constant communion, both of the same Saints and Elders, and be preferred thereto in this respect, seems strange. And if it be said, that yet the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this way meet, and have all communion in those Acts of Government, though not in Worship. Yet First; However it cannot be thought, that an occasional communion (as acts of Government comparatively are) should carry away the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the shaping and the institution of the first Church. Secondly; The Women (who though they have not the interest of Jurisdiction, yet of communion, and of deprivation, and of Virtual Assistance by their Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they have) are excluded; Unless such Churches be so framed that they also be present.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; If we take that other Presbyterial way that is practised, wherein they are fixed for communion in Worship, both Elders and People, but not for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yet, even here that fore-mentioned intireness of Government is parted, and the communion of Saints in that one respect divided. And being divided, the ground and foundation of all and either, being (as was said) the communion of Saints, is thereby weakened many ways. For 1. Still this communion is partial, and by that means each stands but upon one single <hi>Basis,</hi> whereas both joyn'd it might stand on two. For now in this case, the communion in Worship (the blessing of which should strengthen that of Censures, which is a casting out of the communion) is the ground of the meetings of each Congregation: But communion in Government in common, is the foundation of another Church over all Congregations. 2. A communion of Elders, rather than of the Saints, is the foundation of this supposed institution of a Church; and the communion of Saints therein is but representative, and at second hand, themselves being absent. It is a communion for them, but not a communion of them. Yea, they have no communion, not of presence in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and in the Execution, but are only Congregations of those Elders, that did make a Church concerned therein. But on the contrary, a communion of Saints, even in Government, is the ground and end of erecting of a Church, and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one Church in relation principally unto them.</p>
                  <p>Now then to wind up all; If there may be such a communion of Saints under the Gospel, so adequate and intire, and Churches so formed, as that the same Saints should join in the same Worship, with a joynt, constant, inward, individual communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein, and these Saints may have, and do enjoy (as our Brethren grant) fixt Elders, by whose Ministry and Dispensation, they partake with them in the same Worship
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:154381:50"/> which makes their communion, yet comparatively more intire, (for in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial way, there communion is principally by Elders, and therefore in this also, a due consideration is to be had, as adding a farther intireness) and these Elders being a Presbytery, yea and enough to make a Presbytery for all Acts of Government (as we shall after shew a company of Elders in Congregations to be) at all which Acts of Government, which are for the edification of the Saints, they can be present, and have a personal communion, as well as in those of Worship; if also the communion of Saints be the end of Erection of particular Churches, and is the measure fitted; for <hi>finis dat Mensuram Mediis, the end gives Measure to the Means,</hi> and if this end may be adequately and intirely attained this way, why should partial ends be preferred to total and compleat, all ends meeting in one? Yea if communion of Saints in Worship be the chief communion, yea and the communion of Saints be the principal funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cause of all Church Institution, Why should not it draw to it self communion in Government also, when there is a sufficiency for the performing the Acts thereof? Why should the communion of Elders be taken off from the communion of the Saints? Why should a Presbytery be erected, that is taken off from a Church and Assembly of Saints; When yet there is a sufficient Presbytery over a Church of Saints, that meet for all acts both of Worship and Government, and when yet these greater Presbyteries would challenge their power from this lesser Presbytery of Churches, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than from the name Church, and yet take it off from these Churches, they pretend to be a Presbytery unto? Yea, why should any affirm, that, although a particular Congregation had a sufficiency of Elders, yet it is God's Ordinance that they should associate, for whereas the avoiding of Division is pretended, it makes a worse division, dividing Worship from Government, and Elders from the particular Churches of Saints, and so parting from them, that wherein they ought to have the intirest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. So, as all things considered, the institution of a particular Church, falls most haply, uniformly, and adequately upon a Congregation intirely and alone, and upon no other manner of Assemblies at all.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the Forming of Saints into Churches, under the Government of Elders, is a matter of that needful order, as requires a Divine Institution for it. That it was also requisite, that the extent of those Churches, and the Limits of the Elders Jurisdiction should be set and determined by Christ.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUT this being granted, that Churches in the New Testament are formed and fixed Bodies, which are either the Seat of Worship, or of Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and likewise that there is a necessity it should be so, yet the next question will be, whether the setled Form and Order of these Bodies, the extent, bounds and compass thereof, into which the Church Universal should be parted and divided, and which should be the Seat of Government, be set out by Christ's special appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and institution, or hath been left by him to Men to frame and order, according to the common rules of edification, as matters of circumstantial order use to be. But we humbly conceive this to be a point of such order, and of so much weight and moment, and belonging to the substance of Government, as that, if there were any special institution and designment of other things, belonging to the order of Church Government, then also of this: As appears to us whilst we take estimate and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, with any other particular, acknowledged to be the subject of institution, as also established by more direct warrant. For the satisfaction of this Query, we shall give the general demonstration of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of it, That it is and must needs be so: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the form and extent of these Churches and Bodies, that are the Seat of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shall prove to be, which whether Congregational, Classical, Provincial, or Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, we yet dispute not. What at the present we endeavour to make forth is only this in the general, that whatsoever kind of form or extent they are moulded into, this form and extent must be set out and taken from some institution. The <hi>Quale,</hi> or what sort of Bodies, and what measure thereof Christ hath instituted, is to be afterward discussed.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:154381:50"/> And although the proof hereof will not be full and compleat until the demonstration of the <hi>Quale,</hi> or of what is the particular form or boundary and extent, both of Church and the Elders jurisdiction, and this be shewn to have been instituted; yet we shall for the present endeavour such a demonstration as shall be sufficient for a general foundation to that which follows, and enough to confirm the point as in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>Now for the more distinct proceeding in this, there is a double Seat of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conceived to be in these Bodies of Saints and Elders, whether according to our Brethren's Principles or our own. According to our Brethrens, all Government is put into a Body of Elders, and so they make the Elders the <hi>subjectum inhaesionis, the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent subject</hi> of all the Power; and the Church or the company of the Faithful to be <hi>subjectum occupationis,</hi> that is, <hi>the subject committed to them to be governed.</hi> Even as in a Corporation, where tho' the Power and Government is in the Magistrates alone, and so they are the subject of inherency, in whom the power resides; yet a limited extent of Jurisdiction, namely, a Corporation of People, in such a compass or precinct, is the <hi>subjectum occupationis,</hi> the seat, the circuit over whom, and among whom their Government is extended, and within confined. But if according to our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the Government is instituted by Christ to be mixt of an Aristocracy of Elders, and a Democracy of the People, yet still the like supposition necessarily ariseth, that there is, and must be, a limited seat or precinct, in which this Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is exercised, which we call the Seat of Government; And look, what Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in the Body of Elders, as Elders, it is within that seat or compass. That which therefore these following General Arguments and Demonstration did aim at, is, to prove that the extensive Limits, and Bounds of such Ecclesiastical Authority; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the proportion and measure of those Bodies, or Churches, the Seat thereof, and in which it is exercised, is a matter of that nature, weight, and moment, as to have a special Line of institution, by which it may be measured forth. And to that end the demonstration hereof shall be framed, and fitted to prove these two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the forming up of Elders into Bodies, or Presbyteries, and the Limits and Boundaries of the extent of their Power, is a matter of that nature, as must be set out by Institution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That answerably thereunto, the setting ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the compass, measure, limits and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of those Bodies of Saints and Elders making Churches (which are the seat or subject, in which a company of Elders shall have a Jurisdiction, and that company of Saints the priviledge of Government, and unto which the extent of their Jurisdiction is to be limited) must also be set out by a special Institution, and that their priviledge, to become such, depends upon a special Charter also.</p>
                  <p>We might speak to each, and either of these severally and apart, but that indeed these two, the setting the limits to the extensive power of Elders; and also the setting out the measure of those Bodies unto which their Government (whether joyned with the People, or alone, we yet argue not) shall extend and be confined, are both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurable each to other, and do mutually argue each other. For all Power and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in what Company or Body of Rulers soever, that are the subject in whom it resides, must have a seat, compass or precinct of men united in one, in which to exercise their power. And the true measure of their extensive power is from the measure of the extent of that seat, so as the proving of either of them to be necessarily done by Institution, is to prove both, for they mutually argue each other, and the extent of the one is resolved into the other. And therefore if the extent of any one be of Divine Institution, the other must be of Divine Appointment also, as we shall after shew.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore that these two are so conjunct in the nature of the thing, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the demonstrations each of other; we will in discoursing of them, put them together, sometimes giving demonstrations that joyntly concern both, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto both; sometimes such as concern either of them singly, in such a method as may best serve to clear the truth of this Assertion, which to us lays the foundation of deciding this great controversie, as in the sequel will appear.</p>
                  <p>We shall rank our Arguments under these four heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That these two forementioned, are substantial points of Order, and therefore are to be fetched from Institution.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:154381:51"/> 2. That they are matters of such Order, as other things are of, which we do find (and all do so acknowledge) to have been matter of Institution. </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Wisdom, and Prerogative of Christ (who is the Supream Institutor, and Law-giver to his Church) is as much concerned and interested; in the Institution of these, as in any other things he hath Instituted about Officers, and Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Spiritual Reason, suited to the Nature of the things themselves, fall in to confirm this.</p>
                  <p>The touch of the consequence of these three first, is justly founded upon what we have already said of Institution. As that the <hi>Colossians</hi> received their Order from <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> as the <hi>Lord,</hi> as well as their Faith. And besides; That the Substantials of Church Government should be set out by Institution, all sides have acknowledged, and the case therefore must needs be like, in all matters of like Order and Substantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for the Wisdom and Prerogative of the Law-giver is alike concerned, to appoint one as well as another; and else too, Church-Government consisting of things of like rank and nature, some of them should yet be Divine, some Humane, and so it would consist some part of Gold, and some of Wood. So as here we need but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply those generals to the confirmation hereof; but yet we shall further endeavour to confirm them all along, in the mention of, and together with those particular proofs, which we shall alledge for the Heads forementioned. And those reasons shall not only or simply be drawn, from parallelling these two points of Order with other things, which are substantial in all Government, and are acknowledged almost by all, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by our Brethren, to be matter of Divine Institution in, and about Church Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Government. We shall not thus only deal by consequence, in the closure of the proofs for the second Head, but also by Scripture, more directly holding forth the truth thereof, and all backt and seconded with an harmony of Spiritual Reasons, according to the nature of the thing falling in, and suiting to it.</p>
                  <p>Only let this be taken along and remembred, that the scope of these Reasons, in this place, is only to demonstrate this in the general, and in the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>that it is so,</hi> and and not now to prove the point, by laying out the very particular bounds and limits, set by the Holy Ghost. For that is to be tryed out afterwards, by our Brethren and Us, who of Us can shew the surest and most antient Land-marks hereof, which particulars when they shall come to be delineated, and set out, and confirmed by Scripture and Reason, the proof of this general truth will be found more full and compleat, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever either side can shew to be the true and notive characters of the Institution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But till then, we must necessarily here in this place, content our selves with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Arguments, and which are accordingly suited to this scope, and none other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I shall begin with the first Head; That both these are as substantial matters in Church-Government, as any of those other about the Institution of Officers Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can be supposed to be. To evidence which, what fairer estimate can be taken, whereby to judge of what is substantial in this Government, than from what is in all Mens apprehensions such, in any Government whatever? Now take any Society of Men that are embodied for Government, and if the Officers and Laws of it are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, the Common-wealth or Body it self, the Bounds and Limits of its Jurisdiction are defined also, and by the same hand, the one at first is constituted, the other is too, and this is true, especially of such bodies, as hold, from a supream power, the Charter for their Government, as all Churches do hold their Order from Christ the Supream Founder. In this case, it is every way as essential to have the Body of People it self formed up into an Unity, and the extent of their Jurisdiction, set by that Supream Power, as to have Officers over it, and Laws by which they are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned. The first is necessary in it self for the good of those bodies (in relation to orderly Government) and it is as necessary as the setting out the extent of every Man's Lands (which he possesseth, and of which the abutments and limits are as exactly mentioned in their deeds, as any thing else. And thus necessary is setting down the extent of Jurisdiction, of every Incorporate Town, and accordingly set forth in their Charter. Thus <hi>London</hi> is differenced from <hi>Westminster,</hi> which otherwise would be judged but one City, and one Incorporate Body; And this was necessary in their first edition, and to preserve distinction and intireness of Government without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and usurpation. 2. For the other particular, it is as necessary to confine those
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:154381:51"/> Officers and their Jurisdiction within the compass of certain seats and bodies politick, as to define and limit the acts of their power, and wherein to judge and intermeddle. In all civil Bodies, Kingdoms, Common-wealths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their Laws are as exact to set down the limits of Jurisdiction, the extent of power, as the degree, or kind, or sort of acts, of power to be put in execution by those entrusted with it; and all Officers in several Provinces or Bodies Incorporate, that give a Commission of Power, from the Supream Power, have in their Commissions and Charters, as express a mention and definition of the circuit and extent of power, as of their acts of Power, so as a greater nullity ariseth not from any other thing, as from extending power commited beyond the bounds of Jurisdiction; and it is a <hi>Premunire</hi> as well to do an act of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment out of their Jurisdiction, as an undue act within it, as to Arrest or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son out of their jurisdiction. And that Mayors or Bailiffs shall judge only within such a Town or Borrough, is as express in their Charter (or at least that the limit of their Jurisdiction being determined within the same, their Power without is null and void) as that they shall be Mayors and Bailiffs there. And thus this parallel confirms both parts of the Argument, both that it is alike substantial, and also that therefore it alike depends upon the determining of the Supream Lawgiver. And although this estimation be taken from Man's Law and Civil Government, yet it is in a matter, that is alike common to both. If indeed Church Government could be supposed to be a matter of that nature, that such boundings and determinings of the Seat and Extent of Elders Jurisdiction, in order to Government, were not existent in it, and necessary thereunto as well as to other Government also, but might be transacted promiscuously without any such boundings, then indeed the form of the parallel would not carry it to erect any thing in Church-Government, by a parallell from the Civil. But all that (do or will acknowledge any Ecclesiastical Government, as they do acknowledge fixed Bodies of Saints and Elders (which the former assertion cleared) so withal they must acknowledge such a determination necessarily to be made to bound those Seats of Government, and Extent of Elders Jurisdiction, either by God or Men. Now therefore in this we only argue, that the determination thereof, is of that nature, that it must be set out by the Supream Lawgiver, as well as other things are, that concern this Government. Thus much however is preparatory to what follows, that this Assertion is most rational and coincident with the like principles of reason humane, though of, and about a matter Spiritual. Yet because it will be said it is but an Argument from Men (which yet in the case of Ministers maintenance, as in other things also, the Apostle useth to produce and confirm thereby the rationality of a Divine Ordinance, about this matter, when yet there were other grounds also for it in the Scripture that it is such) therefore we will proceed to the other general head, that the forming Saints into Churches, and setting the bounds thereof, are matters of such order as God and Christ hath Instituted, we shall endeavour to make forth (proceeding by degrees) both by parallelling these with other matters of Order, about Officers and Church-Government which God hath Instituted, and by demonstrating that these are as great points of Order, as those other which Christ as a Lord hath given: And we shall also evidence it, by the addition of such Scripture-proofs and instances, as do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly hold forth the truth thereof, and so confirm too, that other parallel reason about them.</p>
                  <p>Now to prove the parallel between this, and other matters of Order, let this be premised and taken along, that this second sort of reasons, drawn from comparing these, or either of them, with other things that are instituted, and thence proving the Institution of these also (though we insist not only or wholly on them) is in this case just and sure. For we stretch not the argument from parallel or like reason to find out any new thing in Church-Government, whose existency is argued and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meerly upon parallel reason. That way of reasoning we leave to our Brethren, in rearing up their whole Fabrick upon the parallel reason of a particular Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. to the prejudice of that foundation which these are built on. But the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of Elders Jurisdiction, and the seat of their ordinary Government, being a thing that necessarily existeth, and which must be acknowledged to have place already, or else no orderly Government can at all be supposed to be (as both sides do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) If then the question shall be (which is the thing now before us) whether the setting out those limits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be a matter of that nature, as should be set out by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christ, as other matters of parallel nature are? Or whether Christ hath
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:154381:52"/> left them as things of that inferiour alloy and nature, and of so small moment, as to be determined by the common rules for edification, as other circumstantial matters are? In deciding this Case and Question, and for the general demonstration of it, certainly parallel reason will carry it, that these things are to be set out by God, and not left to Men, especially when there shall be added unto these, Scriptures that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly speak the same thing, that parallel reason doth. This being premised, we shall speak to each singly.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. We begin first with that of the bounding the extent of the power and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Elders; that this is to be found set out by Institution will appear, for the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of it in the general, both ways, either, 1. By comparing it with other matters of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or, 2. By what the Scriptures do more directly hold forth, about setting the limits of the extensive power of Officers; Or, 3. By Reason falling in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is evident by comparing this point of order with other things which our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren themselves, according to their principles, do hold to, and acknowledge to be matters of Instituted order, in many of which we also concur with them. Let but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial comparison and estimate be taken and made with other things, concerning Church Elders and their Power, which they cleave to, as instituted, even to a nullity for the want of it in other persons and things. They do shew themselves sufficiently tender and jealous of having Institutions, for the exercise of any part of Ecclesiastical Power, and will allow none but persons authorised by an Institution, and in such and such a way, to the exclusion of others for want of Institution. For example, 1. Why else do they exclude the Body of the People from having an interest of suffrage in Excommunication, or casting out of the Church, or ordaining Elders, and confine these Acts, and all other supposed Acts of Government, unto Elders only? 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though to Excommunicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be an Act of Government, that belongs to the Office of Eldership, yet they would allow no one Elder to Excommunicate alone, no not in that Church whereof he is Pastor in a special fixt relation, but it must be Elders united into an Aristrocracy, because it is by Institution so implied, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> &amp;c. which is always more than one. Yea, they Assert that such an Act of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, Peaceable Plea. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</note> is Null and Void if but by one Elder alone. Yea, 3. If any one Pastor though never so eminent, should be set up in a lawful Presbytery to be of the <hi>Quorum</hi> in that Presbytery, wherein he is a Member and an Elder, so as nothing should be done but with, and by his consent, and suffrage, though not without the rest of the Presbytery also, (which was all that Power, that Bishops antiently challenged and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised) yet this would be, and is denied to any, as a thing beyond that degree of Power given any one Man among the rest. And 4. Those that are acknowledged Elders, namely Ruling Elders, they would strictly debar from Preaching, from Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Publick, or Blessing the People, or Administring the Sacrament, because these are Acts of the Preaching Elder's Office by Institution, or else why are they excluded if Christ would not have them so? Yea, 5. Though the substance of the Act of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination (which they call <hi>Missio Potestativa)</hi> be an Act of the whole Presbytery, Ruling Elders and others; yet the Right of laying on of hands, which is the lesser, they allow not to Ruling Elders, but appropriate it to Preaching Presbyters in the Presbytery. And 6. Although there may be many Elders in a particular Church, that make up therein an Eldership, who when alone, without Neighbour Churches, did exercise all, and had compleat Power of Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (as they grant) yet when Churches came to be Multiplied, or there are Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches whom they may associate with, many of our Brethren hold, that in this case they have no longer Warrant or Power (at least not as to the exercise of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment within themselves) but are to joyn in common with those other Elders of Churches for all Acts of Government. And all this must be because Christ hath, by Institution, so fixt the Power of Governing (in respect of the Acts thereof) as they are not, by any other or any otherwise, to be put in execution. Yea, 7. If that the Churches go and chuse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cull out a certain company of their Officers, and all the Churches in a Kingdom should chuse them that should be set apart for Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction only, and attend them in a set and constant way, (as the <hi>Synedrim</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> was chosen) our Brethren would say, that although here were Elders chosen out of all the Churches unto such Acts (as are the Acts of Elders, according to their principles, lawfully thus chosen) and that they make up (according to them) one Body
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:154381:52"/> or Corporation representatively of all the rest, as the National Assemblies use to do; yet if these should be thus constantly set apart unto such a work, they would deny this to be lawful; and the unlawfulness must lie in this, that they are not formed up, according to the Institution. So that a little variation, in this kind, must still have a new Institution for it, according unto them. And shall there not be the like for the bounding the exercise of Elders extensive Power, which is of as much, if not far more moment, than many of these things can be supposed to be of? And then lastly; Add to all these an <hi>8th</hi> Principle, which singly and alone concludes the general point in hand, but, joyned with those other, brings the forces of them all more strongly up to the conclusion. In the Controversie with the Bishops, there is a distinction of a double Ecclesiastical Power; The one <hi>Potestas Intensiva;</hi> The other <hi>Extensiva.</hi> The one imports a further degree or kind of Power; The other a further extension of power. And in both these respects, they distinguished a Bishop from an ordinary Presbyter. In respect of Power <hi>Intensive;</hi> A Bishop might do some Acts a Presbyter might not do; even as a Presbyter might do Acts a Deacon might not do, which constituted these three several Orders in the Church. A Bishop might Ordain and Excommunicate, not so a Presbyter. And as they made them to differ thus in acts of Order, and Intension of Power, so in respect of Jurisdiction, and in that respect chiefly, that is, that an ordinary Presbyter was set over some particular Flock and Congregation; But a Bishop was for Acts of ordinary Government, set over a whole Diocess, and over many Congregations, to rule them in common, as making one Church. And so an Archbishop, though he was of the same Order with a Bishop; (for they made those two, not to constitute two several Orders) yet, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a larger extent in Territory or Jurisdiction, they were said to differ, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of extention of Power. Now our Brethren, and all those, who writ against this further Power of Extension and Jurisdiction in Bishops, called for an Institution for such a further degree and extent of Power, as well as for a new Order of Power, and that not only as to the large pretended power in a Bishop beyond a Presbyter's, but also of an Archbishop over a Bishop. So do we also require an Institution for that power which our Brethren claim. An usurpation lies not only in an undue form of Government, that Christ hath not instituted; (as to set up one man to rule, when it is in the hands of many, which is to erect a Monarchy when Christ hath ordained an Aristocracy, which is the ground of exception against Episcopal Power) Nor doth it only lie in usurping undue Acts of Power, which Christ never Instituted; But further it lies in a company of Elders taking on them an extent of Power for Territory and Jurisdiction, larger than that extent, which an evidence of Institution can be produced to Warrant. In this case although a company of Elders do in their proceedings take on them to execute none other, but such as are due Acts of Government, for the kind of them, and those regulated according to such Rules as the Word warrants (as in respect to the Sins proceeded against) nor none other acts, but which belong to the Office of Elders. Yea and tho' all this be done by them, as cast and combined into a joint body, (no one Man amongst them assuming more power than the rest) and so this Government be carried in an Aristocratical way; (which is the Right form that Christ, according to them, hath Instituted) yet if they stretch the extent of their power unto a larger line or circuit, than Christ hath made the Territory or Seat of Church Government, this must needs prove an usurpation, let the pretence be never so specious, and the proceedings otherwise never so just. For extensive power must be warranted by Institution, as well as intensive, or the measure or kind of power: Whereas yet we perceive many, that are zealous for Institutions in those other things, would (so far as we can understand) have the boundaries of the extent of power Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical, to be left (with other things of less moment) to be ordered only according to the common rules of edification, and of the Law of Nature, as humane Prudence shall think fit to dispose and set them out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unto which add, Secondly, That God hath, both under the Old Testament, as also the New, made the bounding and setting the extent of Church Officers extensive power the subject of his own institution and designment, which confirms the truth of this point in the general.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. First, in the Old Testament (which we have not now recourse to, as our Brethren use to have as an Instance, that the same particular extent of Government that was then, should be the Model of Christ's Institution under the New; we shall confute that large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:154381:53"/> afterwards.) This was the matter of Christ's Institution. As therefore under the Old, the several sorts of Officers were appointed, and also their limits of Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so now under the New, as Christ hath Instituted the kind of Officers and Elders, so he should set out the extent of their Jurisdiction: Especially since we suppose such Officers having such a Power (as our Brethren and we suppose) by Institution, it is therefore necessary, that it should be determined either by God or Man, what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their Jurisdiction should be. We do not herein urge the Analogous like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, of the Old Testament and the New, to raise up the like particular Rule and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, for the extent of Elders Power, now as then; but only as a proof of this general Maxime, that when we find the like subject of Institution in the New, the reason will hold, that as there was an Institution set for the bounds of the Intensive Power of Officers among them (as of the Order of Priests above <hi>Levites,</hi> &amp;c.) and their several work accordingly designed, so the bounds of Jurisdiction and of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Power, in the Government of that State and Church, were set out by the same hand also; so in like manner, Christ hath ordered things in the New Gospel Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration. They under the Old Testament had those that were their Elders of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Towns, whose Power was bounded within their several Cities and Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and this set out by a Law. They were, in the case of Murther, to measure the Ground, and the Elders of that City unto which the Field a Man was kill'd in, was nearest, were to intermeddle in it. And they had their General Elders for the Nation or People, distinguished from the other, so that the extent of their Jurisdiction was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, proportioned to the extent of the Nation, who are therefore called <hi>the Elders of the People,</hi> in general, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 66. and which were that <hi>Synedrim,</hi> and state of Elders at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for the Nation, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 5. and so distinguished from those they called El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a City, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. 3. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 23. 8. And as in these Scriptures singly, so <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 4. we have both mentioned with their Titles of distinction, <hi>Let the Elders of all the Congregations stand, and with them the Elders of every City, and the Judges thereof.</hi> The one had the whole Body of the Nation for their Jurisdiction; The other had only their several Cities. Thus also the bounds of Extensive Power, as well as Intensive, was set out by the Word of the Lord in the hand of <hi>Moses.</hi> The several charge of four sort of <hi>Levites,</hi> in the things of the Sanctuary, was divided amongst them, to have care of, and the limits of extensive power of Jurisdiction were fixed in the hands of four Men, over each of those Companies and Bodies of those <hi>Levites,</hi> as you have it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 3. which were called Overseers over the rest, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 14, 22. The like might be shewn in the Order of Priesthood; There was the intensive power, which was equal among them all; And above the <hi>Levites</hi> (for order of Office) there was by Institution, in the High-Priest (as <hi>Aaron)</hi> a further or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense power of Office, for some services above the rest: Which degree of intense power, was by the special call of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. And as of a power of intention, so of extention or jurisdiction, there was a setled appointment. There were set over several companies of Priests, Chief Priests that were in those several circuits Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 4. and 27. 1. <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 4. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 14. who were twenty four in number.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the New Testament, we find the several extent of Officers Power and Jurisdiction to have been matter of Institution. Our scope is not here to set out what the particular Limits are, for that belongeth to an after discussion. But all that we shall now produce, is but to confirm the point in the general.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We find differing extent of Officers Jurisdiction to have been, not only matter of Institution, but also to have, among other things, put a difference upon Officers, such as in imitation hereof, the Pope and the <hi>Bishops</hi> challenged in difference from ordinary Presbyters. This was one thing made an Apostle differ from an Evangelist, and an Evangelist from ordinary Pastors and Teachers; that an Apostle had the care of all Churches committed to him, whereas an ordinary Elder was designed to an actual care of a Church, as a Governour in a Family is of his House, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. In the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. the Apostle strongly intimates the difference by a comparison, of his Power as an Apostle, and their's as <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that this Power differed in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; <hi>Do not ye</hi> (says he) <hi>judge them that are within?</hi> Namely, your selves, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your own body; <hi>What have I to do to judge them that are without?</hi> His main scope is to shew, that in their proportion they had power to judge all within their jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as he had in his; and that as his jurisdiction was in the extent of it, limited <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:154381:53"/> all within, that is, all Churches of Christ, in opposition to Heathen, and he had no power, he had nothing to do to judge them without, so theirs was also extended to all within themselves but no further. I that am an Apostle (says he) have a limited Jurisdiction in my kind, and you in yours, and as I am to do my duty in my Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, so you in yours. And if the Apostle would not stretch himself beyond his line (as his own phrase is) of jurisdiction set out to him, then ordinary Elders much less are to go beyond their's.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The New Testament is express for it. The Holy Ghost hath appointed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Elders jurisdiction over their own Flocks, and to extend to every Soul therein in particular, even over the whole Flock whereof they are Elders, and that as a whole Flock: Importing an intire body of persons committed to them. Therefore the extent of a like kind of power, any further, or over any other, ought much more to have a special Institution, which so far as it wanteth, and cannot produce and shew the bounds for, from Institution, so far it is a nullity. Now we have an express Scripture concerning the Elders of the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> (whether it be Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or Presbyterial, or Diocesan, we do not now dispute, but shall afterwards try it out upon which the Institution falls) that they all and every of them had an extent of power by express commission given them, to that whole Flock; and that the Holy Ghost set them over that whole Flock, as in charge commended to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Take heed to your selves, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers.</hi> Men had not chalkt out the limits of this Flock, nor set them out this their bounds of power and care over it, but the Holy Ghost made them Overseers, that is, constituted them, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 2. it is said of <hi>Moses.</hi> And when 'tis said the Holy Ghost made them, it is not meant in respect of the personal call of those Elders, for ordinary Elders were not chosen by an immediate revelation of the Holy Ghost, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> was, <hi>The Holy Ghost said, separate me Paul and Barnabas, Acts</hi> 13. 2. But so these Elders were not made here: The constitution, or making, or appointing, and instituting them, must therefore necessarily be meant of the Holy Ghost's appointing that office of Elders, in which they were, and that he specially was the Author by his Institution of that kind of designment of Elders, to an whole Flock as Elders, as their special charge, within which, to take care as Elders of all; and by vertue of which (they undertaking the charge) the Institution and Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghost fell upon them. As when a King hath granted a Charter to such or such Towns, to have such and such Rulers over each of those whole Towns, though the King put not in the Officers; yet because the Towns chuse them, as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised by his special Charter, ordering their choice, and designing their jurisdiction, it may in charge be given to them, that the King hath set them over this whole Town to govern it. And what is attributed to the Holy Ghost thus, respects not a prudential management only, but the Holy Ghost's Office being in a special manner to be the Author of that Word and those directions of Christ, by which the Apostles did give forth the pattern of ordering and framing Churches to these <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and other Churches; therefore it is peculiarly appropriated to him to be the Author of all such constitutions Ecclesiastical, and this by so peculiar a prerogative, as is as proper to him, as to Redeem is to the Son. And therefore Man may no more assume to set up a new kind of Officers, or appoint them the bounds of their jurisdiction in the Church, than he can Redeem us. And therefore as to the Work of the Holy Ghost to the Church herein, mention is made of it, parallel with Christ's Redemption, in those Words, <hi>Take heed to all the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased by his own blood.</hi> And one special thing, which is attributed to the Holy Ghost (as an Instituter and ordainer of matters in the Church, and for which we cite this place) is, as to constitute the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Elders, and the form of Government, that all should take care in common, (for Elders, not Elder, are mentioned) so to fix also, the extent of their care, charge, and commission, to all that Flock, the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> whereof they are said to be Elders, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. It is his Institution that Elders should take care according to the extent of their relation, to a particular Flock, as their whole Flock committed to them: And by vertue of this his ordination, had they the full power of Elders unto this Flock. So as that such an office of Elders, (not one Elder only) that such a flock, as an whole flock, should stand in relation to these Elders in common, as the seat of their care and jurisdiction; all this was the ordination of the Holy Ghost. And if
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:154381:54"/> so, then the extent of jurisdiction over such a flock is instituted, as well as the Office. Therefore if these all or any company of more Elders, will challenge a new and further extent of jurisdiction, than to such a flock as <hi>Ephesus</hi> was, they must shew the like commission for that extent from the Holy Ghost; for it was by a special commission from the Holy Ghost, they had power of jurisdiction to this Flock. And by the same reason that their commission over this flock was by the Holy Ghost, by the same reason they must shew the like new commission, for a larger from the same Holy Ghost. We will only add this, that in cases of this nature a negative argument holds; For when extent of Power depends upon a superiour appointment and design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no further power, than that affirmatively declares and extends the commission, can be extended but with a nullity, yea, and with the greatest danger; and so unless the Holy Ghost declares affirmatively the extent of Elders power as Elders, in a Body united (as here he doth) over a larger company of Churches, as the seat of their jurisdiction, all the Elders in the World met together cannot, nor may not challenge it. A defect of commission affirmative is exclusive in this case. Yea farther in that he mentions this Flock, as that whole Flock they had commission over, he thereby speaks exclusively of any other, that as Elders in a Body they were to exercise authority in. As in the like case, if a King gave a Charter to a Mayor and Company of Aldermen, to rule such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Body of Men in a Corporation as an whole Body, they were set over, and it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly imported, not only that the extent of there power therein, being by his Charter therefore they must not exercise it as such a company out of the confines thereof, without the like Charter renewed; but also on the contrary, he who is the founder of their Power, and of whom they hold it, in his Charter, makes that company com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, to be all, or the whole flock committed to their charge. This evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently argues, that his Charter sets bounds to them, restraining them from taking on them to exercise their Juridical Power elsewhere. So far is it from what the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Principles hold forth, that in an analogous way, they may make new extentions of Jurisdictions, and in the same form model them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Add to this that the Holy Ghost hath been pleased to set limits and bounds of Power to several ordinary Officers in the same Church, wherein they are, in respect of a continual charge and service, ordinary standing Officers, and where all of them are in a joynt and common commission for the Government thereof. And look what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction there is in their Offices, and what is proper to each Office by his appointment, his command is answerably, that the one should not, by assuming to exercise the part of another, intrench upon the Office of another; so, that he who is a Ruling Elder, should not take on him to Teach as an ordinary Pastor, no not in the Church where he bears the office of an Elder, <hi>But let him that Teacheth, attend on Teaching, he that Exhorteth, on Exhortation, he that Ruleth, on Ruling,</hi> Rom. 12. 6. Now if Christ hath so set these bounds in the same Church and Body, as for any to usurp the others office, is that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>taking on him above his proportion,</hi> (which he condemns, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and prefaceth that general Rule, with special aim to keep each in their due bounds and station) then much more, or at least as much, hath his care extended to set down the bounds of Extensive Power, which they might know, that as in the same Church the Officers might not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, so the Elders of other Churches ought not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, intermeddle as Bishops in another's Jurisdiction, (to use the Apostle's Allusion) nor stretch themselves beyond their Line, as the Apostle would not. Thus I have proved, that the extent of Elders Jurisdiction is to be fetcht from an Institution▪</p>
                  <p>What is next to be demonstrated is, That the constituting and setting out the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and extent of <hi>that Church,</hi> which is to be the Seat of Government, is also mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Divine Order, and so to be fetcht from an Institution.</p>
                  <p>The Popish and Episcopal Divines, have appropriated that word, <hi>Order,</hi> unto the constituting a Church Officer, and unto his Ministry, whether Bishop or Presbyter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This, in their phrase, they called being in Orders, which in the thing carried this with it, <hi>viz.</hi> Their being of such Orders or Kinds of Offices, as Christ had by his Order appointed. But surely they narrowed the signification of it too much, for it may be extended to all Institutions whatever, and among other, to this of Church-state, and the constitution thereof, according to an Order set by Christ.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. In that order of the Church of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> in which the Apostle rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the right constitution and formation of their Church-state must needs be a main
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:154381:54"/> part intended <hi>Order</hi> (says Bishop <hi>Davenant) denotes their coadunation into one Body, namely, such as in an Army useth to be, and so respects the whole Body it self, as united and consenting together, and so made the seat of Order.</hi> Now as the dispose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and appointment of the Bulk and Body of the Army it self, and the form, the extent, the Wings thereof, is a matter of as much order, and as essential, as to appoint what Officers shall be over it, or what discipline in it: So 'tis here, and the order of this body of the Church it self, must be by some hand, either Humane or Divine, and sure, it was a Divine Order the Apostle here rejoiced in, as we have before shewed. And this will appear,</p>
                  <p>For 1. If we consider the moment of this their Church constitution and formation, we shall find it was meet and necessary, that the Lord Jesus himself should appoint it; For this is the form, which the efficient always gives, as well as the matter. As in natural Bodies, the Form constitutes them, as well as matter, so in all bodies that are the Seat of Government, their orderly frame and form, wherein they are united according to a Law or Fundamental custom, constitutes them such (that is, as they are Politick Bodies) as much as being Men of such a function or qualification and rank. Yea (as was said before) since a judicial Power of Government, depends as much upon a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of Order, as it doth upon a material qualification of persons, hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is as necessary (as was shewed by many instances) that Jesus Christ should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign out, and constitute, and authorize the form and order, and the bounds of his Church, as that he should determine the qualification of the persons or functions to whom the power is committed. For acts of Government, being to have his Blessing in a peculiar manner, to accompany them with a Spiritual efficacy, as well as Acts of Worship, it is as necessary for him to appoint the Form or Orders of that Body, in which he would accompany them with that efficacy, as it is to assign out the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial subject of Persons and Functions that are to execute it; And this our Brethren assent to, making it as necessary for Christ to Institute the form of Government, namely, an Aristocracy of Elders, as to appoint the Function or the Persons, namely, Elders themselves. For it may fall out, and often doth, that for the matter hereof, the Members of a Church, are not such, in respect of their lives and qualifications per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal, as should be in the Members of a Church, and yet because they take on them to be a Church, professing the Name of Christ, and Publick Worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hence Ministerially they are a true Church, as truly as an Ungodly Profane Minister is a true Minister, not in respect of his personal qualifications, but as his office is an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance which he bears, and whence it is that all his Administrations, while in that office, are not null nor to be reiterated. The like is to be said of the Church it self, whereof he is a Minister, it subserves Ministerially as a Church to God, rightly to have Baptism and other Ordinances of Christian Communion Administred in it, so as those Ordinances are not null, though Administred among such as are generally corrupt and not fit matter to be a Church. That therefore these Ordinances come to be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lawfully Administred, in this Church as a Church, must be by vertue of Christ's Institution and Charter, that hath made such and such a company of Men, so and so meeting for such ends and purposes, to be a Ministerial Church to him, and to be that great Ordinance, which is the Seat of all other Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is no less than the Seat, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the grand Repository as of Truth (as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.) so of Government and Worship, and so it is the next receptive of all the Promises that are made to accompany the Ordinances Administred therein. We say it is the Seat as of Truth, so of Government and Worship; For by comparing the <hi>5th</hi> and <hi>14th verses</hi> with that <hi>15th,</hi> we shall find that the Church of God is the same with that House of God, mentioned <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and likewise <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>If a Man know not how to Rule his own House well, how shall he take care of the Church of God? A Church,</hi> that is <hi>the subject of Government,</hi> as compared to an House, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Governour of a Family Ruleth. And it cannot be intended of the Church Universal, though universally, or rather indefinitely expressed (namely, for any or for all the particular Churches that are by God's appointment, the Subjects of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of an Elders Care and Rule, as a Family, (to which it is here set in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison) is of an Ocumenick or Houshold Government) for the Church there spo-of, is such a Church as ordinary Ministers take an actual special care of, like as he that is a Master of a Family doth of his own House more than all other. And this kind of Church to which the proper Care and Rule of Elders is limited, as it is the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154381:55"/> subject of Government, so it is the Seat of Truth, where by God's Ordinance it is held forth with a promise to preserve it among them, and to provide, that it shall be sown in the Hearts of the People of God, in that great Ordinance of Preaching by Pastors, which are God's own Institution, and accordingly Gifts are preserved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. As, if the Officers, the Laws and Statutes by which a Colledge or Town is governed, be by Charter, the Incorporation it self is such much more: So now if the Church be the Seat of Officers, then truly if God Instituteth the Officers themselves to feed the Flock, the Flock, over whom they are set, is appointed and ordained much more, and to it, as to an Ordinance of his setting up, the promise of preserving Truth is made. And if it be the Seat of all Ordinances (As the Apostle says, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17. <hi>I ordain in all the Churches)</hi> then the Churches themselves which are in this respect the Ordinance of these Ordinances, where he reposeth and betrusts them, and in which he blesseth them, is much more Christ's Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Yea, 3. Whereas if either of these two, the bounds of Elders Jurisdiction, or the Churches over which they are Elders, are to be fetcht from Divine Right, it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily argues both, yet of the two, the Institution of the bounds doth mainly and principally fall upon Church, primarily upon Church, and but secondarily upon the extent of Presbyteries. That of Church is the more fundamental measure of the division of Jurisdiction, and that of Presbyteries proportioned thereunto. Thus when it is said, <hi>The Apostles ordained Elders,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>in every Church,</hi> or <hi>Church by Church,</hi> 'tis not said that Churches were made <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> according to the mould or cast of Presbyters, but Elders were assign'd according to the mould, measure or latitude of Churches, and so the several bounds of Church power is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by the distinction of Church. Thus the style of the Scripture runs, and Churches were setled and not Presbyteries; And the distinction was not then taken from the names of Classes and Presbyteries, Provincial and National Assemblies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. (where <hi>John</hi> takes the measuring Reed in his Hand) what is the subject that Reed is applied to, and whereof the Measure is taken? It is <hi>the Temple, the Church,</hi> and not Presbyteries or Elderships; Therefore also <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. the style runs thus, <hi>Go tell the Church,</hi> which if it should be granted to be meant of the Elders, in our Brethrens sense, yet of Elders in relation to a Church, and in that respect so styled, as they are relatively the representation of some Church, within which their Jurisdiction is bounded. So that if there be any Institution that limits the bounds of their Power, it must necessarily fall upon the bound of Church first. Again, our Brethrens reasonings doth confirm this, for the chief weight of their Arguments for the extent of the Power of Elders over many Churches, in those instances of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem Ephesus,</hi> &amp;c. is taken from hence, that many Congregations are called one Church, and so, from the extent of Elderships and Elders, Power is derived, and measured thereby: And the chief Power, that is exercised, is to cast out of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> to judge them within their circuit.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; If either of these, the Jurisdiction of Elders, or the measure of Churches are to be fetcht from Institution, or set thereby, then both are to be so. The reason of this consequence is clear from this (which was but intimated afore) that all power in Governours or any other company of Men what ever, must have a Territory, a Precinct, a seat in which, and among whom to exercise their power, and accordingly the extent or limits of that seat, is the true measure of the extent of these Governours Power and Jurisdiction, the one being resolved into the other. If the one be Divine, the other is also; yea so as although the Holy Ghost should not have expresly and directly set down both, yet having done either, it is sufficient, for the one follows upon the other, and so conquently (as was said) if either be of Divine Institution, they both are so. Now the reason of this consequence is clear, not only from common reason in its parallel of all Jurisdictions else (wherein the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Officers extent of Power, is resolved into the measure of the Bodies of Men knit together in one, to such or such an extent, whether taken from place, or whatever else is made the boundary.) But further it may be particularly demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that this Ecclesiastical Government is according to the order of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For suppose the power of Government, whether in whole or in part, be in a company of Elders, yet it is not given them simply as Elders to their Persons, no nor simply as a Presbytery abstractedly considered (that is, as a company of Elders meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as such, continuing as they please over these and these Churches, or as few as they
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:154381:55"/> will) but what ever Jurisdiction is in them, is given in relation to a Seat; so as the division and partition of Elderships and Presbyteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their extent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, ariseth from the partition and division of Churches, and the extent thereof. And although what these due Limits of either are, is to be afterwards considered; yet these General do argue, that such are to be found set out by the Holy Ghost.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That it is the Prerogative of Christ's Power and Wisdom, to determine the due limits of Churches, and the boundaries of the Elder's power.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Prerogative of Christ, the Institutour, is as much seen in assigning a due extent of power to Elders; and in measuring out the just bounds, wherein their Authority is to be exercised, as in any thing which he hath instituted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Christ useth his great Prerogative in setting out, and in constituting and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church, that shall be the Seat of Government, which is his House.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In all Civil Government (and if there be a Covernment Spiritual derived from Christ, this Parallel will hold) the Stamp of Royal and Supream Authority (which is the Fountain of Government) is seen and exercised in nothing, more than in the grant of priviledges unto a company of Men, dwelling together to incorporate for Government, as also in setting the Bounds and Limits of such a Jurisdiction; and this is fundamental to all the rest; And answerably speaks the Scriptures. Thus in <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5. the Prerogative of Christ, above <hi>Moses,</hi> is argued from this, as the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Branch of it, that Christ was he that Built the very House it self; and therefore an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably, this is for the Honour of Christ. If a King had an infinite number of Subjects scattered over all the World, which could not be governed in the whole or lump, but by parts, distinguished and formed up into several Bodies knit together, were it not his Prerogative as much, yea, more, to appoint out the several Provinces or Territories, and the bounds thereof, which he would have Governed exactly, as to appoint the kind of Officers, or Acts of Government? Surely 'tis more. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Founders and Disposers of the Bounds of Commonwealths at first, have been esteemed Great, and more Renowned, than those that gave Laws, or Established the several kinds of Officers. It cannot be denied, but that there must be a Commission from Christ, to empower a company of Saints (that live in a Neighbourhood to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as Saints) to become a Church to Christ, not in a Mystical Relation only (for that they are as Saints, though they become not a Seat of publick Worship, and of an orderly Government here on Earth) but further to become a Subject of publick Worship; and also to injoy a Government among them. As the things themselves thus injoyed are such, as nothing more concerns God's Glory in this World; and the good and benefit of the Saints, so their becoming a Church (which is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this; and unto which, as such the priviledge of these is vouchsafed) is as great a favour and priviledge, as could be bestowed on them; which therefore must needs hold as much upon a free Gift and Charter of Christ, the Head and Lord of his Church, as any other thing can be supposed to do. A Gift and Favour it is, over and above their being Saints and Members of the Church Mystical, Electively bestowed, for such they might have been, and yet never have been ordered so to meet. As to be a Minister to the Church, it is a favour beyond a Man's being a Saint, or having Gifts, and none is to take that Honour to himself; but he that is called of God, and hath a Charter from him, for the kind of Ministry designed, (and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> makes that great Character of himself, from God's putting him into the Ministry) so for a company of Saints to take on them, the Title and Honour of a Church, and an whole Church (as every particular Seat of Worship and Government doth) which is the Title of the whole Universal Body of Christ, yea, to take on them the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Body, an whole Body to Christ; this must be by a special Charter and Warrant, what ever company of Men there be that do it. None can give that Title of Church, unless Christ hath given it, as none can take the Title of being a City in a Kingdom, or of being a priviledged place, but by Charter. If none can take on
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:154381:56"/> him the Dignity of an Earl, or of a Viscount, or of any Officer of State, so no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of People can of themselves, presume to be a City, but by special Charter; much less to be a Seat of Government, whereby they become not simply a company, but a Body politick. <hi>Church,</hi> in this Sense, is an Authoritative Word, and such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ariseth not from place, or any External Circumstance, no nor from meeting; but from a Charter that adds Authority, and above such considerations, unto such a company.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it should belong to the Prerogative of Christ, to determine the bounds of Elder's Jurisdiction, as much as to appoint the Elders or kinds of Officers themselves, evidently appears by it's Parallel. When any Officers derive their Governing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, from a Supream State; it concerns the Honour and Prerogative of that State, to define the extent of the Division of their Jurisdiction, as much as the kind of Officers. If therefore it be universally found, to be the Wisdom of all Supream Powers, with one consent to judge and account this bounding as justly to concern their Prerogative; shall we think that Christ hath been less jealous and careful of his Honour herein? Surely either there is no Government at all defined by him, and no sort or kind of Officers set and distinguished by him (but all is alike, left to Humane Prudence, as in Civil Government, all these things alike are) or it must be acknowledged, that the one concerns the Honour and Prerogative of Christ to Determine, as well as the other.</p>
                  <p>I know it may be said, that though it is necessary; yet it must be safely left to the Law of Nature, and to the Rulers of Prudence, for Men to appoint it; and that yet however the partition or measure of Churche's and Officer's extent is Divine, because God hath appointed that to be the measure; which Men in their Prudence shall think good to appoint. But this is indeed, to make both the extent of Officer's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the measure of the Churches, and the Seat thereof to be both Humane, even as the extent of the Power and Office of Civil Magistrates is; and is called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. And Magistracy is called an Ordinance of Man; because the extent of it is left to Men to appoint, as they shall think meet. And yet, if God had either set the bounds and extent of Officers Jurisdiction, or of Commonwealths, (which are both considerable) then had both been of Divine Institution; but since neither of them are so set, they are Humane, although in the General, God hath commanded that Magistrates shall have that measure of power, which Men and Commonwealths shall give them.</p>
                  <p>I will add one thing more, to strengthen Christ's Prerogative in this case, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Reason suited to the Nature of the thing it self, falls in to prove both the bounding the Elder's power; and the bounds of Churches, as the Seat of Government.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I argue from the Rise of the call of Elders. For though it were true, as some say, that all Saints as Saints, or as they are Mystical Members of the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, have a full and immediate right, (without any further Relation of Order and Union to a particular Church) <hi>ipso facto,</hi> to enjoy all Ordinances; yet take Elders or Ministers, and Church Governours as such; and they cannot be supposed to have it simply as Members of the Church Catholick, nor have they it from their having Gifts. The Law of Nature they cannot plead, why they should have that power, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than other Persons in the Church; and Christ's Charter immediately they have, not as naming their Persons. From whence then must it be, that they have their power as Elders, but from an Instituted Relation? This must be then some other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Right and Priviledge given them. They are given to the Church, and so their Rise must be from their Relation to a Church; and by the same Reason, the extent of the Jurisdiction of their Office, must depend upon the like; for what else should give them power over these, or these Churches, and not others? As it is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted by some, that the power is given to Saints, yet not to Saints, but as formed up into Bodies; so those that will say, it is given to Elders, must at least acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it is given to Elders, as knit into Bodies, and set over such formed Bodies. So as their Jurisdiction doth depend upon a Relation to, and a rise of call, either from that Body, or at least into that Body. Which is more evident upon this further Reason, than that forementioned will reach to. Because God makes not Elders, immediately by his providential converting and working on them, for so he makes Saints; and yet he gives not (say our Brethren) the power to them, but as united into an order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Body by Institution, in which they exercise each to other. And the case of Elder's
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:154381:56"/> power, is more depending upon an Order and Institution; because they are called to be Elders by a Designation of Men. Their being Elders, at least, is in order to a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not by a providential immediate working on them, or from God's giving them gifts; or by an immediate call, as the Apostles were chosen, afore God erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Church, to that end to erect it. There must be formed Bodies, to give a Rise to their call, by designing and accepting them; and there must be a relation to those formed Bodies, which they are set over; which must be set out by Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which alone maketh Elders, and gives them their power; and so the Rise of their call and their jurisdiction, is commensurable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I argue from the necessity of the thing it self. Necessary it was, that the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive power of Elders, should be determined (as well as the intensive) either by God or Man. If by God, we have what is desired. If by Man, either by the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates (and they were not Christians, for above Three Hundred years after Christ) or by the Elders themselves, and the Churches, as they should agree it. Now see the inconvenience to leave this part of extensive power, to be determined by Men; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Elders themselves, whilst Christ should take on him to determine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the other. Of all sort of power, Church power is that wherein, when Men have any part, or any pretence to it, they are more apt to be ambitious of extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, than any other: Witness the Ambition of the Prelates, and the Usurpation of the Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And they are as apt to usurp an undue power in the extension of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, as well as unlawful intensive Authority, as we have seen in Popes and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: The latter have assumed an undue extensive power, over whole Diocesses, Archbishops over Provinces, and Primates over Nations; and Popes have Usurped such a power over the Universal Church. This too large power they have all challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, as well as too much intensive power, by which the Bishops appropriate Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to themselves, which Presbyteries (say they) may not do; and the Popes lay a claim to Infallibility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now our Presbyterian Brethren, quarrel at that power in Bishops, and the Bishops oppose that Universal extensive power in the Popes. Now the Pope challengeth this intensive power of Infallibility, but upon this right, that having such Universal Extensive power, as the Apostles had; therefore God hath enabled him (as in that case he did the Apostles) with an Infallibility, suitable to that large extent of power; and therefore he began his Usurpation, with the pretence on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at first, to an Universal Power for extent, in his Title of Universal Bishop; and that brought on the other, and crept up with it, and is supported by it, as the Ivy is by the Elm. Thus <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, being Lord of all the World in his own Opinion, flattered himself into the conceit of Divinity, and of being a God, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to that Crown Universal. So that Men are as apt to err this way, as the other, and as dangerously in the consequence. It was therefore as necessary, that Christ should set bounds to the Usurpation of Men (who were to be trusted with Church-power) as to any thing else, it was necessary to prevent the claim of any one (as of Bishops) to determine the form of Government in the Church, not to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical; it was necessary to prevent impertinent intermedling in Officers, to set the proper bounds of each several Officer. It was necessary to prevent a Lording over the Flock, by setting down the Acts of Government, proper to Elders. And so that a stretching themselves beyond their Line, and an intermedling Authoritatively in Churches, not in their Jurisdiction might be prevented, it was needful be set down by certain Limits, the Territory of Church Government, seeing as true a Tyranny and Lording, might equally arise over the Church, by an undue extent of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as by the exercise of unlawful and new invented Acts of Church Power. And all this was the rather necessary, because that if it had been left to common Rules (as other things of outward order are) and by Humane Prudence to be shared and divided, the Clergy themselves, and Elders of Churches, were like to Arrogate the Determination hereof, (as in all Ages, they have done) and if they themselves were to be the allotters of it; they would be sure to look to their share, and that Wisdom (they would have it left to) would be sure to cast it so, and mould the frame of the power of Jurisdiction, into such an Order, as should advance and set up their power over all the Churches. And herein the whole Multitude of Elders and the Clergy, are as apt (yea, more apt) to be tempted, as a few Prelates that usurp it singly, because the Dominion extends to the <hi>totum genus the whole kind</hi> of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:154381:57"/> them. Meet therefore it was, that the Lord Jesus himself should fix this, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it as much as any thing else that he hath done.</p>
                  <p>Then 3. As to the bounding the Churches or Bodies of Saints and Elders, that should be the Seat of Church Power, it agrees with all reason, that Christ should keep this to him, as a part of his Prerogative; and that it should depend on his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority. It cannot be denied, but that (as was said) for a company of Saints to be a distinct fixed Church within themselves, and so to be the Seat of either the Ordinances for Worship or Government, is a superadded priviledge to their being Saints. If Pastors and Teachers be Ordinances, and the gift of Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. then to be Churches, and the Priviledges thereof, in and by means of which, the Saints come to have a propriety in these; and a special relation unto these, is a gift also, and so dependeth electively upon God's Will; and so is the Subject of Institution, as well as any other thing. And these Churches of Saints, are not only the object of Government, and in that respect the Seat of it; but the priviledge of Government, the endowment thereof is in a special manner conferred on the Churches, who are the Seat of it; and thereunto is the grant primarily made, and unto them the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit redounds. Thus in Civil Bodies, that are the Seat of Government, the Priviledge and Charter of having a Government, respects the whole community it self princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, and not the Officers; and therefore it is called the Corporation's, the Town's, or the Citie's Charter; and not the Mayors and Aldermen. As therefore the main Institution or Charter, falls on the Seat it self; and so upon the Officers, and the power in them for them; and indeed on both, by one and the same Appointment: So answerably the Scripture Stile runs still upon the Church, taking in the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Elders and People <hi>(So I ordain in the Churches,</hi> &amp;c. says the Apostle) because that is the Seat, the Subject of the Priviledge; and so of that Institution, that bestows and endows it. Yea, and therefore the promise of Christ's Blessing and Presence, is made to the Church, that is the Seat of Government <hi>I will be present says Christ, in the midst of you,</hi> &amp;c. which if it should be Interpreted of a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Elders; yet it must be as relating to a Church, that is their Seat; and to which they have a special Relation, and so by vertue of the promise made to the Church it self, Christ walks in the midst of the Candlesticks, which are the Churches. And the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of this Government and Censures therein, depends upon a special blessing; and the promise of a special Blessing, is always the companion of his own Institution. As no Acts of Government, but such as are instituted, have the ordinary promise of Blessing, nor in the Hands of any other than such as Christ hath given the power unto, so all is confined too within that Seat, or extent of Jurisdiction he hath appointed; and upon this ground, he is specially present with those Officers, and those Acts in relation; and in a respect to that Body or Church, whose Elders they are, and to whom the promise is principally made, and upon whom the Priviledge and Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on chiefly falls. In this respect then, it must also as much belong to his Power and Prerogative, to set out some Bounds and Limits of these Churches, as to Institute and Appoint, that there should be Churches that should have such a priviledge. And the reason is, because the Greatness and Worth of the Priviledge, doth more or less depend upon the ordering the extent and bounds of that Church; and will accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly more or less, redound to the good and benefit of the Saints therein, as these are set and ordered. And therefore it was fit that the Saints should owe this to none but the Wisdom of Christ himself; yea, nothing concerns the substance of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge more; and therefore if the priviledge it self be from Christ, then this also. Take any incorporate Body, if it be a priviledge to any such Body, to have Officers and certain Acts of Government appointed for and over them, then it is as much so too, to have also a circumscription of Jurisdiction among themselves, as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate. Yea, their priviledge and the benefit of it, depends so much upon it; that according to the ordering thereof, it is rendred greater or lesser, or perhaps made as good as void; so that all depends upon the set Determination of it, and had need therefore to be set out by the Founder, as distinctly as any thing else. The bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of all priviledges, depends upon bounds of enclosure, which if left common, the priviledge is impaired. The priviledge of such a Body lies, that inclusively they should have such a Government and Officers within themselves; and also exclusively be free in such and such cases, from the Jurisdiction of others, and if there be not something of either of these, there is no benefit or priviledge in having such a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:154381:57"/> or Officers; and yet neither of them can be accomplisht, unless the extent of the Seat of Government it self, and Jurisdiction thereof, be set out and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. And if so much of the priviledge depends hereon, (as apparently it doth) should not he appoint, and set out the Limits of these Bodies, who is the Author, Giver, and Bestower of the Priviledge it self; to whom these Societies should wholly owe it, and not to the Discretion of others; and who also takes on him as his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, to appoint both the Acts of Government, and Affairs for it, and form of Government they should be Ruled by, the one being of as much consequence, as the other. Thus the proportion of the greatness of the priviledge and benefit of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, so much depending on it, it is meet, yea, necessary that he that is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this Government, should define and fix it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I shall further add another thing, which depends upon the former, that the Efficacy of all Ecclesiastical Power and Censures, and the Efficacy of them depending on so Supernatural a Blessing, to subject the Conscience unto those Censures (against which Men's Consciences are apt to be as obstinate and rebellious, as to any kind of punishment inflicted by Men) if it was as necessary that Christ himself should set out the bounds of Jurisdiction, within the compass of which, Men were to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to those whom he betrusted with the Government, as to appoint any of those other things forementioned. For Men were like to quarrel at nothing more, than the right of power in those that executed it; and nothing was more liable to exception, than is this. They still might say, what have you to do to Judge me; unless you can shew from Christ, I am in the way of your Jurisdiction? Yea, how else also should it be known to whom it belonged, and over whom to execute these Censures; and who were in fault, if they were not Executed? The Apostle therefore stirs up the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to it, as a Duty belonging to them; and convinceth them of their sin (on whom it lay, and on none else) that they neglected to censure that offender, who was within their Jurisdiction, do not ye Judge them that are within? says he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. And so far as the Sword of the Spirit is not managed by that Hand, where Christ hath placed it, it will be naked. And if so much of the Blessing depends upon other things of as small moment, as upon the True Form of Government, that Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that is, to be Administred by the many (as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks) and not by one Man, a Bishop, and by Men in Office, and not the People only, though many (as our Brethren will say, in so much as for want of these, some of them do account the Act Null and Void, and to have been weakned, and as a wodden Dagger) Surely of these Censures, it may as well be imagined, they might receive a proportionable strength from the Addition of the like Institution of the extent of Jurisdiction, over those that should be within the reach of them, these being Acts of the power of Jurisdiction, as they have been commonly called in distinction from those other of Doctrine, and the Sacraments. Sure we are that <hi>Paul</hi> seems to put as much of the promise of the power to accompany it upon this, that the Incestuous <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian,</hi> was within the Jurisdiction of the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> and so had the promise of Christ's power, to accompany that ordinance to that Man, as upon any thing else. For Christ still blesseth his own ordinance, when in that right hand he hath placed it, and it may well be thought one, if not the main reason, why the edge of this Sword hath been found so blunt and dull (as <hi>Laure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tius Andreas</hi> observes) that there hath been more power in one Excommunication in the Primitive Times, than in all since, though backt with the Civil Sword, because it hath been in them, that have not had the right of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction to execute it; that whereas <hi>Tertullian</hi> says, it was in their Congregations, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fulmen, as a Thunderbolt,</hi> it hath been, <hi>Brutum fulmen, to us a Thunderbolt of no force, Nulla Major nullitas quam defectus juris, nec Major defectus quam Jurisdictionis; There is no greater Nullity, than a Deficiency of Right, nor a greater Defect, than that of Jurisdiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Conclusion of the whole, I infer, from this Assertion are chiefly these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That our Brethren of the Presbyterian way, if they would prove and

That an Instituted Church, according to the true and lawful Bounds thereof, being the Seat of the Priviledge, all power of Elders and Officers is to be drawn down thereto, in the exercise thereof; and in case of Defect, Elders are to be chosen to such a Church, and not that Church taken in to other Elders; and also all Acts of Jurisdiction, are to be exercised therein.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THis is agreed upon by all hands that some particular Church is such a Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Body, as hath intire power to cast out by Excommunication; and a casting out of that particular Body, Is consequently a casting out of all the rest, by the Law of Communion of Churches, whether implicite, (one Church reverencing the judgment of another, till they see apparent cause to the contrary) or explicite by vertue of that their Association. Now the Question is, what particular Body or Church it is, whether a fixed Congregation (whereof a Man is a constant Member) when it hath a sufficiency of Elders over it, or a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of many Congregations?</p>
                  <p>Proposition, <hi>One single Congregation of Saints, having a sufficient number of Elders, and Officers, is an intire Seat of all Acts of Government, and of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self, as well as of Worship.</hi> The truth of this Proposition will appear, if we consider the following Arguments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> I. If such a Church with the Elders are sufficient to Try and Examine, and so Admit ordinary Members, without the help of other Churches, then it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to cast them out. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The one is an affirmative act, the other a negative act, but both are acts of the Keys only turning several ways, the one opening the other shutting; the one is but judging initial Repentance, the other is a judging of occasional Repentance for a gross Sin. And there is as much reason you should require as evident signs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from the state of Nature, as you do in case of scandal. For as to men grown up, till they shew Repentance, there is this prejudice against them, that they are Children of Wrath by nature even as well as others.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:154381:59"/> 2. The not admitting of Men to Church Ordinances, and not receiving them, is an act of as great moment to Men's Persons, as to be cast out. If then Churches be betrusted with the one, why should not they be betrusted with the other?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Excommunication were more to the Man Excommunicated, than a not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving by way of Admission, yet Christ's Honour is as much concerned in what Members are taken in and owned for his Body, as in what are cast out.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In all Common-wealths, to Enfranchise and to cut off belong to the same Power, yea to Enfranchise doth more appertain to it. For Parliaments only do En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchise Strangers, but yet lower Courts do cut Men off by Death, according to the Law. And it holds in all Bodies else, for in Families, they have power to take in Servants, and power to cast out, and in Colledges to Admit and to Expell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But it will be objected, that to Excommunicate a Man, is to cast him out of all Churches, and therefore it is the greater Act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That simply alone doth not make it greater; for a Man is cast out of all Churches, not formally but only consequently, because the Churches have and hold communion one with another. Let the proportion be held between Admission and Excommunication in this, and they will be parallels; For if you will say that all Churches about have an interest, because they are to reject a Man, that is Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; so they have an interest also in Admission, to Receive him also, if he be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and they cast a reflection up that Church he is of, if they Receive him not by vertue of his Fellowship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. A Man in being so admitted into a particular Church, by vertue of that Fellowship, he is received occasionally into communion with any other Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> II. If a single Congregation may Suspend from the Sacrament, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting others, then they may Excommunicate. This is evident,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From Presbyterial Principles, for those that hold Excommunication to be but a casting one off from Communion with the Church, and not to include a further thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a formal delivering him unto Satan, do make but a very small difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Suspension and Excommunication. A Man Excommunicated they will admit to Hear, and therefore his being cast out of the communion of the Church, is but a depriving him of the communion of the Lord's Supper, and that is also done by Suspension: Only the one is but a Suspension from a few acts, this from many; but both are till he repents.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that the consequent of Excommunication, is to avoid civil converse, which is more than Suspension. We reply, that even so it is in Suspension also; for there is to be a withdrawing from a Brother, that walks inordinately before he is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 6. Yea, because a private Brother ought to withdraw converse with such an one, it is made a ground of Suspension from the Lord's Supper by the Church, that the Church should withdraw communion with him, and so Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Add to this, That they who are a Politick Church, having a sufficient Presbytery and Eldership, have a power to do all acts of a Church, and therefore to Excommunicate. But such a Congregation is a Politick Church, and have a sufficient Presbytery and Eldership.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are a Politick Church, and the least Church hath thus much power, that he that hears it not, let him be as an Heathen and a Publican, and the greatest hath no more. All the Churches in the World may add Advice in difficult cases, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential Authority, but they cannot add Power, for that Christ hath given to a Church as it is a Church. The Presbyterial Divines themselves do argue the Power of Excommunication in a Presbytery, because it is a Church; only they say a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is an imperfect Church. Whereas there is not one Scripture in the New Testament that doth so much as call a Presbytery, over many Congregations, a Church or if it did, there is then a greater thing to be proved (namely, this distinction which the Scripture hath not made) that a Congregation having an Eldership, is an incompleat Church Politick, and the other compleat. All Churches may be imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in respect of Moral Power, in some cases, wherein they need advice, and so a Presbyterial Church may be imperfect, and may run into errour, and so may a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, so may a National, so may a General Council. And if the imperfection of a Church should lie in this, that it is subject to another Church, and accountable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto (according to Presbyterial Principles) then also a Provincial and a National
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:154381:59"/> Church were imperfect, and by that rule they also should not Excommunicate. But in a word, the imperfection of a Congregational Church must lie, either in respect of what they are as a Church, or in respect of their Eldership.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their imperfection doth not lie in their being a Church, for they have more of Church than any classical Meeting of Elders hath, because they have both People and Elders also, and so partake of both sorts, which the other doth not. And the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have in their vote acknowledged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. to intend a particular Church, and the Eldership thereof to be a Church, although they do not acknowledge it only to be a Church, and our Reformed Writers call Congregations, <hi>Ecclesiae primae,</hi> the first Churches</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither doth their imperfection lie in their Eldership, as being insufficient, for if so, then either Elders are not an Eldership unto them for acts of Government; or they are not a sufficient Eldership for all acts of Governments. But</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are an Eldership or Presbytery unto them for acts of Government. For where there are more Elders than one united in common, for acts of Government, there they are an Eldership or a Presbytery, but so there are here. This is evident in the instance of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> brought by the Assembly themselves, for they therefore prove Presbyterial Government, over many Congregations, because those Elders met for acts of Government, and that those many Congregations were one Church to those Elders. Now in a particular Congregation, where there are more Elders than one, there is one Church, and there are likewise the Elders thereof, meeting (say we) with that Church for Acts of Government, and that may meet apart (say they) for some Acts of Government. Of a Bishop it is said, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>If he do not Rule his own house well, how shall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> That is to rule it, as the answering of one phrase to the other imports. And surely, if, by Bishop there, be meant a particular Elder, having relation unto a particular Congregation, Ruling in that Congregation is there intended, and to suppose that the House of God, that he is to take care of and to rule, is many Congregations, as met in a Classes, is too hard a supposition, especially seeing the Argument is taken from ruling his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and he is placed in a Congregation; and if the Congregation should not be meant here, by the House of God, the comparison went <hi>per saltum, by too wide a Leap.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the Name Church, is applied to the House of Meeting in our Language to this day, so this is an Argument that Congregational Meetings are Churches, and so the Name <hi>Rector,</hi> which imports Ruling, continues also to this day. Presbyters <q>(saith <hi>Bains)</hi> in antient time were in great difference, or of a double sort, those <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bain's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocesan tryal, Pag.</hi> 66.</note> who are called, <hi>Proprij Sacerdotes, Rectores, Seniores, Minorum Ecclesiarum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positi.</hi> The Bishop had not, nor challenged not that respective power over them, which he did over those who were numbred among his Clerks, who were helps to him in the Liturgy, in Chappels and Parishes which did depend on him, as their proper Teacher, though they could not so ordinarily go out to him. The first sort had power within their Churches, to Teach, Administer, Excommunicate, and were counted Brethren to the Bishops, and called <hi>Episcopi</hi> or <hi>Coepiscopi</hi> even of the Antient; But the Presbyters, which were part of their Clergy, they had this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective power over them, (indeed) the Canons Ecclesiastical allowing the same. And this power, in their own Congregations, these Rectors had, although they were <hi>Minorum Ecclesiarum praepositi, Rulers over lesser Churches.</hi> And surely they, that are fit to Teach their own Congregation, are fit to Govern their own Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: The word to <hi>Feed the Flock,</hi> implying, feeding them by Ruling, as well as by Teaching. They that are Parents to beget, have power of the Rod betrusted to them; and if they be fit to govern <hi>foro interno,</hi> then much more with others <hi>foro externo.</hi> It is a more Apostolical Work to beget, and to plant, and to multiply, than to Govern Men being converted. That those that should be fit to gather a Church, and to bring it to fulness from small beginnings, should not be fit to govern it, and to reap the fruit of it, but that the power should be in others that are extrinsecal to their Congregations, is absurd to think.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the classical Government, if they admonish not personally only, <hi>i. e.</hi> each Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister apart, but as a body in common then they meet for Acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that in common, as united: And if there be no admonition in common, wherein they all join, as an act of authority of the whole, then such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions proceed from the Minister alone, that doth admonish, and the other Elders therein are but as Cyphers. Now therefore when there is Elders, and these Elder
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:154381:60"/> united in acts in common, and those acts are acts of Government, there must needs be an Eldership. And this the Reformed Churches do acknowledge, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in ther papers, do own this to be an Eldership. The Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, in <hi>France,</hi> call it a Presbytery; and the meeting of the Elders over many Congregations, that they call the <hi>Classis.</hi> And what doth make a Classical El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership to be a Presbytery; but that materially there are Elders, that have relation to those Congregations, and that formally they are united for Acts in Common?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is as evidently true, that they are a sufficient Presbytery. Its true indeed, (as was said afore, no one <hi>is sufficient for any of these things?</hi> And thus for moral imperfections, power might be taken from the Apostles themselves, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this imperfection of themselves; but they have a political sufficiency.</p>
                  <p>For 1. If it be said that the insufficiency lies in the fewness of the number, and that in a Classical Presbytery, there are more; on answer to that, the Rule saith, <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church,</hi> and so speaks of them indefinitely; and our Saviour Christ saith, in Mat. 18. <hi>Where two or three are gathered,</hi> which the Presbyterial Divines do Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret of the Elders. In <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1. there are three Elders mentioned at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and that they ordained two Apostles, <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who (say our Brethren) acted as ordinary Elders, when joyned together in the same Act, and yet they ordained also, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. Thus the Church of <hi>Colosse,</hi> had two Ministers, <hi>Epaphras</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chippus,</hi> and yet that Church was compleat, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 10. And they were but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; for they were Pastors to them, <hi>who is a Faithful Minister to you,</hi> (saith he) and that in respect of Teaching; for (he saith) <hi>they had heard it from him, Col.</hi> 4. And when the Scripture hath not put the sufficiency upon a number, why, if there be but two, should they be excluded? And then too it may fall out, that as many El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are in one Congregation, as in some Classes. It will not be denyed by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that two Churches may associate, and make a <hi>Classis;</hi> and one Congregation may have as many Elders, as these two smaller ones, that do associate. And assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly their sufficiency doth not lie, that they have relation unto many Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for that this should have the influence into their sufficiency, is hard to be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; besides that this is but a secondary Relation, for the primary Relation is to their own several Churches, insomuch, as it was sometimes affirmed by our Brethren, that they were not Elders to all those several Congregations associated, but an Eldership only. And that is but an extrinsecal relation neither, whereas that relation, they have to their own, is more intrinsecal; because they are chosen by them, and because they personally watch over them, and are fixed amongst them, whereas this is but rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a meer Association. And therefore this relation that they are Elders over, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations can add nothing to their sufficiency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or else Secondly, their insufficiency is supposed to lie, in not having all sort of Elders, in this Congregational Eldership, both a Pastor, Teacher, and Ruling Elder. But if so, then a Classical Eldership may be imperfect too; for in some of these, one that hath the Office of a Teacher or a Doctor, may be, is often found wanting; or what if all Ruling Elders were wanting, and only Pastors met, were this an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Eldership? And if all sorts and kinds of Elders, were necessary to make up the sufficiency of an Eldership or Presbytery Classical; then it were first necessary that every Congregation should have all these sorts of Elders; for a <hi>Classis</hi> cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the Congregations under them, that some should have a Teacher, others a Ruling Elder, others a Pastor, to make up all sorts among them; and besides the first rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Officers, being unto particular Congregations, as being primarily ordained for them (for none is an Officer simply, made for a Classical Church) therefore the Seat of all these sorts of Officers, is Congregations: And so if that the <hi>Classis</hi> have all, it is because the Congregations have all first; and if the Classes be bound to have all to make theirs sufficient, the Congregations also are bound to have all to make theirs sufficient.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or else thirdly they are supposed Deficient, because they want Ability.</p>
                  <p>But 1. If they are Elders of the Church Universal (as some of our Brethren af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm) and of all the World; and accordingly fit for any work of Elders, as their Office is, it were strange that a company of them in a Congregation, two or three, or more, should not be fit for all the business in that Congregation.</p>
                  <p>But 2. Their inability must lie either in want of skill, or want of power. If in want of skill, it must be either skill to discern the proof of the Fact, for which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:154381:60"/> Men are to be excommunicated; and if so, then they are unable to Admonish also; for they should not Admonish, but upon proof of the fact; and to disable a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, People and Elders, to do that, which any Jury of a few Men use to do, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in point of Life and Death, <hi>is very</hi> hard. Or else their want of skill must lie in discerning, whether the sin be a sin of that Nature, that it deserves Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication for the matter of Fact, if it be not repented of; but they cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to want skil in that, for then they cannot likewise suspend from the Sacrament, for they are to suspend but for such sins, as, if not repented of, would deserve Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. Or else they must want skill to judge of Repentance, or the want of it; but surely if a Brother may be able to Judge of the Repentance of a Brother, in case of a flagitious sin (which in publick he should be Excommunicated for, if he Repented not) then a Church and these Elders, may be able to Judge of his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Publick sins. Yea, if a particular Eldership (according to Presbyterial prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) do find that the Man Repenteth upon their Admonition, though the sin be gross and heinous, they may forbear to bring him to the <hi>Classis,</hi> and receive him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, or else their Admonitions are in vain; and all must be brought however to the <hi>Classis.</hi> And if they may Judge of his Repentance, so as to prevent Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then they may as well judge of his Repentance, or of his Obstinacy, when he is to be Excommunicated.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that the fault may be so Atrocious, that they cannot so well judge of his Repentance; the Answer is,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Then all such sins should be brought immediately to the Classical Presbytery, and not to the particular Eldership at all; for them to Admonish, or to deal with him in order to Repentance.</item>
                     <item>2. The more Heinous the Fault is, the more apparent it is; and therefore the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they may judge of it, and the easier an Excommunication should be for it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Or 2. Their Insufficiency must be supposed to lie in want of power.</p>
                  <p>But 1. If they be a Presbytery in a Church, they must needs have Power and Authority to do all that a Presbytery is ordered for, or is ascribed to it. A Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Presbyterial Acts, are Relative and Mutual.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All Christ's Ordinances and Means, are sufficient unto his end. As a Minister, if he be a True and Lawful Minister, hath sufficiency both of Gifts and Power, to do what belongeth unto him as a Minister; as to Acts of all sorts, and the least, as well as the greatest: So if Christ do Ordain a Presbytery, to Govern as a Presbytery, it is a perfect means for all Presbyterial Acts; for God's Appointments are perfect, and God's means for Government, are as compleat as his other means of Preaching and the Sacraments. A Presbytery, if it be a Presbytery, is as perfect, as a Presbytery, as a particular Minister, is as a Minister. A Minister, is a compleat Minister, not to Preach only, but to Baptize; not to Baptize only, but to Administer the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; not to Preach one part of the Council of God, but all; not to Administer the Bread only, but the Cup; and if he is the Minister of one Sacrament, then also of another; for there are no such Ministers as the Bishops, Deacons. Now look what a Minister is in his kind, that Elders are in their kind, and if they have power to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish, then power to Excommunicate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they be fit for one Act of Government, then for all Acts, of all sorts and kinds (for of them we speak now) we do not say in all cases; for a case may be too diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for them, and then they seek Advice, but we speak of the kinds. If they be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they have the power, in one as well as the other, which is proved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because our Presbyterian Brethren's own Arguments, do run from instances of one part of Government, to all. They cannot give Instances of all Acts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment done by those, that they suppose to be Classical Churches; but they argue from some few, and those less than Excommunication, as in the instance of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they argue from the less, from having received Alms, that they meant to prevent a Scandal. Yea, they argue that because the Synod in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. might with an Authority Doctrinal declare, that therefore they might Excommunicate. So we argue, if a Congregational Presbytery may do all these, then they may Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; and it is their right to do it. Our Presbyterian Brethren, can give no instance of any one that did all; and until they have an Instance, that Classical Churches did all these, it may still be said, that Classical Churches be imperfect; and how then shall they or we, know what is a perfect Presbytery, and what is not? To give them power
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:154381:61"/> to Admonish, to Suspend from the Sacrament, and not to Excommunicate, is to make them imperfect. If then they are furnisht with power, they must likewise have Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for what Christ gives power to do, to that he gives ability sufficient.</p>
                  <p>If it should be said, that Congregational Elders do but Govern in <hi>foro interno,</hi> I answer 1. That's the same that the Bishops allowed, only unto Pastor of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, affirming themselves had only the external Judicature. Then 2. They rule more than in <hi>foro interno,</hi> for they set up an outward Judicature in a Church of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, united in common, even while they Admonish in common, and suspend from the Sacrament in common.</p>
                  <p>So that to conclude this Argument, to say that they are insufficient for Ability and Power; it is 1. A wrong to Christ, in Reproaching his means, as insufficient to his ends. It is 2. A wrong to the Presbytery it self; it is enough to take away the power from them; but to take away a Man's power and his Estate, and make him a Ward under pretence, that he is not able to manage it, or hath no power to do it, is the greatest wrong that can be. 3. If some Elders and Congregations be found insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, then they are insufficient to be Elders, put them out, or let them only be Wards, shall the Law be general for their sakes? 4. If you ask what is a sufficient Eldership? We ask you what is an insufficient? And wherein insufficiency lieth? And let not Churches be kept imperfect (when it is their due to have a sufficient Eldership) that under the pretence of that, the necessity of Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may appear. But as in case of Separation, the Assembly hath affirmed, that if there be a want of officers, or the like, it is required that there be a supply, and that there be not a Separation; so in Congregations, let there be a sufficient Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, let there be a supply, let not the power be taken away. For thus the Bishops took away Ruling Elders, and did leave but one Pastor in a Congregation, that so they might have the better pretence to govern, and to do all themselves.</p>

And that such a body thus compleat, should not have all power that a body can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have over its Members, is very strange. And again; that power and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is to be given to every brother in his proportion, is to be given to every compleat body of Christ, in the like proportion as it is a body. Now every brother hath power as a brother (and as it is his Duty) to withdraw from him he doth judge to walk inordinately, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 5. And then every body that is rightly organized, must therefore have power as a Body, to a suitable proportion, to cut off any rotten Member; and if it can heal it self, to do it of it self, the Law of Nature will teach it, as it is a Body so to do. That is not a sound Body, that hath not strength to purge out it's own Excrements. All Bodies and Societies of Men, have power still within themselves, to cast out any who are Destructive to the Society, so Families have, (eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lump purgeth out its own Leaven) and every particular Company in a Greater Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have that power so far as their own company reacheth.</p>
                  <p>The power which the Synagogues had and exercised, Congregations surely may have now. The <hi>Synedrim</hi> might give the Law in the Abstract directing, who and what kind of Persons were to be cast out, and for what; but they medled not with the particular Sentence, and applying of it to any Man; nor did the Towns and Cities that judged in their Gates. Neither were the Synagogues bound to advise, but only when the case was difficult, which is clearly by this; that the <hi>Jews</hi> had Synagogues in all the Cities of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> dispersed up and down the World, and had their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:154381:61"/> Rulers in them; and they were not bound to come up to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> to the <hi>Synedrim.</hi> These Synagogues, though they could not cast out of the Temple, yet cast out of themselves they might; and therefore a Man was cast out of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</p>
                  <p>As we argue in the case of Baptism of Children, that God hath not straitned, but rather inlarged his Grace, and the Liberty and Promises thereof under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; so we do argue here, that the liberty of such Assemblies, (as the Synagogues were) which Christ hath now Instituted, must have all the priviledges they had, and so much the more, by how much, that the Assemblies of the Saints now are more No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than Synagogues were then; they being called a Temple, the House of God, a Holy Nation, and a Royal Priesthood; and upon every Assembly, under the Gospel, God Creating a Cloud and a Pillar of Fire, these have all the promises and priviledges, that the Temple and the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> had, therefore surely as much as the Synagogues. The Prophet <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3. 16. makes the priviledge of every Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, to be as great as that of the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> where the Ark was, the place where God did choose for the <hi>Synedrim</hi> to sit in, and to govern that Nation. <hi>In those days,</hi> (saith he, speaking of the times of the Gospel) <hi>they shall say no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord</hi> (which therefore must needs be meant of the times of the Gospel; for the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord, was the chiefest priviledge, under the Law, till Christ) neither <hi>shall it come into mind, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall they remember it, neither shall they visit it, neither shall that be done any more;</hi> But in stead thereof, he takes one of a City, and one of a Family, and brings them to <hi>Zion,</hi> takes not the Nation, but Selects some out of the Nation; and gives them Pastors according to his own Heart, as a greater priviledge than that of rhe Ark, and therefore it is meant of Congregational Assemblies; for to them Pastors are fixedly and properly given to feed them with Knowledge and Understanding. And if that every Congregation enjoyeth a greater priviledge than the Ark of the Lord, in having such Pastors; then surely it should also be governed by them, as the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues also were by their Rulers, who were called Rulers of the Synagogue, not of the Synagogues; for each Synagogue had more Rulers than one, for the Government of them, as they were a Synagogue, <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 22.</p>

                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. If the Seat of Worship and Government be commensurable, and of equal extent: Then a single Congregation, as it is the Seat of Worship, so of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now for Worship, none else do meet but Congregations; and if the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Altar, and Worshippers, be measured by the same line, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. the power that is in the Temple, is likewise so measured. If Altar and Judicature, be of like extent also (as they are, since the end of Discipline is to keep Worship pure) then where the constant Worship is, there should be constant Discipline, especially if Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication be a part of Worship, as was said afore, as well as Admonitions are: It cannot be otherwise, but that the proceedings of the whole Discipline, Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all, should be before the whole Church, which is as well to be edified by it, as by Preaching; and therefore particular Congregations are to be the Seat of it: Thus we shewed before, that the main end of a Church was Worship, and that Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline was the Appendix thereunto, to keep the Worship pure; and that so Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, had made the bounds of a Church, to be measured by that of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Rev. 11. 1. <hi>Measure the Temple and the Altar, and the Worshippers;</hi> and so all that belongs unto it. And this Worship and Government for the State of it, are of equal extent, commensurable one to the other, which is made out by this; that all sorts of Churches that ever were, had Worship and Government of equal extent. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, when there was a Church in the House, and it went in a Family-way, as the Worship was in the Family, so the Disciple was in that Family; and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was a casting out of that Family; so in <hi>Adam's</hi> Family, it is said of <hi>Gain,</hi> that he fled from the presence of the Lord, that is, from his Father's House. When as God did make a Nation a Church, the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> (as 'tis called, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.) in the Wilderness, they did set all their Tents about the Tabernacle, and so, as one Church, they saw the Sacrifices. And when they were at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> they had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably a National Worship, they had Ordinances, as they were a National Church; therefore the <hi>Synedrim</hi> was to sit in the place that God should choose, to be there for Government, as well as he appointed the Sacrifices to be there. And for that Moral Worship in the Synagogues, so far forth, as they were the Seat of Worship, Prayer,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:154381:62"/> and reading the Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so they had also casting out of the Synagogues: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the <hi>Synedrim</hi> might make Laws, for what sins to do it; yet the exercise of it was by the proper Rulers, who are called therefore Rulers of the Synagogues. It is therefore <hi>Bains,</hi> his Argument against <hi>Diocesan</hi> Churches, that there could be no such Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bain's Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>san Trial, pa</hi> 69.</note> because there was no publick Ordinances of Worship, as was in the National Churches of the <hi>Jews,</hi> unto which the Males came. And yet the Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment kept up this principle, for as they had a Diocesan Government, so they had a Cathedral Worship in the same place, as in a Mother Church, like that Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Worship of Sacrifices in <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> and they had set meetings at them, to which all came up; and therefore their principles, in this, was better than this of the Presbyteries, for they had a Worship and a Government, that was commensurable.</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. The performing of Acts of Worship by a Minister, belongs to the power of Order; but the power of Jurisdiction is a further thing. A Minister may Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the Sacrament, and perform a work of Order alone; but he cannot Govern alone, but he must be joyned with others; and therefore Worship and Government are not commensurable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The question is not of the power, but of the extent of the State both of Worship and Government. He that is a Minister, and can alone perform an Act of publick Worship, yet he must do it in a publick Congregation; and so although it be done alone by his person, yet not beyond the extent of a Congregation, but still according to the limits and bounds of it. Now the Seat of Government, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, is commensurable to the Seat of Worship; so as although he cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an Act of Government alone in the Congregation, but with others; yet still those others are but to be those, who belong to that Congregation, whereto he is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or an Elder for performing Acts of Worship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The Apostles had a Latitude of power over all sort of Churches, and therefore the extent of Worship, and the power of Government, are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Although the Apostles had, in their Persons, power of Government over all Churches; yet still they exercised that power (for acts of censure) but when they were, in any of those Congregations, not in a consistory out of those Churches, but as personally present in the Churches. And therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>When I come, I will do so and so;</hi> and <hi>shall I come with a Rod?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 19, 20, 21. And when they came to any particular Church, it was an Apostolick priviledge proper to them, which is not communicable to other Elders, they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>fellow-Elders,</hi> (as <hi>Peter's</hi> Phrase is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.) in every one of those Churches; and did for that time concur in the Government of that Church, though with the interest of an Apostle. So as still <hi>de facto,</hi> the exercise of all their Government, was in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and as they Administred not the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper alone, or out of Churches, so nor did they Excommunicate, but as joyned with a particular Church; nor did they choose Officers or Elders, but as present with Churches, whom these were to be Officers to. They might give Doctrinal Directions to Churches, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Government, in which they were infallibly guided by the Holy Ghost; but acts of Government, they performed not, but in the Churches themselves, and as concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and becomming one with that particular Church; and therefore the Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as distinct Churches, notwithstanding they were under Apostolical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and many Churches are no where called one Church, because under an Apostle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. That a single Congregation, with it's Elders, is an intire Seat of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is proved from the Nature of Excommunication it self.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Excommunication relateth to Communion, and Communion with Churches is either fixed, and in a constant way, or occasional. To throw a Man out of occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion, is not Excommunication, it is but a secondary act, that supposeth first to throw him out of a fixed Communion. It is but Non-communion, or denial of Communion, and keeping of him out of it, as all other remote Churches may do. And the Execution of the act, is from the power of Christ; and that promise which he hath made, <hi>I will be in the midst among you, when thus gathered together,</hi> Mat. 18. 20. whereas the way of Presbytery classical Excommunication, is as if the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was gathered in the Name of the Pretbyters, and with their power; and that they could promise to be in the midst among them. Excommunication therefore, formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:154381:62"/> and properly is a casting him out of a fixed Communion; therefore that Church, which actually doth hold a fixed communion with him, hath that power, and to them properly must belong the casting of him out. <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within, saith the Apostle?</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. And so far as any were <hi>Within</hi> to them, so far they had Power over them. Now to that particular Congregation, whereof a Man is a Member, a Man is so <hi>Within,</hi> in respect of a fixed communion as to no Church else in the World; there is therefore a Power of throwing of him out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them, which belongs to no Church, nor unto all the Churches in the World. Other Churches can but throw him out of an occasional communion as he shall come to them, and therefore answerably, their throwing of him out must be but occasionally, as he shall at any time offer to come to them. Hence therefore the formal act of Excommunication must needs be proper unto them, whom he holdeth a fixed communion with. Add to this, that other Churches can throw him out, but of that communion which he holds with them, and the communion ordinarily, he holds with them, is but as being a Member of a Church associated with them (supposing such an association) and as far as their interest goes, so far their power may go, they may throw him out of their association, but no further. But Excommunication is a throwing of a Man out of a fixed communion of all Ordinances for Worship, now such a communion he holds not with other Churches. They may indeed throw him out of their own <hi>Within,</hi> which is, for the fixed part of it, but a matter of associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Government; but the Congregations, <hi>Within,</hi> are in respect of ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in Worship. Now answerable unto their Interest is their Power; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Excommunication is to take him from the midst of them <hi>(from among you,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 13.) with whom he did use to Worship. The very import of the word <hi>Excommunication</hi> is <hi>Excommuni caetu,</hi> the formal and direct act therefore of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is to throw him out of that fixed communion, which he had. It is a cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of all other Churches consequently, yea out of the visible Catholick Church consequently, but formally it is only out of that particular Church whereof he is a Member. Other Churches, by vertue of their communion together, may ratifie it by approving it, but that Church, which the act properly concerns in the formality of it▪ is a particular Church whereof he is a Member, and therefore answerably the formal power must lie there. And although this Government of Christ hath been never so much corrupted by a power set over Congregations, yet still the act of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (or at least the execution) hath been performed in the particular Churches whereof a Man is a Member.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where and by whom that act is done, that excommunicateth a Man, there the power and the main of the power must lie, (for the substance of the act) and there alone. But in particular Congregations, and by the Elders of the People thereof, that act alone is done, by which a Man actually is cut off from communion with all other Churches, and whereby he is excommunicated; Therefore that particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is the only, or at least the main substantial subject of that power, whereby a Man is excommunicated. We have an instance in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> when the Apostle directs them to deliver that Man unto Satan, when they were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Whether the Man was excommunicated, or no, it matters not, however the direction was given, and the direction falls upon the very act it self, when and where it was actually to be executed and done, and in them it puts the power; <hi>When ye are met together in the Name, and with the Power of the Lord Jesus, deliver such a Man to Satan,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5. There's the Act, and there's the Power, all meet together, and he speaks of the ultimate act of Excommunication; and where, and in what Meeting that is to be done amongst them, there the power resideth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In all Spiritual Ordinances, the power is inseparable from the act: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make the power whereby a Man is excommunicated to lie in one Assembly, and the act of excommunication to be performed in another, is to divide what Christ hath put together. He that baptizeth hath the power of baptizing, and he that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of preaching, and so those that actually excommunicate of excommunication, and the act is more than the sentence. If therefore they have the greater committed to them; they must needs have the less. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whom Jesus Christ betrusteth with the act, he must betrust them the power, because his power, whereof their's is but the execution, doth accompany their act, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, when you are <hi>met with the Power of the Lord Jesus, give</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:154381:63"/>
                     <hi>such an one unto Satan.</hi> It is not as in Civil cases, there the power lies in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but here in the Execution. And indeed the <hi>ultimate</hi> Sentence lies in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and is all one with it, when in the presence of all the Church it is said, <hi>We deliver this Man to Satan.</hi> And therefore,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In Scripture the Power is expressed by the Act. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Whom I did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto Satan;</hi> and so ordination is called the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery. The Power of the Presbytery is expresly their act; and therefore where the Act lies, the Power must lie.</p>
                  <p>Now we ask this Question, Whether a Man be actually Excommunicated and delivered up unto Satan, until he is so delivered up at a Meeting of that particular Church whereof he is a Member, Elders and People being present? We are not now inquiring what proceedings are to go before, preparatory hereunto; but this is that we contend for, that where the Act is done which <hi>ultimately</hi> Excommunicates him, there the substance of the Power lies.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it may be answered, that the Execution is in the Congregation, but the Sentence is in the Presbytery; as in Civil Courts it is where the Man is Sentenced by the Judges, but actually Executed by the Sheriffs. We reply,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Instances of Civil proceedings will not hold here. For the Sentence by the Judge is that authoritative Act, as by him that hath the Power in Law to cut the Man off; but to Execute the Man, to put him to Death, that's an act of Nature which any Man can do, though he, that doth it, is to do it lawfully, by vertue of the Sentence; but the Act, whereby the Man is in Law kill'd, is the Sentence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is from that time <hi>Civiliter Mortuus,</hi> dead in Law. But so it is not in this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual act of binding of Sin, and of delivering unto Satan; there must be a power, and an authority that is in the persons that doth accompany them, and that as met together. And the Execution of the Act is from the Power of Christ, and that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise which he hath made, <hi>I will be in the midst among you, when thus gathered together, Mat.</hi> 18. 20. Whereas the way of Presbyterial Classical Excommunication, is as if the Congregation was gathered in the name of the Presbyters, and with their Power, and that they could promise to be in the midst among them. And however there may be, many preparatory acts unto it, yet the thing is not done till it be done, by them that have the Power. And therefore if the Classical Presbytery will challenge it, they must all be present, but if the Congregation must do it, it is an evident argument that the power lies there.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Classical Presbytery had the power hereof, then when they do Sentence him to be Excommunicated, they ought actually to Excommunicate him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it, for to say that the power should be in them and not the act, when as those that do the act are to meet and gather together in the power of the Lord Jesus, is very inconsistent. If they do not actually Excommunicate, what they do must be only a doctrinal direction, that the Man deserveth to be Excommunicated, such as the Apostle put forth in case of neglect, when he gave his judgment, <hi>I have judged already</hi> (saith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) <hi>Let such a one be delivered unto Satan,</hi> &amp;c. But he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the power to be in them, for saith he <hi>Do not ye judge them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in?</hi> And therefore he saith not, I have <hi>delivered him,</hi> but <hi>that he be delivered.</hi> And it is in this as in case, suppose of Baptism, that a Minister had neglected his duty to Baptize one, and the Apostle had sent to him, to Baptize him, and given his Sentence, such a one should be Baptized, and should further press it, do not you Baptize such and such a one, do not you use to do it? So he speaks here, <hi>Do not ye judge them that are within?</hi> Do you not use to do it? Now as in this case, the question will be whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the power of Baptizing lay in the Apostle or in the Minister, that upon this doth Baptize? Certainly in the Minister, and he doth that by an immediate commission from Christ. For he that doth the substance of the Act, in him the power lies; though he may be directed in a case of neglect by an Apostle when alive. And so now tho' a particular Congregation in case of a neglect may be called upon, and urged by other Churches, yet still in the one case as in the other, in them the Power lies by whom the substance of the Act is done. Neither yet do we hereby intend to give that power to a Classical Presbytery that the Apostle had over <hi>Corinth,</hi> but only we alledge it thus far, that though the Apostle had Power to command now when absent, and if he had been present, had power to have concurred with them in the very act,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:154381:63"/> that yet still the power lay in them, without the Apostle, to have proceeded, by whom the Act was to be done according to the Apostle's direction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. According to Presbyterial practices, it is evident that the power is not in them, but in the Congregation; for after that they have Sentenced a Man to be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and it is to be supposed, that his sin is ripe for Excommunication; and that he is obstinate enough, to be now Excommunicated, then it should be presently act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and done, if the power were in them. But they stay the Execution of it, in the particular Congregation, for three days; they give him three Admonitions more, and the People are to pray for him; and so they do manifestly, <hi>de facto,</hi> hereby put the ultimate judgment of his impenitence into the Congregation, and the ultimate act of Execution also. For if the Man did Repent, they were not to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him; and because they judge him to continue impenitent, they do Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, according to the Presbyterial practices.</p>
                  <p>If it be answered, as it is by some, that the Sentence, by vertue of which he stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Excommunicated, is that of the Classical Presbytery, and that the Elders of the Congregation, are but the <hi>Praecones,</hi> they do not exercise the substance of the Act, only declare and publish it: Then we reply.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That here is more than a promulgation, not only because it is not presently done; but because other means of Admonitions, as Ordinances of Christ are apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, to bring him to Repentance; and if so, it is apparent, that when the Classical Presbytery Intended him to Excommunication, that he was then not fit for Excommunication; for why should these Authoritative Admonitions of his own Elders come afterwards? They may as well continue their Admonitions, publickly after his Excommunication. Now if his sin were not fit for excommunication, so as they might take it upon their Consciences, he ought not now to be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then by vertue of their Sentence, he is not excommunicated, when he is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; for they Sentenced him, when his sin was not ripe for it. So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own practices, they make the Presbyterie's act to be but a Doctrinal discernment, that in such a case, if he continues thus and thus obstinate, he is to be excommunicated. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That, which the Elders in the Congregation do, is more than to be <hi>Praecones</hi> of the Sentence of the Presbytery; and their delivering of him to Satan, actually, is more than a publishing, not only because they do Authoritatively as Elders, Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him after the Presbyterie's Sentence (and if they do Authoritatively Admonish him, certainly they do Authoritatively also excommunicate him after their Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if he continues impenitent) but also because when it is done, they call upon the Name of the Lord Jesus; and they do it in the Name, and with the power of the Lord Jesus. If it were a meer promulgation, there needed no invocation, as an act of theirs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, if the Form of the Sentence, whereby the Elders of the Congregation do excommunicate him, be considered, do not they say; <hi>We, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and with his power,</hi> deliver thee to Satan to excommunicate thee. Yea, were not that Congregation in <hi>Corinth,</hi> to do so, which the Man belonged unto? Whereas if the Classical Presbytery had the power, and these were only the publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; then the Classical Presbytery were only to use those words, because the power was in them; and the Ministers were only to declare, that such an one was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by them, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. And if so, then all the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of a Congregation are to the Classis, but even as Curates are to the Bishops: And indeed, the Bishop's principles are more consonant to themselves, than this; for they say, that the act of excommunication is done, and absolved, and perfected in their Courts; and that the Curate doth only promulge it (as their manner is) but that the Man is indeed excommunicated by the Bishop. But here there is a pretence of leaving the substance of the act, to be formally done and executed by the Elders of the Congregation; and yet a denial, that a power to do it lies in them; and the power to do it, assumed to be in them, who yet profess they do not actually excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If they were only <hi>Praecones,</hi> then any Man may do it, as well as the Elders of his own Church.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, that, in a Congregation it self, when it is done, it is done by one Man that pronounceth it, the Pastor of the place, or the like.</p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:154381:64"/>
                  <p> The answer is 1. That as in Prayer, when the Pastor is the Mouth of all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto God, he is but the Mouth of those People that are present, and do joyn with him; and it is their act, and not the act of Men absent: So it is here, in this act he is the Mouth of the Elders, and the whole Congregation as present, as of God to throw this Man out: But to make the Elders of the Congregation, and the whole <hi>Congregation,</hi> to be but the publishers of what the Presbytery hath done, when <hi>they</hi> were absent, this is indeed to make them meer publishers, which any Man may do, yea, they themselves may do it, by fixing it upon the Church Door.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> AS we prov'd, that the constitution falls upon particular Churches, by shewing how naturally all things fall out in that way; and what distorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in the other: So for the confirmation of the compleat power of particular Churches, for matter of Government, we shall now proceed in the like way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. For the upholding of the Subordinations of Congregational and Classical Assemblies; and of many Congregations, being under one common Presbytery, made up of the Elders fixed to several Congregations, the Presbyterial Divines are forced to invent multitude of distinctions and divisions, thereby to uphold their principles. They are forced to make one Church for Worship, and another Church meerly for Discipline, a Church Real, which is of the Saints, the Body of the Faithful, that are a Church to Christ; and a Church Representative in their Elders, meeting in a Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Assembly: A Church incompleat and imperfect (such they make Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:) A Church perfect and compleat for Government, (such they make a Classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Presbytery) yea, indeed as was observed before, they must make three sorts of Churches, to make up one. 1. A Church of the Faithful (for so the Brethren are called, in distinction from the Elders) 2. The Eldership of each Congregation, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative Church thereof; and 3. A Church Classical, the Elders of all those Congregations assembled in one. They must also be put upon finding out a double Presbytery, for ordering of Government; one Congregational, the other Classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; when yet they are not able to give one note or character of such distinction in the Scriptures. Yea further, to answer our Arguments, they have been fain to say, that the Elders of particular Congregations have the relation of Elders, in <hi>Sensu di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso,</hi> to each Congregation; but the Relation only of an Eldership, <hi>in sensu con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncto,</hi> as met in a Classical Presbytery, to all and each of these Congregations. And then also they must find out distinctions of the difference of Duties, what the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders owe to a particular Church; and what to all the Congregations in common. They must also make the same persons, to be Preaching Elders in the exercise of their Office, to their particular Congregations; and Ruling Elders also in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Office, to all the rest. And yet are not able to make any Foot-steps of any such distinction, or of any such boundary of Duties. And as the Reformed Churches, would not have made that distinction of those several sorts of Elders, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament, had they not had distinct and peculiar characters of some, that ruled, of others that especially laboured in the Word and Doctrine, Rom. 12. 8. <hi>He that Ruleth, let him wait on Ruling, he that Exhorteth on Exhortation, he that Teacheth, on Teaching.</hi> And unless they had found these Foot-steps of Distinction, bounding their several Offices, they would never have invented these several sorts of Elders; nor could they be able to maintain these several sorts without them. So if there cannot be found like warrant, for all the Presbyterian distinctions, can they be able to say, that Jesus Christ hath made these several sorts of Churches, and these various Reflections of Elders, and their Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus whilst to them, there are many Bodies, and many Churches; and Lords many, and Presbyteries many; our way is single, natural, uniform, and to us there is but one Church, one Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:154381:64"/> having mutual relation one unto another. One Church for the Seat of Worship, the same Church for the Seat of Discipline; and hereby all these groundless Distinctions are in a few words taken away.</p>
                  <p>Now as in the point of Institution of Congregational Churches, this uniformity is a confirmation to us, and the contrary is an evidence of the falseness of the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the other: So when the point of power cometh to be disputed, what shall belong to each Congregation, the observation of the like uniformity in ours, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stortion in theirs, confirmeth us that the power is compleatly and intirely in each Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, having a particular Eldership of it self. As before they are put to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, so now in this to part and divide the power between the Congregations, and these Classical Presbyteries; and that for ordinary Government. Their being out of the right way, produceth manifold distortions, their Administrations of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, differing from the Rules and Practices held forth by Christ, and his Apostles in their Epistles, unto which the placing the power wholy and intirely, and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in a particular Congregation, falleth uniform and suitable.</p>
                  <p>Presbyterial Divines, finding that particular Congregations were Churches, and that as such they are intended, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> for shame they could not take all power from them, but they must allot them some; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were a Church: And yet because they could not uphold the constant and ordinary intermedling (and that not by way of Appeal) of a classical Presbytery, which did challenge it's primary cognisance, and right in Excommunication, as well as the Congregations, however therefore they divided the power, and they put part of the power in one, and part in the other. They put the Sentence of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a classical Church, and the Execution of it in the Congregational; and so indeed they do make two sort of Governments ordinary, for one and the same suit or cause or matter, and person to be proceeded against. The particular Eldership of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation proceedeth so far, as to admonish, and to suspend from the Sacrament; and then when the Man is obstinate, the classical Congregation saith; bring him to us, ere you presume to Excommunicate him, that we may admonish him again, and so he may be found further obstinate; and then for the Execution, carry him down again to the Congregation, and let him be admonished, before all by the Elders thereof, and then again if obstinate Excommunicate him. Surely if to compleat Excommunication, there had been such divided proceedings in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. Jesus Christ would have said, <hi>Go tell the Churches,</hi> and not <hi>the Church▪</hi> for it cannot be denyed, but that these are distinct Churches, the Congregational and Presbyterial. Whereas to us, as there is but one Congregation and Presbytery, so but one compleat and intire Government, whereof that congregation is the Seat. And however the knowledge of the matter may be first given to the Elders, and by way of preparatory cognisance, they may consider of it, (to cut off accusations impertinent, and apparently defective) yet therein they proceed not by Authority; but all that they do in an authoritative way, is done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Congregation, to the edification of all; and so there is but one sort of publick proceeding, whereas our Presbyterian Brethren have many.</p>
                  <p>Now to Demonstrate the Distortions of Administrations in their way, and the Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of founding any such divisions and parting of Government and Proceedings, we present these considerations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. According to their own principles and practices, this division of power, and proceeding, to compleat an act of Government and Excommunication, is not parallel'd with, or uniform to the power and the proceedings, in those other Subordinances of Churches or Assemblies, which they would have erected for Government. It is known, that they make five several Subordinations. 1. Oecumenical. 2. National. 3. Provincial. 4. Classical. 5. Congregational. And all these are built but upon this one ground (the same that a Congregation puts in for) that they are all Churches; only the greater still having power over the lesser, as is affirmed, they are cast into these Subordinations. Now then let but the same be granted to Congregations in this its lowred condition; let it but have the same proportion of Subordination to it self, in comparison of classical, that the rest have one to another; let all these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignations, that consist of lower and upper Rooms, be but uniform in this Model; and then, until a Congregation doth miscarry in its Excommunication, it must needs have all the power within it self. For Classical and Provincial, which are the two next Subordinations, each to other, Provincial and National, do not divide a power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:154381:65"/> to compleat one act of Government between them; (so as the Classical should have one part, and the Provincial another; or the Provincial one part, and the Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal another; and so as after the lower hath performed his part, it should be brought to a higher, to compleat the Sentence) but each of them have an intire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat power, to perfect what they take in hand to Excommunication; and matters are carryed from one to another, but only by way of Appeal, and that too after they have compleated the Sentence and Execution; having full power to Excommunicate within themselves. Why then should the Congregational in its Conjunction and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, to and with a Classical Presbytery, be more injured, than all the rest? Why should the Classical alone put in to divide the Lands with them, and go half, and the greater half; and not suffer the Congregational to perfect, and compleat the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, as well as any of the other; and so all to be brought (if at all) only by way of Appeal to them? Whereas now all is brought to the classical Presbytery, from the Congregational, in a way of imperfection and deficiency of power, to compleat the Sentence. And this is the greater injury, in as much that one of the great Arguments, that (until of late, and of late also) hath been pleaded for the power of classical Presbyteries, and so of Synods, is but from the analogy of the Congregation's Right, that what power they have over a Brother, a Classis should have over a Congregation (as in our Kingdom, the Plea of Inheritance of the Eldest Son of a Yeoman, is the same with that of Nobles and Gentry; yea, and in the Throne it self) But why alone should the poor Congregations be made Coppy-Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when all the rest are free and intire in their own acts of Judicature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Presbyterian Brethren by this, makes two Courts of Judicature for one and the same cause; which is not ordinarily found amongst Men. It's true indeed, in Humane Courts, the lower have only lesser matters or faults committed to them, Debts of such a value; and Higher Courts have those that are of an Higher Nature, or a greater value. But look what matters are committed to them, they are able to pass a final and compleat Sentence upon them, and have power to execute it, if an Appeal be not made; and if once a Suit be put in, they have power to end it, else it is no Court. But here now the Congregational Elders, are allowed to intermeddle, and have Authority in all Causes, even those that are the greatest, and the most Heinous sins that deserve excommunication, without any controversie and difficulty; but then they are allowed to proceed but so far in it, and then to bring it to the Classical Assembly for Sentence, where all must be heard over again, ere they can proceed to a Sentence; and then it is brought to the People, and there it is acted over again. And thus as they make two sort of Churches, one for Discipline, and another for Government, and part the Seat of Government and Discipline; so for to compleat an act of one and the same Discipline, they make two several Courts; and that not by parting them, by distribution of causes of less and of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only; but of acts of Judicature. And whereas the Classis pretends, that it's the perfect and compleat Church, and the Congregational imperfect; according to these practices, it makes nothing more perfect, than the Congregational doth, as the Law did not; but when the case is brought to this same perfect Church, yet it is forced to send the party down again to the Congregational (which is the imperfect Church) there to have the Sentence compleated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whereas the Apostles, in their Rules for Publick Admonitions, do make them to be two or three, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 10. An heretique, after one or two Admonitions reject as obstinate: This way of proceeding makes three sort of publick Admonitions, to the number of six or seven. It makes three obstinacies, and three publick Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against a Man that is excommunicated. First he is admonished by a particular Eldership (and we would know whether those be not publick Admonitions, yea or no, such as the Apostle intendeth; which is done by a publick Court, to which we presume they will say, that all the People may come, and in that respect it is to be accounted publick, or if not; yet that, which is done by publick Persons, in a publick Judicature, is publick Admonition) Then before they bring him to the Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, they must judge and censure him as obstinate, and that by a Major vote, or he is not further to be brought (and we believe they will not censure him to be obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, unless he hath had one or two Admonitions, and that by them) there's the first obstinacy. Then he is brought before the Classical Presbytery, who are to Sentence him to be excommunicated (which we believe they will not do, unless they also
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:154381:65"/> also have by Admonitions, tryed whether he hath been obstinate and impenitent, or no, upon those means which they are to use also, which is Admonition) then he is brought before the Congregation, there he is Admonished again over and over. And is it for the good of the Man, or is it for the satisfaction of the People, that they may see him obstinate, that he hath so good Admonitions given him? It cannot be meerly for the satisfaction of his obstinacy, unless these Admonitions can be supposed fit to work upon him. And then again in the third place, he is to be judged obstinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all those, or else he is not to be excommunicated; for if he Repented after all these, they are to forbear. And we may add, that they must needs make a judging of as many Repentances for his Absolution; and the judging of his Repentance must be a personal experience. Thus they multiply publick proceedings, beyond the Rule, whereas the proportion of Christ's patience seems to be set.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How doth the dividing of things thus retard their proceedings, in case of open and manifest Scandals? How must needs so many removes rather harden the Man, than soften him, and in stead of being a means of doing him good, be a vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation to him? The pretence is, that hereby Scandal is avoided, if the party Repents; but the Truth is, this inlargeth it; for either the Scandal is a thing commonly known in the Congregation of the People, and then it is best to have it examined and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that before them presently, if it may be, either by his Repentance afore them, that they may be Witnesses thereof, or by his appearing innocent. If it be not known commonly and ordinarily abroad, it is more Scandal to have it brought to strangers, than to have it to be kept in his own Church: especially if that those, of all the Churches (who are interested in what the Elders of the Classical Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery do) or any of them may be present at pleasure.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Presbyterian way of Excommunication, causeth ordinances to be mispla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, a less effectual, after a more effectual; for those Admonitions by his own El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before the Congregation, being the last (according to order of Nature, in all Remedies, according to Christ's order and degrees of proceeding, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. and according to God's order in his dealing with us) must be supposed more powerfully effectual, than the first: And yet if the power of Sentencing the Man be in the Classical Presbytery, by vertue of which he is excommunicated; that must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be more effectual, to bring him to Repentance. And then also they let their Classical Admonitions be the last, before excommunication, whereas if those before the Congregation be acknowledged to be the more effectual, then where the more effectual Admonitions, according to the ordinance of Christ, are supposed to lie in order to excommunication, there the power of excommunication must be supposed to lie also.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A <hi>6th</hi> Distortion is, the deformity that is occasioned by putting an interest into those two sort of Churches, Congregational and Classical, in the point of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, and dividing the power between them; one for the Sentence, the other for the Execution. Which will appear from that interest the People have, comen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable with the power that the Elders are to have. We speak not now of joyning in the Sentence of Excommunication, and of suffrage in the Judgment, which will make a distinct argument, and is as strong as any of the rest, for power of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication to be proper and peculiar to a Congregational Church, and to prove that what ever other power Classical Presbyteries or Synods pretend to; yet of all other, they can claim no interest in this; because in them, there is wanting one sort or kind of Judges, into whose Hands God hath put the power. But suppose for the present, that the whole People have but an interest of presence only, at the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are to be given to the party afore excommunication, and at the act of excommunication it self; and give them but the lowest kind of consent that may be, a Tacit consent, when the act is to be done; yet allow them to be present, that thereby such a Tacit consent may be held forth, and that they may be edified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; and that by mourning, over the party, his Heart may be broken, and the more wrought upon; and their Consciences may be satisfied in the justness of his excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; because that they are to joyn in the execution of it, and not so much as to eat with him afterwards. Now this interest, both Presbyterian principles and Preachers, do give and allow unto the People of that particular Church, whereto he doth belong▪ Yea the Papists themselves, who do hold, that what is done, in the Congregation, is but the promulgation of the excommunication, already compleated
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:154381:66"/> in the Bishop's consistory; yet give so much to the people, to that particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, whereof he is a Member, that there should be a promulgation. See the <hi>Rhemist's</hi> notes on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. But Presbyterian principles do give more; for they will not excommunicate, if the People be against it; yea, a whole National Assembly, if they should determine it, would yet stop the execution, if the people be against it. And therefore we argued afore, from dividing Discipline it self, and from the Sentence of excommunication, being given to the Presbyterian Classes, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution unto the Elders in the Congregations, so we shall now argue from the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity or Distortion, that is between the power given to the Elders of those Churches, as one Church, compared with the interest of the people of these Churches, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as one Church also.</p>
                  <p>The interest, that these Classical Elders come to have together, with the Elders of the Congregation in the Sentence, must be, because that they are Elders of all those Congregations, as of one Church. For the strength of the argument, that is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Presbyterial Divines, for such a Classical Eldership, is, that many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations make one Church, whereof these Elders, in common, are the Representation; and when they pronounce the Sentence of excommunication, as Elders of all those Congregations, as one Church, which they are an Eldership unto; and by that one individual act of theirs, the Man is authoritatively and (so far as concerns the interest of Elders) in a special manner excommunicated out of all those Congregations, whereto they are an Eldership, as well as out of his own (so far as the Sentence goes) in such a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, as belongeth not to the next Churches of the Presbyteries about, but by vertue of that forementioned special relation. And this common Eldership, in this Sentence of theirs, must either have the relation of an Eldership, only to that particular Church, whereof this Man is a Member; so as that particular Church, and that common Eldership make up the adequate Relation of Church and Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in and for this their Act, or this Eldership hath a relation to all the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. If the first be asserted, then there would be so many several Relations of Elderships and Churches, as there are Churches, upon occasion. For this common Eldership, and this particular Church, would be one Church in this act for this time, and for this Man's excommunication; and they would be another Church at another time, in relation to another Man's excommunication, in another particular Church, which were observed. And if they act in this act, as a common Eldership to all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, as one Church; then the Sentence doth formally cast the Man (so far as the Sentence goes) out of all those Churches, as well as out of his own; and by one single intire individual act, they do as Elders to this Church, excommunicate him formally out of these Churches, and but virtually only, and consequently out of all other Churches, belonging to other Presbyteries, as out of the Universal it self. And so far as the power of the Sentence reacheth in this common classical Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he is afterward cast out executively in that particular Church, whereof he is more especially a Member, by the same way of Authority, by which he is cast out of that one Church, whereto he doth belong. For these classical Elders, being in their Vote a Church Representative, they Represent that Church, whereof the Man is a Member, as making one with all the rest of the Churches.</p>
                  <p>Now then, make these three things proportionable. 1. Make this interest of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all these Churches, in their kind and relation, proportionable to the interest of the Elders to all these Churches, in their kind and relation, these making one Church and they being but a common Eldership, because these are one Church. And 2. Make the interest of execution, but answerable to the interest of Sentence. Yea 3. Make the interest of the Elders of that particular Church, whereof the Person is a Member, but answerable to the interest of the People of that particular Church, whereof he is a Member; and there will appear so great a Distortion in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government, thus sharing with the Congregational, as will confute and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it; and such an uniform in the Congregational, as will establish it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the first, there is all the reason in the World, that if these classical El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders do lay the pretence to their common Power and Authority, because these Churches are one Church (and they are all one Church in respect of the People, as well as of all the Elders) if this be the Foundation of their Plea, if it ariseth from this Relation and Respect; then look what interest the Elders, as Elders, can pretend to, as one Church, being one Church Representative; that individual and like inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:154381:66"/> must the People, that are one Church, also lay claim to; for there is a dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, a great and a manifest Disproportion, in giving that to the Elders, as Elders of a Church, that is not given to the people, according to their proportion, as a Church. As then by these Elders, in common, the Sentence of Excommunication goes forth, and the Man is Admonished by them as Elders, to bring him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and this is a common act of that whole Eldership, making a Church to all these Churches; so the People must be present at these, or some other Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the person (and that both for their edification, and for to work Repentance in the party) that their Tacite consent, by presence, might be given; and that they (seeing they are to execute it) might be satisfied in his being cast out. If indeed the People had, as a Church, no interest at all, then we acknowledge this Argument would wholy fail; and these Elders must have the whole fall, and intire power to give Sentence, to Execute, to Admonish, and all were to be done there, in the classical Assembly, and no where else; but the whole business would be there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If it be said first, that the power of Sentencing, and so of the act of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, is performed in this common Presbytery, and that what is done in the particular Congregation, whereunto he belongeth, is but the promulgation of it?</p>
                  <p>Besides what was said against that before, this further here may be added; that the interest which the people have, is not meerly to have it promulged before them, but that they may be edified, and that they knowing the party, he having lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, may mourn over him; yea, and bewail that such a Scandal is fallen amongst them, whereby their Ordinances and Communion, was in danger of being Defiled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the Man hereby may be wrought upon; yea, and it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that the Man be brought afore that Church, where he is personally to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated. Now all this is more still, than bare promulgation of the Sentence; for that might be done, whether he were present or absent. Yet still, if there be an interest of promulgation, let it be in all the Churches; and all these Churches, as met in one common Church, as the Elders themselves are. Or if there be an interest of being edified by the Admonitions, let it be in all the Churches. But how can this be? If in each Congregation apart, how will your Admonitions be more multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that were multiplied enow afore? And if in common, how can they meet, as Presbyteries are cast? Or when did they ever?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If secondly it be said, that it is promulged in that fixed Church, whereto he doth belong, in regard they have a special primary interest; because usually he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the Sacrament there; we shall speak to that under the third particular, by and by. Only for the present, consider that if the interest of People and Elders be made up proportionably, so as that Church hath a primary interest in the Person, because he hath a fixed Communion in the Sacrament with them, which, if he there partake, would be ordinarily defiled; and other Churches have but a secondary and remote interest, as the <hi>Genus</hi> hath to the <hi>individum,</hi> whereas this particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, is as the <hi>Species</hi> to this <hi>individum:</hi> Then let the Elders of the classical Presbytery, (be to make things commensurable) acknowledging to have a remote and secondary interest also in their power, to sentence him; and so let him come to them, but at second hand. Or to make the comensurableness yet nearer, as in the matter of promulgation, the People of all the other Churches, have but a promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation at second hand, by hearsay; and have no interest of presence at all; so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably let these Elders of other Churches, have but the like share in that power, and the controversie is at an end; for then as it is not at all promulged in other Churches, so the Man would not be at all sentenced in the Classical Presbyteries. But if they challenge the primary interest, and that the power, by which he is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, belongeth unto them; then let the People of all those Churches, be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have the like primary interest of promulgation also; because that they are the greater number in comparison of the Church, whereof he is a Member; that being but a part, the other the whole; and therefore the Congregation must have the lesser principal interest therein.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And Secondly, If that the act of excommunication, that is done in his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, is the formal act of excommunication, by which actually he standeth excommunicated, and delivered up to Satan, and not until then; let but this act
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:154381:67"/> of execution, be but commensurable to the sentence; and then as the sentence was denounced by those classical Elders, as making Elders to all those Congregations, as one Church, so also should the execution be; and so the Man must be actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, over and over, as often as there are many particular Churches, to that Presbytery.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And thirdly; If the interest of the Elders of that Church, make an Eldership to that Congregation, and be made commensurable with the interest of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, the one as Elders, the other as People; Then first, as this Church hath the primary and the fixed interest, and such a peculiar interest, as all the Churches about him have not, <hi>viz.</hi> An interest of Communion, suitable to his casting out; as he had a fixt Communion with them, it is therefore a fixt casting out, which is properly the act of excommunication; and for these Reasons, their consent is so required, as of none of all the Churches about, and their satisfaction to be sought, so as of none of all the Churches about. Now then answerably, let the Eldership of this particular Church, have but a like power of an Eldership in their Relation to them, as a Church; and then the People's interest being consent, where consent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is required; and the Elders interest being Authority, and the sentence, it will follow, that, as the liberty of consenting is only in this Congregation, so that the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sentencing should only be in these Elders. And as other Churches do but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their offence, if things have not been rightly Administred, so the Elders of other Churches should do no more. At leastwise as the consent of this people is actually required, which is not of all the other Churches, and as without which, because of their interest, the classical Congregation will forbear the execution of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; yea, a whole National Assembly will: So then let the Elders of this Congregation, when they meet in this classical Presbytery, have but the like priviledge; that if they do dissent, and think the Man is not to be sentenced, or be excommunicated, the whole classical Presbytery, should not have power to proceed to sentence. For will not you give as much to the Elders in Government, as El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that Church, as to the people? Will you prefer the interest of the people, which is otherwise laid so low, before the interest of the Elders, that are over them in the Lord? And if that the Elders of that Church should have this Prerogative, in the classical Presbytery, the power thereof would soon come to nothing, without disputing against it. And in this case, these classical Elders are not a Presbytery in common, but the Pastor, or Eldership of the particular Congregation, would have some kind of Episcopal power in this Presbytery, having a Negative among them. Or suppose that the Elders of his own Congregation deny to promulge the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and actually to excommunicate the Man, will you not give them the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial interest of Elders, in the execution of the sentence of excommunication, as the Elders in common had in the sentence? Or will you send other Elders to do it? If so, then they in that act are an Eldership to them only.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The eighth, ninth and tenth Argument, to prove a Congregational Church, to be the due subject of Ecclesiastical Power; because Admonitions are to be given, and Excommunication to be Administred in the presence of such a Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> 8. IF further, the presence of the people in the Church, is to be the Seat of all Authoritative Admonitions, that go before the sentence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication made by the Elders, to them that are accused of publick sin and scandal, for their edification, and if the act of excommunication is to be (as was granted) afore them; then the Seat of the power of excommunication is not in classical Elders, by Christ's Ordination, but in Elders that are Elders of a particular Congregation. The Reason of the consequence is clear, because the party is to be sentenced to be excommunicated, upon his being judged obstinate; and he is to be judged obstinate after Admonitions: That therefore, which is the Seat or Place in which these Admonitions are to be given, is also to be the Seat of the Judgment
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:154381:67"/> of his obstinacy, and of the sentence thereupon. It were strange, that the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions and other proceedings, that make way, should be publick, and the Judgment and Sentence should be private. It is so in no publick Courts. And if the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregation be the Seat of the Antecedent Acts, the Admonitions, and of the consequent Act, the Act of excommunication it self; it were as strange, that only that immediate Act of the sentence, should be privately done by the classical El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and not afore the people. Besides, that the classical Elders are not to sentence, is evident by this; because those that have the power to Admonish, surely they must have the power to Sentence: And therefore if the classical Elders cannot, nor do not come to perform the acts of Admonition before the people; then they cannot be those that, according to the Scriptures, have interest in the sentence as Elders. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they be that Church which our Saviour Christ speaks of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. because that the Admonitions of that Church, are expressed, as liable to be neglected, and therefore they must be supposed present at the Admonitions. And as the Apostle too commends it as an ordinance, that the Admonition should be before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. So classical Elders cannot be present.</p>
                  <p>Now to prove, that particular Congregations, are the Seat of publick Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is that place in, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. which gives evidence, <hi>Them that sin</hi> (saith he) <hi>Rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</hi> It is evident here, that he doth give a direction to <hi>Timothy,</hi> concerning Church proceedings, and keeping of a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Court; and therefore in the verse before, gives directions about receiving an Accusation, and how that Accusation must be proved, by two or three Witnesses; and he speaks of all such publick Admonitions or Rebukes, as are to follow upon the receit of the Accusation, when it is made evident by Witnesses; and of such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions likewise, as are in order to excommunication, and for such sins as will deserve excommunication, if Men be obstinate (for if for any other sins, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly for those) and it is of sins, in case of publick scandal, which are the subject of excommunication; therefore he saith, <hi>Them that sin, Rebuke afore all,</hi> then when a Man's sin is publick, and comes to be taken notice of afore all. Now he speaks to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that was an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and under him to all Church-Officers, to the end of the World, when <hi>Evangelists</hi> (who were extraordinary Ministers) should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: And as other directions, that are given to him, do concern the Eldership of Congregations in after Ages, so also this, to teach them how to behave themselves in the House of God. Now with the same breath that he doth give them power and warrant to Rebuke, when accusations are brought orderly to them, he withal directs (and his directions fall chiefly thereon) where these Rebukes should be, not privately, but afore all, and what all? Not afore all that are their Elders only, for they are to rebuke them afore all, that all may fear, surely therefore it is intended for the benefit, not only of the Elders, but of all the people.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that this place is to be understood, but as that of the Old Law, when a Malefactor was to be put to Death, it was, that all might hear and fear; and so these admonitions may be given privately in the Consistory, and yet all may hear of it, and fear: The answer is, that there is this difference between executing of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral punishment, and giving of spiritual admonitions; that the Terror of spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, doth not lie in the hearsay, but it works by the people's personal hearing of it; and it is ordained so to do. The power of that ordinance (as of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) lies in personal hearing, and as Faith cometh by hearing, so this fear must come by hearing also; otherwise it were all one, as to say, such a Man Preached a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Sermon, that all might be comforted; or he Preached the Law, that all might be Terrified; and yet should mean, that all those, that were at the Sermon, should have comfort in it, or be Terrified by it. Therefore as those, that are wrought upon to fear, must be wrought upon by the admonitions, so it must be by being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally present, and hearing of them.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that it is, in a classical Assembly, done in a place so publick, and in a Court so open, where all may come if they please: We reply, that the Apostle doth not only say, that it should be done in a place where all do come; but he lays it as a Duty upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> to do it in a place where all may come; for otherwise, one of the great ends of admonition is lost, he bids him Rebuke them, that fin, afore all. <hi>That all may fear.</hi> If therefore our Presbyterian Brethren will attain the end of their admonitions (that all may fear) it; must be done where all do use to meet;
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:154381:68"/> and if so, then either their classical Elders must come and meet in the particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, or the particular Congregations must come to them, and so all the company of people of the classical Church must meet, Women, as well as Men; for they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of that particular part of edification, of fearing, and why should they be excluded the benefit of it? And whether the proceedings to excommunication according to our way, which is for the party to have his own Elders, before his own people, judicially to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the fact, and to give publick Admonitions, edged with all sorts of Scripture, to bring him to Repentance; and if he remain obstinate in the view of all, then for him to be excommunicated; or if he Repents, to have that Repentance appear upon the place afore all (which all suit best, and fall in with the Congregational way) whether that this doth not agree more with right Reason, and all the ends than can be supposed of Examination, Admonitions, and Excommunication, either to work upon the party, or to work upon others, or for the fairness and equity of the proceedings, rather than the way of the Classical Presbytery, let any Rational Man Judge.</p>
                  <p>For what hath been said of examination and admonition, and the ends of them, or any other end that the Scripture holds forth therein (that go before, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany excommunication) they are better attained in this Congregational Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than in the other.</p>
                  <p>As 1. For the examination of the person, that the evidence of the fact, in a judiciary way, should be before his own People, and by his own Elders, is every way most equal; because that they are to joyn in the casting of him out, and in the execution of the sentence afterwards, and are therefore to be satisfied of the justness of his being cast out: And there is that proper Communion, they have held with him, <hi>viz.</hi> a fixed Communion, which no Church else on Earth can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to. And if the Pcople must be satisfied at any time, if after the Sentence by hearsay, and by relation (as the Presbyterians themselves acknowledge) it will much more satisfie them before, when they hear the Person himself examined, and all that he can say. And if that be true of <hi>Cyprian, Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus tractari debet,</hi> that which concerns all, the whole common, it should be handled and transacted by all; and if that were not true, yet surely this, that what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all, should be handled afore all.</p>
                  <p>The like 2. Holds for those publick Admonitions, that are to be given, wherein also the people have an interest, that they may be edified thereby, as well as by Preaching; for what is Discipline or publick Admonitions, but a publick Application of the Truths of the Word of God, to the Conscience of a scandalous sinner, to warn others, and to bring him unto Repentance? So as indeed acts of Discipline, Admonitions, are the most pastoral Sermon; and so are a part of the Worship of God, which therefore the people of his own Church, must have a peculiar interest in, as they have in other Sermons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be looked at, that the Man is to be shamed, as a means to bring him to Repentance, as in 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 14. To have all these Examinations and Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to have all Transacted, that concerns a scandalous sin, before the whole Church, tendeth more to this. Neither can he be thought obstinate, until such time as he hath this means (which we see God hath Sanctified) in a Spiritual way apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. In a word, for the whole, we say, as <hi>Bains</hi> long since said (and it hath a reason in it, therefore we quote it) <hi>That when censure it the most sharp Spiritual Medicine, it were ill with our Church, if he (speaking of their Pastor) who is Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent always amongst them, as the Spiritual Physician should not have the power of Administring it.</hi> That which he saith of the Pastor, to whom he gives the chief stroke in it, we say of all the Elders of a Congregation, that are continually a Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with it.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that afore he is put to this publick shame, before the Congregation, he should be Authoritatively Admonished by the Eldership, to see first how that would work: We Reply,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That either his sin is notoriously known to the whole Congregation already; <hi>Res famosa,</hi> as was the case of the Incestuous <hi>Corinthian;</hi> and then it is fit it should be brought instantly to the Congregation, that he may be shamed. Neither is it to any end, that the Elders should deal in the case privately with him; but as the Scandal is publick, the Admonition should be publick also, even from the first. Or suppose his sin be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:154381:68"/> more private, then, if the private means, which Christ hath appointed, hath not been used by those that bring the Accusation, as telling it first to himself, and exhorting him to Repentance; and if that could not gain him, then taking two or three, or more, who also have dealt with him, and yet could not bring him to Repentance; in this case also the Elders are not to meddle in it, before the Church, till such time as those means have been used, for no man's sin is to be brought to them, till he hath past thorough those ways and means, which Christ hath appointed; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, then indeed the Elders may Admonish him, having thus the cognizance of it; but yet therein, they are not to deal as an Eldership, in a judiciary way; but as those two or three Brethren, who are to be called to Admonish him, should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Though even such Admonitions from Elders, would perhaps have more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in respect of their Relation, than those of private Brethren. But in case that a Man hath past through all these means, and still is obstinate and impenitent, and hath stood out Christ's proceedings; now it is the Man's own fault, that his sin should thus be brought to light, and now nothing will cure him, but the shame of it, by publick Admonitions before all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. If (for the tenderness of his shame) he is first to be dealt withal by the Elders, before he be brought to the Congregation; yet not by the classical Elders, who are strangers to him. Who if they keep an open Court, as they ought to do (as all other Courts are) whither any one may come; then if not, the shame of his sin, yet the Dishonour of it will be greater this way, than the other; whilst it is kept within the compass of his own Church, and of these who are his Brethren, and have known his Converse, and have known also his Graces. And that shame, he shall have thus before Strangers, will be a means to harden him, whereas the shame, that he shall have before his own People, will work more kindly, and be a means to melt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. The presence of his own People, in all these proceedings, when he is thus convicted of the Sin, when he is thus Admonished, and upon obstinacy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be excommunicated, serveth to a further double end, both as it respects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (so as no Church else, nor no Elders else whatsoever) and as it respects the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son also, and his good. For it respects the Congregation themselves, both by vertue of that special Relation to, and Communion they have with him, as one Body to Christ; and therefore they are to Sympathize with him, to be humbled together with him, for his sin, to bemoan and bewail him, and themselves; that such a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, even as to them, should befall them, by such a sin falling out amongst them. <hi>You are puffed up,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>you have not Mourned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. That Law is to take hold on them, in respect of this proper near relation, which <hi>Paul</hi> giveth, 1 Cor. 12. 26. <hi>If one Member suffer all the Members suffer with it, or if one Member be Honoured, all the Members rejoyce with it; Now ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in particular;</hi> that is, the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> being a particular Body, have a more special Relation one unto another, more than to any other Churches. And this mourning and the like, it is to shew themselves clear of that matter, which otherwise would be a sin of that Body; and as, in all other Relations, Members of a Nation, mourn for the sins of a Nation, Members of a Family, for the sins of a Family; so especially in this nearest special Relation of all other, each Member is to mourn, and sorrow for the sins of a Member, as if it were the whole's; because a Dishonour is thereby reflected also upon the whole, and an anger of God expressed against the whole; for even Church sins make God to be angry with particular Persons. As for that sin about the Sacrament, in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. particular Persons were visited, <hi>for this cause, some are weak and sick,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>Judge your selves, that you be not Judged.</hi> It is therefore necessary, when a Man's sin is ripe for publick Admonitions, that his own People should know it; and therefore that all these Admonitions should be afore his own, that the height and aggravation of the sin thus set open before his Conscience, to make him Repent, should be set open also before theirs, for all those ends afore mentioned. And to think that the Elders of a Classical Church, should Representatively mourn for all the rest, or that, whereas the cause of mourning is neerness of Relation, that they should mourn as his own would do, cannot be supposed. And then 2. If it res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects working upon the Man, if that be the end of this bewailing, and of this mourning, to break his Heart, to have his own Congregation thus mourning, who
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:154381:69"/> have thus known him, and with whom he hath communicated, and to see their Hearts broken for his sin, when they have not sinned, only are of the same Body with him; this must needs be an ordinance much more effectual to work upon him, than if he were brought afore all the National Councils in the World, who are taught with his sin but remotely, as the Body of a National Church must needs be very remote to a provincial Church, and this also remote in its proportion to a Classical.</p>
                  <p>Now we find that the proceedings thus, to excommunication, are expressed to us by the very Phrase, <hi>bewailing, I am afraid,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that when I come, I shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail</hi> some of you; that is, I shall be inforced as to Admonish you, so to proceed further; and so in 1 Cor. 5. 2. <hi>You have not Mourned, that, he that hath done this Deed, may be taken from among you.</hi> To bring him before National and Classical Assemblies, and the like, may work in a civil way more upon him; but, in a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way, this is a means much more suited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> for the act of excommunication it self, that then the People should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, we need not contend for; because it is granted. And assuredly, if that they are to be present, that they may mourn and wail, when any is thus cast out, their presence is much more required afore, because their wailing and bemoaning of him then, might have been a means to prevent what befalls him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> 9. But if besides all these interests it be found, that the People of his own Congregation, have a joynt interest to judge; and that by way of Suffrage, and concur in the Sentence with the Elders, in the throwing of him out: Or have such an interest with Judgment, and cutting off a Member, that a Jury have, joyned with the Bench of Justices and Judges, and that they are to judge of the Fact, and of his obstinacy, and the like; why then, it will clearly follow, that the power of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication must be in every Congregation of People and Elders: And thus to have the Man judged, both by the one, and the other, is the fairest Law in the World. And we account it even the glory of one Nation, that no Man's life is subjected to the judgment of all the Judges of the Kingdom, but that he must be Tryed by his Peers, <hi>per pares.</hi> That we shall speak when we come to that Head, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are to have a concurring interest with the Elders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> 10. If no Elders are to set up a consistory for ordinary Government, but in the presence, and before the Church; then the power of all acts of Government must lie within the Body of a Congregational Church. Because there are no other ordinary constant Church meetings of the Body of the People, but only by Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; for all such Meetings are to be of as many, as can meet in one place; and all are interested in it for the present, one, as well as another.</p>

                     <p>The eleventh and twelfth Arguments, proving single Congregations inabled to exert all Acts of Church-power. That such Churches there were in the first Ages of Christianity. That the Apostles planted such Churches, that had the intire power within themselves.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> 11. THere were in the first Ages of Christianity, Bishops in Churches and Villages. And in the sense of the Ages, in which this was, it was all one as to have an intire Government in a Church, in a Village; for the intire Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was in the Hands of their Bishops, in those times, such a Government as is now claimed by the Presbytery. Therefore from the practice of the primitive times, it is evident that one single Congregation, with its Elders, is a compleat Seat of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as well as Worship.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Argu.</hi> 12. The Churches in the first planting of them by the Apostles, were in all places Congregational Churches. Those, in smaller Cities, may well be supposed to have been always such. Those in the great Cities, were at first such: Of <hi>Philippi</hi> it is said, that in the beginning of the Gospel, it was a Church, and it was so called, <hi>Ph.</hi> 1. 4, 15. and it was a Church that had Bishops and Deacons, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 1. who Communicated to <hi>Paul,</hi> by way of giving and receiving. In a manner, all sides have acknowledged this, even the Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:154381:69"/>
                     <hi>Hierusalem</hi> it self at first, was but one Congregation; and other greater Cities also, were no more; for can we imagine that the Apostles should stay forming up Churches, till such time as they should multiply to so many, as to make many Congregations under classical Churches? So this is not supposable, because that the Apostles were to go over the World, and could not every where stay so long; they therefore staid, till there were a sufficient number to make up a Church, and Elders over them. And to be sure, the first Church of all, had a sufficient Eldership, for they had the eleven A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. And for them all to be Officers, to so small a number at the first, is infinitely less disproportionable to them, than for our Great Lord and Master to serve and minister (as himself was pleased at his last Supper, to Term it) the Sacrament of Bread and Wine, unto Eleven Apostles; and then to Preach a long Sermon unto these Eleven, whom he had taken care of. And at the first, when they were so few, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in prayer together, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. it is to be supposed, they had the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and so were a Church, seeing they had received it with our Lord and Saviour, with commission for him to do the like. And this Congregational Church at first, having these Apostles over them, who (as our Brethren say) acted the part of ordinary Elders, must needs be supposed to be as sufficient for a Presbytery, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards their acts can be supposed to be, when they multiplyed to more Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as our Brethren affirm) And if we could give no instance of any act of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they did; yet it is certain, that the same power with which they did acts of Government, afterward as such a Presbytery, they had then at first; for they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but out of that power afterward, which they had afore. And so in all those other Churches, when they were single Congregations, having Elders set over them, the like must be supposed. And when there was thus Congregational Churches, having Elders over them, they had the right, and they had the power to exercise all acts of Government within themselves, or else when the Apostles left them, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to the grace of God, having set Elders over them; they had not been left to a sufficient means, to take away offences, and to purge out scandals, and to keep the Worship pure, and to preserve themselves for Succession.</p>
                  <p>And if they had this Right and Power, they must have it by vertue of that Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. Here then, <hi>de facto,</hi> Congregational Churches were invested with a compleat power. And so according to that Maxim, <hi>primum, in quolibet genere, est Mensura reliquorum, the first in every kind, is the measure of the rest</hi> we have to plead, that the first Churches in existence with that power we contend for, were such Congregational Churches which we assert.</p>
                  <p>We further add, that suppose that these Churches came to be multiplyed, or to have Neighbour Churches near them, what became of that Power and Right, which as Congregations having Elders in them, and as a Church to Christ, they were invested with? How should this power come to be taken away, or they come to loose it, and be Transferred unto an Associated Presbytery, of many Congregations? If upon this Association, there had been a new power, yet the old former power must be supposed to stand still intire, or else they loose it (as the Cities in <hi>Germany,</hi> before they were united into that Emperial Body, had intire priviledges within themselves; and that, they retain still notwithstanding their Union, only their Association was for Appeals, and cases of common concernment) and as the multiplication was accidental, so a new accidental power might come over them, which they had not afore, if they should miscarry in that they had afore; therefore that power, that was first in them, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be taken from them. It is true indeed, before their multiplication this must be said, they were Independent Churches, in that gross sense, which is imposed upon us; that is, they were accountable unto none; why? Because there were none near them, to be accountable unto. But that was not a priviledge Essential, but Accidental, not positive, but because there was no other near existent. And yet not so neither; for if there were any in the World, they should have Appealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. And suppose a Congregational Church, alone by it self, can be supposed to have an accidental Independency private (which in this respect, is a Negative pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, rather than a positive) yet still that positive power, which they were intirely invested withal within themselves, for positive acts of Government, that was not invested on them, because there were no other Churches; but because they were a Church of themselves. And this power, if once they had it, is not, by Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Churches, to be taken away from them; the Multiplication is but acci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dental,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:154381:70"/> but the Form, they were cast into at first, is the essential Form that consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted them a Church, and a politick Body. </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When these Churches were multiplied, and (as our Brethren would have it) continued many Congregations, under one Presbytery, of the Elders of each of these Churches thus multiplied: Either that first Church and their Elders (which still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main fixed Elders unto them) have all the power and priviledge they had afore, or not, in this New Government to come upon their multiplication and association: If they have the same power and priviledge, then this proposition standeth good; only the question then will be, what power over them (their own remaining thus intire) in a way of dependency any other Church can have, which we must after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards speak to. If upon this association, this particular Congregation have not the power it had afore intire within it self, then the Form of the Government first constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is clean altered, and clearly a New Form of Government is set up; and that both in respect of the Right of the People, and the Right of the Elders in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. If the People had any interest of presence or of suffrage (which we contend for) at the Sentence of Excommunication, and the Examination of things; by vertue of this new Association, that interest is taken from them; and removed up into the Classical meetings of the Elders, and into a Government that is meerly Aristocratical. And look as in a Government consisting both of People and Rulers, and the interest of both, or including in it priviledges that the one hath, as well as the other, (though the one in a lower degree) if the one becomes meerly Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, we count that Government changed, and it will be a new Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so it would be here. Nor <hi>2dly,</hi> Is it true, that because the Government (as our Brethren affirm) is in the Rulers only; therefore it may be inlarged, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst to other Rulers of other Congregations, taken in with them; and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple not wronged of their Right. For first, if the Charter of a People, of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration or Body should be, that they should be Ruled by their own Elders (whom themselves chose, as a Corporation) by their own Mayor, Recorder, and Aldermen, yet it were a new Form of Government, for them to come under two or three May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, Recorders, and Aldermen, of other Incorporate Towns, and they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it so; And 2. The Rulers would think so too; As if there were a Family, the Master whereof had intire Government within it self; and there were Families in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creast, and they all joyned in a Combination, to Rule all those Families in common, and that in such things, wherein before he Ruled alone; surely this would be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a new Form of Government; how else doth Oeconomicks differ from Politicks? Would not Colledges think so, though Associated into an University? If the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges should have those priviledges of choosing Master-Fellows, Scollars, of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, of Expelling, invested into other Hands, if all the Jurisdiction which they had when alone, or if any great part of it, should be exercised in common for them, when other Colledges are built; because they become an University, they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this a Dispriviledging of them. So it would be here in this case of Churches.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Some Exceptions made against the last Argument, as not Conclusive removed, how we are to consider the Churches, as at first planted by the Apostles as pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, and Examples to us.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>TO this Argument, there are many Exceptions, which I shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is excepted, That the first Churches, though but single Congregations, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Elders in them, which did or might exercise all Church-Acts, cannot yet be drawn into an ordinary pattern; because the first must, out of a necessity, do that which afterwards when multiplied single Congregations, that can Associate, may not do. Even as though <hi>Cain</hi> at first Marryed his Sister, yet that is no Warrant for us, now to do the like, when Men and Women are multiplied; so neither can the Instance of the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or any other first Churches, be the pattern to Warrant single Churches now multiplyed, to do that which they then did.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:154381:70"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Apostles did not stay in places, till there were a sufficiency to set up a Church, but if that a Presbyterian Government, over many Congregations, had been the Rule of Christ; and that they must of necessity have been set up; they would have rather staid, or sent an Evangelist to Convert so many, as to make up a sufficient Presbytery for a classical Church. If <hi>Adam</hi> could, with his Breath, have made Men and Women, though he had staid a while, <hi>Cain</hi> should not have Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Sister. And therefore, if that, by the Ordination of Christ, a Presbyterial Church were the first Church; God would have staid, and the Apostles would have staid, as God staid giving the Ark, and the Tabernacle, and the Law of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a National Church, till such time as the <hi>Jews</hi> became so many, as to rise to a Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It lies upon those, that affirm it, to prove that the endowing single Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations at first with an intire power, was an act of necessity, and not voluntary, and as it should stand in all Ages. Had a Presbyterian Church Government been accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Christ's Institution, the Apostles would have Taught Christians to remove out of the places, where they could not make up Presbyterian Churches, and to go into Cities, where they might make them, that so Churches might be set up in their fulness at first.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. The power of a single Congregation, to have acted as a Presbytery at the first, was not grounded on a case of necessity (because there were no other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es existing, to associate with, and so was accidental to them) but this one alone Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, was essentially and innately and intirely compleat in it self, and within it self, as much as when afterward there were many. To say the power of Eleven Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as combined, was defective; because but over one Congregation, and but out of an extraordinary necessity, would be the greatest Derogation in the World. And if there could be a supposition, that there had been other Churches existing, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> this Presbytery of the first Church had not been bound to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociate, as not having sufficient power within it self. To affirm these things of this first Presbytery of the Eleven Apostles (as our Brethren suppose it, and it is the main foundation of their case) to have been defective, and their power (now because over one Congregation) to have been founded on an extraordinary necessity only, as for <hi>Cain</hi> to Marry his Sister, in a way below the Warrant, as of the ordinary Rule: Thus first to cast them (in this Example) into the condition of ordinary Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, to make it an argument for the Presbytery; and then to cast their power at first, below the power of an ordinary Classis, and to make it then to be dependent on a providential necessity; how Derogatory is it to that Transcendent power of such Officers? So then, if they are to be lookt upon, at all, as the pattern of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Presbytery; then as such now, when over but one Congregation, as much as if they had been over many. For to say, they were but as extraordinary Persons, when over but one Congregation; and afterwards an ordinary Colledge of Presbyters, when many, is too incoherent, and inconsistent with it self, to be affirmed. And then what is the reason that this first existence of an Eldership over one Congregation, should not be as ordinary a pattern to Warrant, as full and sufficient a Presbytery in one Congregation, as it is for the supposed Presbyterial Government over many? So that if it were ordinary, it serves as much for us, as them, and indeed for us first; because that this, as one Congregation, existed first; and they were as much an ordinary Presbytery at first, as at last, and endowed with the same sufficiency of inherent power. And if it were extraordinary, the instance will not serve them at all, first nor last, for a ground of Presbyterial Government. And surely if this Church at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> had so many Teachers besides Apostles, as is pretended, when these Congregations came to be Multiplied (as is supposed) and divided, here was (if ever) enough to have made several sufficient Presbyteries, to these several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; and the Association of many Congregations into one can have place but in case of Defect, not of Sufficiency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is excepted, that we are not to consider Churches, as they were when the Apostles first began, but as they were, when the Apostles left them; and that <hi>Ordo intendentis</hi> is one thing, and <hi>Ordo generantis</hi> is another. Thus Nature first makes but a Child, which afterward grows up to a Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. As to the first, we argue the Example of those Churches, which the Apostles left, and, when they left them, commended them to the Grace of God, as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:154381:71"/> in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. when they had chosen them Elders, as having sufficient means to support themselves. And (as <hi>Bains</hi> argues against Bishops, and their Government over Churches) those whom the Apostles placed as chief, in the first constituting of Churches, and left as their Successours in their last farewell, which they gave to the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bain</hi>'s <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Tryal, pag.</hi> 65.</note> Churches; they had not, nor were to have any Superiour unto them in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as is evident in the instance of <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20. 28. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. So say we, that those whom the Apostles left, having placed Elders over them, and left as their Successours at their last farewell, commending them to the Grace of God, and so constituted, without mentioning of Association for Government, with other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; they, by Apostolical Warrant, were not to enter into such Associations, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Government and Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. As to that other part of the Exception, we reply, that certainly those Churches that the Apostles did thus leave, and the power in them, and the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thereof, to do all Church-acts as a Presbytery now at first, were as perfect Churches the first Day (as <hi>Adam</hi> was a perfect Man, when first Created) as afterwards they could be supposed to be. If Nature at first do beget a perfect Child, with all the parts, it may indeed grow in Stature; but all the Natural parts it hath when a Man, it hath when a Child; and though it may grow in Stature, it doth not grow in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor is defective of any of its Natural powers, when a Child; but all exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise their Natural Functions, when a Child, as truly as when a Man. And beside, joyn a Thousand Children together, they will not make one Man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is expected, that although no Churches may give away their Right, yet they may joyn with them, that will Corroborate their Right: So if the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that had a Presbytery afore, be multiplyed into another Congregation, it retains the same Presbytery, and is one Church still.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Either it is at their liberty to Retain their proper Presbytery, proper to themselves; and the other Congregation goes from them to have anew, or not. If it be at liberty, then Jesus Christ hath Instituted two Forms of Government, made two several Seats or Subjects of intire Church-power, for Men Arbitrarily to cast themselves into, which they please. This is to make two ordinary Patterns, of two sorts of Church-Government, one of a single Congregation, the other of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial over many; and to Warrant the sufficiency and compleatness of either, when either of them have a sufficient Presbytery. But that Christ should leave the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church so indefinite, cannot be imagined; not only because it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that one of them should not be better than the other, but (also as hath been said before) in respect to the Congregations themselves; because the one makes a vast difference from the other, in the point of fixedness and unfixedness of Officers; and further, because one would destroy the other. For allow but this Principle, that all Congregations that may have a sufficient Presbytery, may retain the Right and whole Government within themselves, as the first Subjects of it, as agreeing with the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and what Church will subject it self to the Presbyterial Government? And that this is not indifferent to all our Judgments, the Contentions on all hands do Testifie. If it be Arbitrary, then it would have been unlawful for any Congregation in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Times, to have Retained the Right that was first setled upon them; and to have in exercise all power within themselves as whole, as when Churches did multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. If it be given as a liberty by Christ; voluntary Subjection is not to take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and that Form of Government, which it doth give up its right to, being a new change of Government (as was said afore) there must be as much an Institution for it, as there was for that Right it had afore. It is impossible there should be two Rights to the same thing, whereof the one is incompatible with the other; for if the Congregations can claim it as its Rights, then the Presbytery cannot; for that both should exercise it, is impossible. There may be differing interests of power, in the same politick Body, but that one and the same, while power should be in one, and also in a greater, and in another, cannot be imagined.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. To the second part of the Exception, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is a strengthening of the power of Congregations, and not a taking of it away, it being an intrinsecal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, We Reply. 1. That of all other Answers, we wonder at that; for if a Master of a Family, that Ruled as a Master afore, should have his power, in governing of his Family, committed into the Hands of other Masters of Families, together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; would he account this a strengthening of his power, as he is a Master of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:154381:71"/> or a loosing of it? Masters of Colledges would judge it a taking away of their power, not a strong thing of it, for by this they lost it as Masters. And 2. If that all these do Rule in common, and so the Major Vote of them, in common, carries it, multitude of cases will fall out (whereto tho' he gives a Negative) that shall be carryed by the Major Vote, so as he utterly looseth his power, it being thus swallowed up by the greater number, how is this a strengthening of it then? And in this case, is it not an extrinsecal power to that Congregation, which▪ over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules it, as well as in the case of Bishops; when as the Votes of their own Officers that are proper to them, and fixed to them, whom they have chosen to watch over them, shall not carry matters that belong unto them, as afore they did. 3. The strengthening of Churche's power, lies in countenancing of what Churches have done, after they have done it, out of an Honour to them, and not lightly to hear Appeals from them; but it is not confirmed, by taking the power out of their Hands, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their acts for them Thus Kingdoms, in a League, strengthen each other's acts, when as they do not <hi>Foster Traytors,</hi> against each other; but if they should mingle powers in common, this were to destroy their power and right, as they be poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Bodies.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, it makes Churches equal still: It is granted that it's true, it makes Churches in a like condition indeed; but how? Not in the priviledges of Churches, it makes them in like condition of Subjection, but not of freedom, as they are Churches, or incorporate Bodies to judge within themselves. As if Incorporate Towns should have their priviledge of Life and Death, within themselves, given up to a Combination of many Incorporate Towns together, they were <hi>pares</hi> indeed, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peers,</hi> and here is an equality they are brought unto in this condition, but what equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there were in it, we see not.</p>
                  <p>That I may conclude, if, when Congregations were thus multiplied, a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation that before had the Government intire in it self, being invested with it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan anew to Associate with others for Government: Either the Classical Elders Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, have taken up the whole Government and Jurisdiction, and left to that Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and Elders, which once were invested with it, no part of it (which once they had proper to them afore) but as this exercised in common; or else there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and a dividing of that power, and acts of Government they had afore. If all be taken away, let that be affirmed and practised, and a Warrant for it shewed, let the classical Presbytery choose, and ordain their Deacons, let them Suspend from the Sacrament, let them only Admonish, let them admit their Members, let them choose their Elders, let them do all. If they part it, either it must be Arbitrarily, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves please, (we will retain this, and you shall have that) and if so, then they Arbitrarily part with that which was once given them by Jesus Christ; or else they part with all by a Rule, and a Command from God, putting the bounds between what the one shall have, and what the other shall have; let these bounds then be shewn, or any instances, in the Primitive Churches, be assigned of such alterations when Churches were multiplied, which in this case is necessary. This will breed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a great alteration and change, in the constitution of these Congregations them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their Relations to their Officers, as is obvious to any one who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I shall now Resolve some Queries that may be put, and in answering them, shall farther clear up my Assertion, which I have Demonstrated by so many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Suppose a Church have but one Elder? Yea, suppose it have no Elders at all? What is become of its power then?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Yet that Church whereof there is but one Elder, being the Seat of this Government, it is in this Politick Body, as in the Natural Body. A Man (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Nature) hath two Hands; but if one be cut off, or that he wants one, then he useth that one Hand, for which both were used afore. In this case, <hi>Vis recurret in proximum membrum, The intire Vigour, will return into the next Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> And this is properly a case of necessity, and not that other case which our Brethren would have, that one Congregation being alone, should therefore have the Government within it self of necessity, which it must part withall, according to the ordinary Rule, when more Congregations are multiplied.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The power of Government, being the Right of that Church, and not of other Churches over it; they are to choose more Officers, and they have a right so to do; and so thereby to preserve the right within themselves, rather than to borrow an Eye or a Hand from other Churches. We may say in this case, as our Brethren have said in the case of not separating from a Church rightly constituted, tho' it want an Officer or Officers. They say, that none ought in that case to separate, but it is to be required, that Officers be chosen and supplied, so say we in this case. It is in this case, as it is in that of small Corporations, which although they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed, yet they are Corporations still; and they do not loose their priviledges, and they do not therefore come under other Corporations to Govern them; but they are enabled themselves, to choose who they are that shall Govern them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. Their having, or not having Officers, doth not take away their Right; but only it takes away the exercise, untill such time as they have Officers. And their not having Officers, it doth not put the right into other Congregations, and the Elders thereof. The Right, in Elders, doth not lie in their being Elders, but in having a relation unto this Congregation, and in being their Elders.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. Suppose when a Congregation doth want a sufficiency of Officers, and so it be disinabled to act according to its Right; yet its case is but as the case of a Ward, who, though he is not able to manage his own Estate, yet this doth not put him by his Right; and those, that have the Wardship for the present, have not the right, they have but <hi>quasi jus;</hi> And if a Congregation useth Foreign Elders, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders can have a charge in it; but until such time as the Congregation be able to have Officers of it self. And therefore if, in cases of Defect, Congregations should be associated; and by vertue of their association, make use of other Elders; yet they are not to be kept in that Defect, they ought, and they may purchase to themselves such an Eldership, and so exercise their own Right. The Churches of Christ, are not to be kept under Age and Wardship. Yea, ye ought to reform so, as the Churches should be reduced to this, and have their Rights. The Bishops, because they would Rule the Churches, in ancient time, made Canons, that there should be but one Minister in a Church, and they took away the power of ruling Elders, and so did destroy the Presbytery in every Church, that so in this Defect, there might be a colour for their Government. Whatever inconveniences therefore may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, or whatever is the present State of things, nothing ought to prejudice the Rights of Churches; but all Congregations should have liberty to procure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a sufficient Eldership, so to have the Government within themselves.</p>

                  <p> Again, Suppose that such Congregations, as having a Defect of Elders, should subject themselves to a Classical Presbytery for Government, untill they had a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Eldership of their own: Suppose (I say) that this should be the more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary condition, of the most Congregations in this Kingdom; yet those Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that have a sufficient Eldership, are not, for uniformitie's sake with them, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themselves thereto. For uniformity, with what the Holy Ghost in the Word holds forth as perfect, is rather to be held by those Congregations, who are made thus compleat, than for uniformitie's sake, to subject themselves to the condition of those that are imperfect, that all may be alike, although that hath been the way of uniformity, that hath been urged amongst us; that because all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters cannot pray out of their own Gifts, that therefore for uniformitie's sake, there should be Forms of Prayer for all Ministers to use, even those that God hath inabled with sufficiency of Abilities, and Gifts to pray. It is in this case, as in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of fashions, many fashions being brought up by those that had infirmities, on purpose to cover them; they, who had infirmities, must be obliged to them, because they are in fashion, and brought up by some great ones.</p>
                  <p>Congregational Presbyteries, they are the Natural Presbyteries, those others, they are but as Step dames, Secondaries; they are but Compounds, and Decompounds of the several Presbyteries, of Presbyterial Churches.</p>
                  <p>And what though a Congregation with Elders, they are yet a Church to our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are so to be acknowledged, as the Church in the <hi>Canticles</hi> was a Sister, though she wanted Breasts. If Congregations be small, and want sufficiency of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; they should be united many of them together to one Church, that they may have a full Eldership, and put themselves (though to some conveniences) to come together to Worship, for so, in the Primitive times, we find that Christians did often come out of Villages to their Cities, to Worship on the Lord's Day; and sometimes removed out of the Villages, into the Cities, that they might have Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. But suppose that Congregations, having a sufficient Eldership, have also both Power and Ability, and right to act within themselves; yet in a constant way, may they not ask Advice and Counsel, and oblige themselves so to do; and before they proceed to Excommunication against their Members, if they be obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, bring them to the Classical Presbytery, as to a further means, there to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished; and to have the Sentence of Excommunication there discerned by them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. All communion with Classical Presbyteries (which we rather look upon as Synods, than Presbyteries) that we may lawfully hold, we will hold; and all such Communion we do account lawful, as is for such ends and purposes, for which they are ordained unto by Christ. But what is beyond the ground of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Associations, or of calling such Synods, and the use and end of them, that will be to put an unlawful power into them; for every Ordinance, or Institution of God, is commensurable to the ground upon which it is founded. So as suppose for the present, that God had appointed Synods to be held on some occasions, in case of Mal-Administrations in Congregations; and in that case, had endowed Synods with the same power over Churches, that Congregations have over their own Members; yet because they had this power in this case, and upon this ground, it would not draw on an obligation in the Churches Congregational, constantly to advise with them so; and to bring their Members to be Admonished by them, afore they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to censure. So as such advice, as this, is not a case of Appeals; which always supposeth a Sentence past in inferiour Courts already; But it is a laying the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation yet lower; for it is a Suspending the exertion of that primary and first right, which they had, until such time as they have advised with another, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed more sufficient and able Eldership.</p>
                  <p>It is with us in this particular respect, unto the Presbyteries, as it was with those that were moderate Separatists, in respect of their Communion with the Ministry of <hi>England,</hi> although we, in other cases, give more to these Presbyteries, than they would do to such a Ministry. Many of them, as Mr. <hi>Robinson</hi> and others, could communicate with the Ministry of <hi>England,</hi> in Hearing, and in Praying; because in these actions, they were not necessarily, or only to be considered as Ministers, by all them that should communicate with them; there being other grounds say they,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:154381:73"/> upon which they might Preach and Pray; and therefore although there was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful relation or respect, which they pretend to Preach upon; namely, that they were Ministers; yet because there was another ground, upon which (suppose there had been no Ministers) they might have Preached; hence therefore they did, and could communicate with them in these Ordinances, so far as that other ground would bear them out. But if it came unto any act, wherein they should properly shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be Ministers, in these they did abstain, and could not partake with them; for thereby (according to their Principles) they might have acknowledged them to be such, which they thought they were not, and to have that Authority, which they thought they had not. Therefore if it came to the receiving of the Sacrament, because this is a Ministerial act; they therefore would not communicate with them, no not for one moment. So also as touching classical Presbyteries, we can, and shall willingly communicate with them, in all such things wherein we think there is a ground for their Erection; and so far as there is such a ground, we can Preach among them, and hear them Preach, where a company of Elders might resolve ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Conscience, we can pray with them; yea, and have recourse to them for Advice in cases of difficulty, being the Elders of other Churches, and able to Resolve such cases. And this we can do, although we conceive that they are erected to a further end, and invested with a further power, which is to us unlawful: But wherein there is a proper acknowledgment of such a power, or that the former right of Congregations mentioned shall be prejudiced, and the Power and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that Jesus Christ hath put in them, impaired we cannot do any act that shall joyn with them herein. We cannot do it, no, not for one Moment, much less for a constancy. And the Reasons why we Judge Congregations should not do all this, Namely, Advise constantly, bring their obstinate Members to be Admonished by the Presbytery, nor require their Sentence, ere they proceed to Excommunicate, are these.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 1. If it were no more but to advise, that liberty is not to be taken from a Body of Christ, enabled by him to act within it self, and purchased by him; which is not to be taken from a Man, by a State or Common-wealth; because the Law of Nature hath bestowed it upon him. That liberty is not to be taken from a Church in its right, which the Law of Christ gives it; that is not to be taken from a Man in his right, which the Law of Nature giveth him. In all actions that a Man is the guide of himself in, he is not bound to seek advice, much less, that there should be a standing Court erected for Men to come into. And in all the other rights that a Man hath, as he is a Ruler or Governour of any Society? as suppose he be a Master of a Family, in which he hath a right by the Law of Nature, it would be an infringement of his Liberty, if in those acts, that belong unto him as a Master, he should be bound to advise with others, as for the putting away of a Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To direct him indeed, in what cases he should ask advice, the exigents and necessity of the thing is the ground and foundation of it; but out of those cases, it is an impairing of his liberty. Wherein he thinks there is a danger of miscarrying, and wherein he himself wants light, therein he is to ask advice, because there is a ground for it; and yet therein a Man is at liberty, of whom, or with whom he will advise; and to take that away, were to take away from the priviledge of a Man, if Men are to preserve their Native Priviledges, Churches are much more to stand fast in the liberty Christ hath purchased for them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 2. That which the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> having Power and Jurisdiction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves, were not obliged to do, nor were to oblige themselves to do, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had a <hi>Synedrim,</hi> a set Court set over them by God, for advice in cases Difficult, and when it was too hard for them to Judge) that the Churches now under the Gospel, having the like priviledges of power within themselves, with a promise of God to be amongst them, are not to do, nor are others to usurp it: For in cases not Difficult, it had been an usurpation of an unlawful power in the <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> to require, they should ask their advice; and it had been a Diminishing of that right and questioning of that promise of God's being with them in Judgment, to have gone still and advised, in cases clear, especially to have always depended upon an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritative Sentence of Judgment, required of them to be pronounced by the <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,</hi> before that they proceeded; and without which, theirs should not have been valid.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:154381:73"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 3. A constancy of seeking advice, and to be bound to it, doth in it self arise unto a Subjection to Authority; thus it is Subjection in a Child, to be bound to advise with his Parents in all actions of moment (whether they be clear to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or not) as disposing of himself in Marriage, and the like; and it is an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of an Authority. Yea, to be bound thus always to advise with, and not to proceed without the Sentence of a classical Presbytery, in Judgment, is of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Authority in some respect; and is more than for them to have a coercive Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over other Congregations, in case they proceed amiss. It is a further limiting of them, thus to tie them up, that they should not exercise Government without them. For Magistrates may Coerce the Churches, if they do amiss; when yet they will not oblige Ministers always to advise with them, and have their Sentence afore they proceed. For one Minister to depend thus on another, for the exercise of his calling, is more than to be subject to the censure of another, if he doth exercise his calling amiss. It is a greater sign of Servitude, to do what one doth by the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, than to be under Authority, that shall punish him if he do amiss: This latter is the case of a Subject, the other of a Servant. This especially is true, when as those, we should be bound to advise with, do claim and challenge an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, upon which it should be done (as those that are for the Presbyterial Government in a rigid way do.) It was one great ground, that the Antient Non-conformists went upon, against yielding to Ceremonies, that supposing they were things indifferent; yet to have things indifferent in the Worship of God, Determined one way, and Men obliged to practise one way, when as God himself had left them indifferent; this was to give away that liberty, which Jesus Christ had given us. Especially when as these, that urged them, pretended to have a Right and Power from Christ, to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine things indifferent in the Worship of God; in that case to have submitted to them, had been to have acknowledged an unlawful power.</p>
                  <p>We will put this Parallel case, to be judged by their own Principles, that are for the Presbyterial Government. Suppose there were found one Man in a Presbytery, that is but an ordinary Minister for his Station, in a particular Congregation (and so he hath a right and lawful calling in the Ministry) and (as it is possible there may, and oftentimes it doth fall out to be) suppose that this Man hath more Abilities for Wisdom, Holiness, and all other Ministerial Gifts; than all the rest of that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, suppose such an one as <hi>Calvin,</hi> who was an ordinary Minister of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and an Elder in the Presbytery there. If now that Presbytery he liveth in, having a a right and an ability in themselves, as a Presbytery, to Judge and Determine in all cases that fall, within the Jurisdiction thereof, should oblige themselves not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Sentence without his advice, in a peculiar manner first asked, they would think it both a Blessing of their Authority, and a giving of too much Authority to that Man; much more if this obligation should lie upon other Presbyteries, whereof he is not a Member. This step (which was the first Episcopal Authority) the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians would think unlawful to allow unto such a Man; and in this point, they are so tender, as they will not yield so much as a constant Moderatorship, without any other power; and yet that there should be always one Moderator, in such an Assembly, is necessary, if there be an order kept up amongst them, as is in other Bodies. But now for a Congregation to advise with a Superiour Presbytery, in a constant way, is not so much as necessary; for where there is no need of advice, it is not necessary. Let this case and the other, be Paralleled, and see whether there may not be the like said for Congregations, they having this right amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>The constancy of asking advice upon all cases, though it were pretended to be but advice; yet the act it self, by reason of its constancy, would argue a Majority of Power and Rule, it would turn to such in them (at least in the issue) that already claim it; and so claim it, as that some of the Presbyterians pretend all the power to be in the classical Presbytery, and not in the Congregational; and that the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Elders, in their act of Excommunication, are but the Deputies of the classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Presbyteries, and that they are <hi>Praecones,</hi> the Proclaimers only of the Sentence; but the Presbyterians are the Judges. That power that is already in one Kingdom, hath a <hi>jus divinum,</hi> and if set up in another, would pretend to it; and when the plurality of Men shall be once for it (for the Rigidity of that power) it will draw up all the power to it self. And a Churches yielding, from such Liberties and Priviledges,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:154381:74"/> is by God's usual Dispensation, the loss of them in the issue, <hi>To whom we yielded not,</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>no, not for an Hour, that the Truth of the Gospel might continue with you,</hi> Gal. 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>When the Court challenged (about the choice of Masters of Colledges) this as the priviledge of the King, that the Party should at least be made known to him, the University stood upon their Priviledges, that they might choose and admit, without giving notice to the Court; knowing that they should soon loose their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if but so much were given up to a greater power over them. Had there been yielding but for a time, it would have indangered, in the issue and consequence, the very continuance of that Truth of the Gospel, which in that respect was professed by them. <hi>Periculosum est in rebus Divinis ut quis suo jure cedat ac potestate, Cyprian Epist. ad Jubaian de heret. Baptiz:</hi> And all those Arguments, which were brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Bishops, as having a direct power over Ministers, will fall in here; for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective power is that, when the exercise of it is at the direction of another.</p>
                  <p>And farther, consider that, what will make the Church to be under Age, and to be a Child for Knowledge, and guided of it self, is unlawful; but always to ask advice, and to be bound so to do, is to bring the Church under Age, and so to be in Bondage (for to be under Age, and in Bondage, is all one, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 2, 3.) to be as well under these Tutors, as under Governours; under Tutors, whom they must advise withal; and under Governours, whose Authoritative Sentence must first be asked.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 4. That which the Churches of the Primitive Times did, having a Right and an Ability to do it, and was a Duty lay upon them, to do of themselves, that should Congregational Churches, having a right to do now, do without having first Recourse for advice to Presbyteries. And what the Apostles, though set over Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and who were more able to advise, than all the Presbyteries now are, did not yet require of the Churches; but blamed them, if they neglected to proceed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that Presbyteries are not now to require of the Churches to do, which the Apostles did not. But for Churches then to advise with the Apostles or Evangelists, or extraordinary Officers, before they proceed to Excommunicate, was not then requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but it was their Duty to proceed of themselves, according to the power Christ had given them, without waiting for such advice This is clear in the case of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> (whether it were Congregational or Presbyterial, we dispute not now) because that this Church had a Right to Judge that Incestuous <hi>Corinthian;</hi> and the Fact was so evident, that advice they needed not <hi>(Do not ye Judge</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>them that are within?</hi> Doth it not belong to you) he blameth them, that they did it not. And as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith, <hi>he accuseth them,</hi> not that <hi>they did not certifie him of it;</hi> but because <hi>they had not mourned, or thrown him out. The Apostle thus shewing, that it ought to have been done without a Monitor, because of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Sin:</hi> And when they had neglected to do it, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not do it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; but only as an Apostle Doctrinally declareth such an one to be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church he liveth in. He doth not require, that they should come unto him for his Sentence, before they did it; but he calleth upon them to do it themselves because they neglected it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 5. That which is to be supposed needless, that is not to be done in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant way. To go ask advice, when there is no need of advice, is needless. The <hi>Synedrim</hi> was God's Ordinance in its place, but if the Cities should still have come up for advice needlesly, they would not have found a Blessing in it. And besides that which is an acknowledgment of the Deficiency of God's Ordinance, and God's Presence with his own Ordinance, that ought not to be done; but such a constant having recourse for advice, is acknowledgment of such an insufficiency; for if they do not want it, why should they be bound to ask it?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 6. Let this obligation to advise with another Presbytery, and for them to approve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ere that a Church (that hath Power and Ability from Christ) proceed to Excommunicate, be but Parallel'd with the obligation of a particular Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister or Pastor, for the works of his Office; which, by vertue of his Office, he is enabled, by Christ, to do singly, and alone; the Presbytery of a Congregation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as was said) as perfect and as compleatly inabled, for all acts within it self, as a particular Minister can be supposed alone to be enabled to the works of his Office, (suppose Preaching, and the like) God's means being as perfect for Government, as
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:154381:74"/> they are for Preaching or Baptizing. Now then, as it would be a Derogation from the Gifts of Christ, and from the Office that Christ hath put a Man into; and a Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Man that is a Minister, constantly to advise afore he performs any act of his calling; and be bound so to do, before he Preacheth a Sermon, or the like. The like Dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation would it be to a Church, and the Presbytery thereof, to be obliged to advised, for all their acts of Government, which they perform. And yet look what ground or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there will be, for a Man that is a Preacher, to advise with others of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, about what he is to Preach; the like will be acknowledged, and as far the one, as the other, in their several proportions, for a Congregational Church, and the Presbytery thereof, to advise with other Churches. If a Minister should be to Preach any thing that is of great Difficulty, and like to be much gainsaid, and contradicted, any thing that is of great Moment, or new, or uncouth; in that case he may do well to advise, afore he Preacheth, and have the Judgment of his Brethren. So if such a case of Government cometh, in any kind, that hath a great difficulty in it, wherein they are not clear what they shall do, or they, upon grounds, think that the way, they are to proceed, is like to be offensive and scandalous to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, about them when done; in this case they may advise. Occasional advisings, so far as there is a ground for them, we deny not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 7. That which a classical Presbytery is not bound to do to a Provincial, nor a Provincial to a National Assembly; that upon the same grounds a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (if it have a sufficient Presbytery) is not bound to do to a classical Presbytery. What ground can be alledged, why a classical Presbytery is not bound to advise with a Provincial Assembly, ere it proceeds to Excommunication, but this? That it is an Ordinance sufficient for those acts, within it self. If then a Congregation be by Christ inabled (he having given sufficiency of Power, and Gifts among them) to do all acts within it self. Why should this Church (which the promise of Christ's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to be among them, is first made to) which is the Seat both of Worship and Government, be deprived of its priviledge, when the others are not. Where Jesus Christ hath given Power, he hath given Gifts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 8. What is it they should advise thus constantly for, and about what should they depend upon the Sentence of a classical Presbytery? First, it is not out of want of Skill; for that must be either of the <hi>Jus,</hi> that is, that they are unskillful, to know the Rule, for what sins Men should be Excommunicated. Now in the constant cases that fall out in Congregations, for which Men should be Excommunicated, the Rule is known well enough; that Excommunication is for such and such gross sins as the Scripture holds forth, and as are Scandalous to all Christians; and if any new cases fall out, let them advise. And we acknowledge, that <hi>Synods</hi> may be of use to find out those Rules, and to hold them forth; But when once they are held forth and known, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received, there needs no advice to know the matter of right, for which Men are to be Excommunicated. Or else it must be want of Skill, of judging the matter of Fact done; and for that they need not advise, for it is to be proved by Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. A company of Elders, and a Congregation, may as well be able to judge of that, as all the Assemblies in the World; and may be thought as sufficient, and as faithful to judge, whether the Fact be fully proved and cleared by Witnesses, or no, or is it want of skill, in that Judging, what obstinacy and impenitency is. As for that (as I said before) they are intrusted to Judge of it; for if they will receive him upon his Repentance, without bringing him to the classis, they may; neither are they to bring him thither, till he is obstinate. Secondly; It is not to have Authority from the Sentence of that Synod, that advice is necessary. For that Authority, must either be an Authority of Reverence only, or a further power Political. There needs not a further Political power, to be judged by their Sentence; for if a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Presbytery thereof, should proceed to Excommunication, the party was as truly Excommunicated, and with as full a power from Christ, as if all the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods in the World had ratified it. And therefore to add Authority, as Defective in the Congregation, to that end their Sentence is needless. And then when a Man is to be Excommunicated, he is to be Excommunicated by them; when it is done, it is done by them; and if a classis addeth not Authority, it should not take away this Authority, by obliging Men to advise, and to have their Sentence first. If of Reverence only, then it should be giving a respectful Deference to their Judgments, which in some cases is allowable.</p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:154381:75"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 9. Those Admonitions which the classical Presbytery are to give to the Person that is brought before them, by the Elders of his Congregation (they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves Admonished him, and he remained obstinate under their Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) are either an Instituted Ordinance of Christ, Preparatory to Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be further applyed to him, over and above those given him by his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: Or they are to work in a way of Moral perswasion, and by the way Reverence, that the person hath of the classical Presbytery, more than of his own Congregation; that is, they either work politically, as an Institution of Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, or only Morally. For what is it, by which this Man's Conscience must be wrought upon, in these Superadded Admonitions of the classical Presbytery, having been obstinate under those of his own? It must either be <hi>vi materiae,</hi> by reason of the matter; and that they have a great Reverence in the Man's Conscience; or it must be by their being invested with an Authority from Christ. And if these Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the classical Presbytery be as an Institution Preparatory, they are to be reckoned Ordinances of the same Rank and Kind, with those which the Elders of his own Church hath given him; which Admonitions are not as if a company of Saints or Ministers should meet him occasionally, and Admonish him; (for he may have a Thousand such Admonitions, and yet his sin not be accounted ripe for Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication) but his sin is then ripe for Excommunication, when Admonitions Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterially Administred, by such as Christ hath appointed, have been Administred to him, and he continues obstinate. So that Admonitions either may be said to have a perswasive power only, or else a Ministerial power by way of Institution; and so work on a Man by the Blessing of God upon them, and by vertue of the promise: And, in the want of either of them, a Man cannot be judged fit to be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated; because that Christ's means, appointed by him, have not been applyed to him. So then every Admonition, in this way of Ordinance, is in order unto Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, if the Person continues obstinate.</p>
                  <p>Now then first; if it be such a necessary Ordinance to be Administred by the clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Presbytery, afore such time as the party can be Excommunicated; Then 1. The Congregational Eldership, and the Admonitions thereof, is not a perfect Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And 2. It were not only a sin, for any Congregational Church to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate a Man, without bringing of him first to the classical Presbytery; but the Man also is not capable, till then, of being Excommunicated by his own Church; for it may be said, there wants an Ordinance to be applyed to him, before he is to be Excommunicated; for all such Admonitions, that are a special Ordinance of Christ, as being preparatory to Excommunication, and in order thereunto, are not to be omitted. And let it be shewn, that Christ hath divided by his Institution, that some Admonitions should be in a Man's own Congregation, by his own Eldership, and others afterward to be by a classical Presbytery, before he is to be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his own Church. And also 3. If it were thus, then a Congregational Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery hath not sufficient power to Excommunicate a Man; for if he is, by vertue of an Institution, to be Admonished, also by a classical Presbytery, this Presbytery must, by Institution, have power also to give Sentence, without which, the Sentence of the Congregation were not sufficient; for that Church which hath power to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish publickly, in order to Excommunication, must necessarily have the power al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to joyn in the Excommunication, or else the Excommunication is not valid.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly; If they be Admonitions only in a perswasive way, to a Man that is obstinate, to work upon him, as, and with a Reverence of the persons Admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to that end, he is brought to the classical Presbytery, to be Admonished, consider what will follow from it. 1. That those Ministers should rather be called out, which he in a peculiar manner most Reverenceth; they being the fittest Persons to give Admonitions, as <hi>John Baptist</hi> was to Admonish <hi>Herod,</hi> because <hi>Herod</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced him (as the Text saith) and therefore to make an Admonition-Court, of a certain sort of persons, whom perhaps the Man knows not, this is to extend it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what the ground of a Reverence will always reach unto. And by this reason likewise, there might be some one man, of Eminent Gifts, set up to Admonish, which should move a greater Reverence in the Hearts of Men, more than half a Dozen Presbyteries. 2. If he be brought only upon this ground, to be thus Admonished by them; then a meer Moral Ordinance of less force, is preferred to a standing Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ordinance, that, according to Christ's Institution, is of a greater: a Moral power
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:154381:75"/> is preferred to a political that is given by Christ, whereas on the other side, the means, that a Man's own Congregation hath used, being Instituted means, the Blessing of Christ depends upon it.</p>
                  <p>Its true, we grant that if a company of Saints, or a company of Ministers occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally meet him, they might admonish him, and God may bless it; but when those means, that Christ hath appointed, hath past upon him, and he is not wrought upon by them, then for us to set up any other Court of a Company of Men, to bring him unto; which, by Christ's appointment, hath a power of a lesser kind (as if it is but a Moral Reverential power, it is no more) this is but a Secondary and remote power, in comparison of the former. It is but Perswasive, it is not Ministerial, and perswasive Admonitions were applyed to him afore, and he was past them; he was Admonished by the Brother in private, he was Admonished by two or three more, which that Brother took to joyn with him; and therefore in a Congregation, Christ brings him to an Authoritative means, which himself hath in a publick manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted; and to bring him then from these means, unto perswasive means again; this must needs fall short, and be blasted to this Man's Conscience, when the means, that Christ hath in a special manner instituted, had taken no place upon him; and this would also make Jesus Christ to proceed, from the greater to the lesser: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be affirmed by those, who hold that the Congregations have a sufficient Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery for Excommunication, yet Christ's appointment is; that classical Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries must always joyn with them, without which they are imperfect, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a condition. Thus there is the shew of an ordinance set up, to the prejudice of the ordinance of Christ; whereas there should not be set up an Image to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble any appointment of Christ; and if any thing, put into the road of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, be in the stead of an ordinance, or preferred to an ordinance, it will grow flat, though of it self it be good, and, upon occasion, may be useful; as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the admonitions of a classical Presbytery may be; but not in this case. We acknowledge that such an admonition, God may bless, as he may bless good conference; but if any would set up good conference, as a more efficacious ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance than Preaching, when Preaching is the special ordinance, there would not be found that blessing in it.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, but may not all good means be used, to reclaim a Man that is obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, before he be proceeded against by Excommunication? And is it not good means, to be admonished by a company of Men Grave and Holy; and is not this bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than to be admonished only by those of a Man's own Congregation?</p>
                  <p>I answer 1. That the goodness of all means lies in the Blessing and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ; and if he have appointed means sufficient, as the admonitions of the Eldership of a particular Congregation is, then in a constant and set way, to have an admonition Court, to bring Men unto, further to be admonished, hath not a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for it. If the Congregational Presbytery be a sufficient Presbytery; then they are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> sufficient means; and Cursed is he that addeth, as well as he that takes from Christ's Institution, he that will use more than Christ hath appointed, as well as he that will use less. In this case we may say, If they will not <hi>believe</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they believe if one come from the Dead;</hi> because God had appointed <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, to be a sufficient means. And thus in Physick also, to use more than is prescribed, is as dangerous as to use less. And further, if he is to be accounted obstinate, after the admonition of his own Congregation, so as to be Excommunicated (as if they be a sufficient means, he is to be so accounted) then as God cutteth Men off, when their sins are ripe, so the Church also doth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. If all good means were to be set up, as instituted ordinances, then this Man should be brought to be admonished by the principal Assembly, before he is Excommunicated; yea, and before the National too (if you will set the bounds in a classical Presbytery; why had you not as good set them in a Congregational (if a Congregational be sufficient) where Christ hath set it?) For you may sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose still, that if he had the provincial Assemblie's admonition (Men of greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Reverence) it might prevent his Excommunication. And besides, if he may, after his Excommunication, appeal to them, why should he not be brought unto them before?</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:154381:76"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 10. Add to this, that until the Delinquent hath been Admonished, before all the People of the Congregation, he hath not had all the means applyed unto him, in his own Congregation, which Christ hath appointed to work Repentance in him: For the whole Church is not told of it, as Christ would have it; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he Rebuked before all, so that all may mourn and lament over him, to break his Heart. And surely, it is the right of every Congregation, and of every Member in it, to have all means used, that are sufficient within that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, afore its Members are brought▪ before Strangers. Now if they are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished by the classical Presbytery; after that they have been thus admonished twice or thrice, publickly in the Congregation, then, in that respect also, there is a proceeding from a greater, and more sufficient means unto a less sufficient: For the admonition of the classical Presbytery, though given by publick Persons, yet it is given privately; whereas the means according to Christ's Order, is to go from more private, to more publick, as a way of doing the person good. And the shame is more publick afore the Congregation, than afore the Consistory; and therefore, according to the Presbyterial practices, they are admonished first by the classical Presbytery, and when they are found obstinate, there they have two or three admonitions publickly before the people, afore he is Excommunicated; which admonitions, if they are in order to Repentance, then they are more Efficacious, than what hath been done in the consistory of Elders, and therefore used last; and and if more Efficacious, why (according to the right of a Congregation, and according to the sufficiency of means in a Congregation) were they not used first, so as the person need not be brought, in order to his Repentance, before the classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Presbytery; because a more sufficient means hath already been used? So that in a word, they are carryed unto the Presbytery, either afore or after they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished publickly in the Congregation; if afore, all good means have not been used in the Congregation; If after, you go from a more Efficacious means, unto a less Efficacious, even in that respect forementioned also.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 11. When the Apostle saith, Tit. 3. 10. <hi>after one or two Admonitions, him that is an Heretick Reject,</hi> as condemned of himself, as much by those means, as by a Thousand; the admonitions he intendeth there, are those that are publick, and given by them that have the power of Excommunicating. If he be admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nished afore his own Congregation, and the Elders thereof, these are either such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions the Apostle there intendeth, or not; if they be, he is to be rejected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being admonished by any other; for the Apostle's Rule plainly evidenceth, that there is but one kind of publick power, by which the admonitions should be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And therefore if the classical Presbytery were that power, which should Reject and Excommunicate this Man, upon their two or three admonitions; then he is not to be brought down, to have admonitions again, afore the people in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; but he is to be Rejected, without any further proceeding; so that if he be brought to the classical Presbytery, after he hath been admonished before the whole Congregation, the Apostle's rule is not observed, or if he be brought to the Congregation, after he hath been with those that have the publick power, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and cast him out; the Apostle's rule is not observed neither; and thus whereas God hath built one or two Altars, this would be to build seven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 12. That practice, which will breed distractions, and more inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ought not to be. But for a Congregation, that is supposed to have sufficient power in it self, to depend upon the classical Presbytery, for a Sentence first past, will breed greater inconveniences, than for them to proceed without them. For the first, if the Congregational Eldership be of one mind, that a Man ought to be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and the classical Presbytery is of another, the Congregational Eldership having sufficient power, and the Conscience of Duty lying upon them, they are to proceed notwithstanding; and so by rejecting the advice aforehand, of the classical Presbytery, they are brought to cast a greater contempt upon it, than if they had proceeded without their Sentence, and so as to give them an account. And as for the party, if he will refuse to go afore the classical Presbytery (his conscience judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that upon right grounds, that the Congregation hath sufficient power, to proceed against him) what Rules, in Scripture, will compell him to go to be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished afore them? If he goes by an Appeal, that's after Sentence, and then the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:154381:76"/> Congregation and he are parties; if he goes as complained of by the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by what rule can they constrain him to it?</p>

                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. THat Excommunication is a matter of so great weight, to give a Man up unto Satan, to throw him out of the Communion of Saints, as that for the weight and greatness of the Sentence, it should be advised upon, by a further Eldership, by a greater company, than those of a Man's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. You greaten the ordinance of Excommunication, as the Papists did that of the Lord's Supper, preferring it before Preaching, and so magnified the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the Priests that Consecrated the Sacrament, and also drew the people to the Worshipping of the Bread. Thus you also advance an undue power of the Clergy, combined in an Association of particular Congregations; and to take their power away, under pretence of the greatness of the ordinance committed to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. And yet, it is not so great and dreadful a Sentence, according to your own opinion, making it only to be a cutting off of a Church, and not to import a formal delivering up unto Satan. And</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. If the Congregation, and the Eldership thereof, be sufficient for power and skill, and faithfullness; why, for the greatness of the Sentence, should there be a going out to other Churches, when Christ hath proportioned his means to his end? And what is there in the Execution of a Brother, that these may not be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be sufficient for, and to be betrusted with? They are betrusted to Preach the word, every particular person is (whether it prove Error or Truth) till he do miscarry. They are betrusted to admit Members, to Suspend from the Sacrament? why not to Excommunicate? Yea, the Sentence, and the proof it self, depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two or three Witnesses by God's appointment, and they cast it; and this, though the matter were brought before all the Judges in the World; then why not, when the matter is brought afore two or three Officers, faithful Men, and a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints; why should not they be esteemed as faithful Judges, as others? If you commit to a Jury, and one Judge, a Recorder or a Lawyer in an Incorporate Town, though decayed, the power of Life and Death, and cutting a Man off from this life, which when it is done, cannot be remedyed again; then why should you not betrust the power of cutting a Man off from the Church (if it be unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, as being in this case the Judges and Jury) Especially, when as there may be a remedy? For he is not so cut off, but he may be restored.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 5. Wherein should the greatness of Excommunication lie, but in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for which a Man is Excommunicated? We Profess, it is not for niceties; but for sins against light, against the common principles of Nature, and Christianity; as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3. He that hath so done this Deed. There must be a <hi>Scelus</hi> in it, that, if he goes on in it, will Damn his Soul; and therefore the Apostle calls that <hi>Corinthian, That wicked Person</hi> ver. 13. And for these things, the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as well able to judge, as all the Elders in the World. In the matter of sact, (as was said afore) a Jury of Twelve men, do judge of the Fact, when a man's Life is concerned; and by a parity of reason, a Congregation may judge of the matter of fact, for which a man is to be thrown out of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But Excommunication is, <hi>Res communis, a common concern,</hi> which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Neighbour Churches have an interest in, and in that respect, they are to have a joynt concurrence in it aforehand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. So it is likewise, to all the Churches in the World, more especially in the Nation, and the party may remove to any other part of the Kingdom; and so, then all the Kingdom should have a concurrence in the act aforehand as well, and then the whole Nation should be called.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. If the common interest of Churches should carry it, then it would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that because he is Excommunicated out of all the Churches of that Presbytery, all the Churches should be present at his Excommunication, as well as that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church he is a Member of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. If Neighbourhood and common interest be insisted on, then the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the next Presbytery (whereof many may be nearer to that Congregation, to which he is joyned, than this classical Presbytery) should be present also; for the Man may go thither to be received, and therefore it is fit that they should have an interest aforehand too. There is no Reason to be given, why it should be <hi>Res communis, A common affair,</hi> to that classical Presbytery, more than to other Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches, as to the thing it self, it can only be said, they have associated vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily: But then the ground of that Association must be considered.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. When a Man is cast out of one Church, he is cast out of all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but not formally, but only consequently, and by vertue of communion of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, this common Law being among them, that no other Church should receive him, till he have given satisfaction to his own; and therefore answerably, it is not an antecedent cognisance afore, and by other Churches, that it is necessary, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a consequent, as was the manner of the Primitive times, to send to Churches after, and to tell them, from such an one let us abstain, this being the Law among Churches; that if a Man be cast out of one Church, he is cast out of all; either all Churches must be called, one as well as another, or else some particular Church must be betrusted, and betrusted by Christ; and if so, why not his own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having a sufficient Eldership for Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 5. In admission (as was urged afore) every particular Church is betrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to admit Members; and, by vertue of the admission of Members into it, they are admitted to have communion in all Churches; and therefore, why should it not be intrusted for Excommunication also. It is no obstacle, that it is <hi>Res communis, A common Business;</hi> for the other is equally such, to all other Churches. We ask also, if that Suspension be not <hi>Res communis, A common concern</hi> also, insomuch, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till such time as he is Excommunicated, all Churches are to Suspend him from the Sacrament, after his own Church hath Suspended him? And if so, upon that ground, why should not all Churches be acquainted with his Suspension aforehand?</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Let them have the use of Councellours only, and we deny it not. A Man will not go for Counsel, unless there be need; and in cases of need, we do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. That Rule is the Rule of Nature; but we have a Rule for the sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Eldership of a Congregation, with an Institution, and with a promise of Christ's presence, <hi>where two or three are gathered together.</hi> If this were founded upon meer Nature; then we would yield, that this <hi>Axiom</hi> might have place, and they might still take in more Councellours to them. But a Rule of Nature, will not set up an ordinance, though it may help to manage it; and it should not be set to weaken it, and disparage it, as this doth. Let us rest in God's ordinance, and rest in God's number, what he hath thought sufficient; and the conscience will rather be quieted, and wrought upon by subjection to an ordinance, than to a multitude. The promise is not to a company of more persons, as such; but the promise is made to the relation, to the constitution, and the blessing depends upon the promise; and to this purpose, God will be with two or three, as well as with three Thousand in an ordinary way. The Laws of <hi>England</hi> sets not up a multitude of Counsellours, that is, of Lawyers, for the Judging of Life and Death; but it sets up a few Judges, who sometimes alone, sometimes two or three together, do Judge all Causes, when yet there are multitudes of Lawyers, and as good Lawyers as they, and as able to Counsel. If we all do rest satisfied in this Law, as the ordinance of the Kingdom, why should we not rest in the other, as the ordinance of Christ?</p>

And then all the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es should continually have had recourse to the Apostles, while they were alive, in all such Acts of Discipline; for any Apostle might have said, am not I Wiser? Send them unto me; yea, cannot I more effectually perswade? Therefore both take my advice, and come to me for my Sentence; bring them afore me, to be admonished. The Apostles indeed, when they were present in Churches, did joyn with the Elders and Officers of the Churches, in their Acts of Government; but they did not require (if absent) that the Churches should come to advise with them.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. It is in the case of Peace, as in the case of Scandal. If a Brother be offended, and the thing be indifferent, and in my liberty; then indeed I may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, and I ought to forbear, because of an offence; but I am not to forbear, if it be a Duty which he is offended at; neither am I to give away a liberty: So for peace, Men may forbear things that are indifferent to them, and so they ought to do: Yea, they may conceal their own Judgments, and forbear to practice some things, which otherwise they might do; as the Apostle says, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22. <hi>Hast thou Faith? Have it to thy self.</hi> But a Man is to do nothing positive, that shall acknowledge a seeming power, and bring Congregations into Bondage, when Christ hath set them free; for Peace must be so kept in Churches, as that withal their priviledges must be kept. There is no yielding from that right, which Christ hath given. The case of peace holdeth not in the acknowledgment of a false power, for that will breed Destruction.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. It is the keeping of the true bounds of power, as Christ hath seated them, that will preserve the peace of Churches; but to yield unto a false power, will always be occasion of quarrels.</p>

But because that these Churches may be perhaps offended, with what you do, and with that Sentence you shall give, and so be ingaged to question you for that Act, after you have done it; is it not therefore better to advise aforehand, and so to prevent that offence?</p>

It was the preventing offences, and the avoiding of Schisms, that did set up Episcopal Power, as <hi>Jerome</hi> saith; for because a multitude of Presbyters could not agree in their Presbyteries, they devolved it into one Man; but the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was worse than the Disease; for it Degenerated into Tyranny.</p>

                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Simply to prevent an offence, the liberty of Churches, nor the rights that is in Churches, is not to be taken away. An actual offence arising is a ground indeed for the Neighbouring Churches, to call upon that Church, to give them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and there doth hereupon a Duty lie upon this Church, if it have miscarryed, to give them satisfaction. But then they must be actually offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

The case must be supposed so to fall out, that either the classical Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery will be of the same mind with the Congregational, or not. If it be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that they shall be of the same mind, then there needs not to be advice to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent offence; and this will ordinarily be the case, when the Rulers for Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation are fixt, and by some common Agreement, concluded upon between Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Or if it be supposed, they may not agree, in that case the Congregational Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery is put into a greater strait, and will run into an higher contempt and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Presbytery classical, when they shall think themselves bound to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate the Man, against the Advice and Sentence of the classical Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry given them.</p>

If, for avoiding of offences, there should be such advising always afore Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with other, or more or greater Churches; then the classical Churches should never give Sentence; for they may incur the offence of the Provincial, and this latter likewise of the National. And therefore, supposing that these Courts were one above ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that the inferior had a full Right and Power to finish the Sentence of Excommunication, it were much better, to leave it to the cognisance of the higher Courts, by way of Appeals, than under the presupposition and pretence, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences may arise to weaken the Right of the particular Congregation, by an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to advise, and to have the Sentence of the higher Court antecedent.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That the Church Universal is not a Church Political, and the Seat of Instituted Government.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I shall now examine the Validity of the Presbyterian claims for their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and first, I shall prove, that the Church Universal is not, in the whole, and in all the Subordinate parts of it, a Church-Political, and the Seat of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Government. The Church Catholick is not a formed Politick Body, which Christ hath made the Seat of this power. That it indeed affordeth fit materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, both of Saints and Men gifted, we grant, even as Men are by Nature, having variety of several parts, and variety of gifts, fitted to the Bodies Politick; and if you take all Mankind, there is, among them, variety of gifts, and Dispositions fitted to make up Common-wealths; yet all Mankind, taken together, are not a politick Body, but as they are formed up into Common wealths or Kingdoms; and Men, having thus several gifts, are put into several Offices and Places, in those several King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Common-wealths; which are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Humane Creature, as the Apostle calls it. Even so it is here.</p>
                  <p>We yield also, that take the Church Universal in its parts, and so the Keys are given to the whole <hi>partitive,</hi> as divided into several Bodies, in whom God hath set Teachers and Pastors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As we say he hath set, in a Kingdom, Constables and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:154381:79"/> Justices of the peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but yet every Constable is not a Constable of the whole Kingdom; so he hath set in his Church Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who were as the Nobles, and were Ministers, and had power in all Churches; yet exercised their power, <hi>per partes,</hi> as they came to this Church, and that Church; but he hath set other ordinary Officers, as other Justices of Peace in their several less Jurisdictions, or as Majors and Recorders in Incorporate Towns.</p>
                  <p>We yield also, that all these Churches, by vertue of their Catholick Relation, are knit together again in a common communion, on which they owe one unto another, by several Bands and Tyes, so as they have communion one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that as Churches too, and with their Elders, as Elders: But the present question is▪ of the Keys of Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. These Keys cannot be given to the whole Universal Church; for first they do not, nor indeed can assemble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The whole Universal Church, hath not all the Keys; for it is not capable of Preaching, nor is it capable of Receiving the Sacraments altogether. And suppose there were a General Council, of all the Ministers of the World, and they should receive the Sacrament; they should not receive it as Ministers, but they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it only as Believers.</p>
                  <p>That the Church-Catholicks on Earth, neither is, nor can be the Seat of this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship, nor of this Government, as appears by those Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It can no more be so, than all Mankind can make a Common wealth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 This is reserved to Heaven, which is the only General Assembly, where the Worship of God is perfected; to which all other particular Assemblies, the Family on Earth, come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If this power of Governing be given to the Church Universal; then either to a meeting of Elders, or of all the Faithful: Not of all the Faithful, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not meet as in Congregations they do; nor is there any Institution for all the Males to meet, as in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> nor for all the People, Male and Female, as once every Seventh year there, so these in some one place in the World. Neither is this power of Government, given to any meeting of Elders, as Elders to the Church Universal; for then either it must be, that God hath appointed a set company, as in the <hi>Synedrim,</hi> whose Office peculiarly it is, to be these Catholick Elders, set apart for that Work, as those who were Elders of the People (such in a manner were the Apostles,) And if so, let the ordinary Institution for this be shewn, such as theirs was for that, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 17. This indeed is the Popish principle, that all Bishops, are by Office Catholick Bishops; and may all, by their Office, attend a General Council: And thus as in <hi>Jury,</hi> God might have made two great ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, for the Government of his Church only; an Universal <hi>Synedrim</hi> for the Church Catholick (such as the Parliamentary power is in this Kingdom) and the other in that of Villages and Cities; there being none intermediate, or subordinate between them. But if it were so, then all intermediate Synods should be taken away, and only a <hi>General Council</hi> be <hi>that,</hi> to which all Congregations should Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. And that the Institution was not so, is evident by this, that all our Divines do acknowledge, that General Councils are but <hi>ad bene esse,</hi> and not absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, (which they would be, if the primary Institution fell upon them) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the first Three Hundred years, there was none. But if the meaning be, that each Elder is an Elder of the Church Universal; and that the Church Universal is a Politick Body, thoroughout from top to bottom, the greater part still Ruling the lesser, and the Universal Ruling the whole: So as by vertue of their Relation to the whole, they act in any part, or may act in the whole (which is according to the Principles that the Assembly goes upon, in their answer to our Reasons) then the Institution of the politick Power, is made to fall first, and primarily on the Church Universal; for in their first <hi>Praecognitum,</hi> they say the whole Church is one, made up of the collection of all; and that hence there is a dependency of all the lesser, as parts upon the whole. But</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Institution falls upon the Church Universal, then the Church Universal is a politick Body; and if so, then as this whole Church should be but one politick Body, so each Elder, should be an Elder to this whole Church, for all ends and purposes of an Elder, both for Worship and Government, for Elder and Church are Relative; as when the Apostle saith, <hi>Ordain the Elders to every Church,</hi> assuredly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:154381:79"/> they had the relation of Elders to that Church, both for Worship and Government. Now this will set up an unparallel'd Monster in Government, the like to which Mankind never knew; and therefore cannot be the Institution of Christ; for Christ's Government is orderly. Now the Monstrousness of this will appear. 1. This will make an external politick Government to be managed by Men, (by Christ the Head, we grant it is now managed) that is, greater than any of the Monarchies, which, through their vastness, were hurtful to Mankind, whom they Ruled. For the Church Universal on Earth, is now, and hath been ever since the Apostle's time, in most of Nations, As Mr. <hi>Brerewood</hi> proves. There are the <hi>Ethiopick</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Christians in <hi>Africa;</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> under the <hi>Turk:</hi> The <hi>Armenians</hi> under the <hi>Persian,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> Christians of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> so called, because he was the Converter of Christians there; then there are all which are in Europe: And that many of these Churches are, in a great measure, pure in their Doctrine, or at least have enough to save Men; and so cannot be excluded out of the List of the Church-Catholick, appeareth by that confession of Faith, made by Patriarch <hi>Cyrill,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Now to have so vast a Body to be in the whole, the Seat of Government (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if you add to it, when the fullness of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> shall come in, and the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> shall give themselves to Christ) how can this be practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And if not so, how can it be the Institution? It is true, that Christ's Internal Kingdom, and is thus large managed by himself, both in whole, and in part, and by his Spirit: But that his External Kingdom should be such, is inconceivable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That, which increaseth the wonder, is, that all these should be governed by a general Aristocracy, whereas that it should be governed, by one Man, would be more feasable: But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It makes it more strange, that this should further be the Law of it, that every Elder of every Congregation, should be the Elder of these Churches, yea, of the whole Church; for all acts of Government, and that he should be bound up in his constant function, and exercise to the compass of one Congregation; and yet have, by a Fundamental Institution, a Right of Eldership in power, in all the Churches of the World besides. See but how absurd such a Government will be in the like ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society, that were so vast a Body; suppose that in all these Countries mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or all over the World, the Forms of Government, that now are, should be pull'd down, and should begin anew; and that the Government should be, that the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomasters or Aldermen, yea, Constables of every little Town or Village, chosen by the People, should be an Alderman to all ends and purposes, in all Towns Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, Incorporate, yea, in Villages, to Hang and Draw, as occasion is, throughout the World, and to have as much Right, as any therein; and by vertue of the Law, this Duty should lie on him, to stir up others, and joyn with others (if there be any thing amiss) to assume the Authority to execute this. We read indeed, that in the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, it was the priviledge of private Persons, that he who was free of one City, <hi>Rome,</hi> was free of all the World, for Trading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that he should have power of Office in all Cities, was never heard of. This is a thing that never fell out, no not in <hi>Israel.</hi> There were indeed, general Elders, on purpose, appointed over all the Nation; but they were not Elders over every City. It is no where found, but in <hi>Turky,</hi> it is not to be parallel'd, but in that Government, which the <hi>Janizaries</hi> have, and among the Jesuits, it is the Law of their Society, but it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable to Princes, as was that of the Templers.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is strange, that Christ should appoint such a Government, and leave it loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the persons, if they be called (as that is the Limitation with which our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would mollifie it) to act in this, or that part of the Universal Church; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much as set down any of these things. In so great a Body, and Latitude of power, there had needed to have been, the most sure and certain Order, distinctly appointed by Christ. For let it be considered, how many things were to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: As whether there should be but one General Council, to which all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies should be brought, as in <hi>Israel</hi> the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> was: And whether it should be of a constant standing, or be chosen anew every year: Whether in it, there should be more of Ruling or Teaching Elders, or an equal number of both: Whether there should be many Subordinations of sorts of Elders, and how many of them; and by what Rules and Limits, set out; and what number of each Elders should be therein: And who should choose them which are to be sent, whether every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:154381:80"/> Elder meeting, as in provincial Assemblies they did, or whether a few chosen should choose the others. It is a wonder, that Christ hath set down none of these things, that he neither appointed one General Court, to which all Appeals should be brought; nor, if there were to be Subordinate Synods, hath assigned how many they should be, nor so much as declared, that there should be any such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination. And if the General Law of this supposed Government is, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greater number should Rule the less; this would be an exceeding loose, and confused foundation of a setled Government; and a setled Government, Christ must be supposed to have left. In this case therefore, surely there should, of necessity, be the most positive Law to determine what that call is, whereby such should execute it, as well as to lay down a Law for the right, or else every one of them would chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it; for every Man will say, he hath as good a Right as another, nay, greater.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Right would both give all a pretence to it, as also lay it upon them. For as it is their Duty (as it was <hi>Paul's)</hi> to take care of all the Churches, so they have a call already, by their Fundamental Relation. And then if Elders, chosen by the Churches, should determine one way; yet the rest having a Fundamental Right, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Catholick Elders by Institution, might Determine the other way; for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation is by vertue of their being Elders of this Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Christ never gave an Institution, which was never brought forth into Act; but such is this pretended Institution of a Catholick Church, to be the Seat of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because that Church can never meet; and as <hi>frustra est potentia, sic etiam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas quae non reducitur in Actum,</hi> i. e. <hi>not only Natural Power; but Authority too is in vain, which cannot be brought into the condition of Acting.</hi> Christ did not set up a Doctrinal Principle for Government, and <hi>policie</hi> in the Speculation; but such an one as is practical. And our Presbyterian Brethren make use of the Notion, yet reject the thing; for they would be unwilling, that a General Council of all Christians interested, should be the Major part, Determining all the parts of Government and Doctrine, and bind up all Churches thereunto. Surely Jesus Christ suited his Government of his Church to all times, and there have been few times, in the World, in which this could be done, no not by General Councils; Divisions have and will hinder it, Persecutions, or distance of place, or want of consent, who shall call them, will hinder it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cannot be, that the primary Institution should fall upon it; for then the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution should fall upon the Representative Church first, rather than on the Church both of the Faithful, and of the Elders too. But the Institution must rather be where both are; for they have more of the Reality of a Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God giveth Gifts and Abilities, suitable to all his Institutions; when God did call Apostles to an Universal Eldership, he gave them Gifts suitable: Now there are few, we may say none, of Elders that are fit to be Elders Catholick, that are fit to act in the Church Universal: And yet, every one in their place, every Ruling Elder, by this principle, must be supposed to be fit if called; for the Institution and their Office (according to this principle) doth give them the <hi>Jus,</hi> the Right, and the Ability; whereas the choice, by others, gives only the exercise; but the right, if founded upon an Institution, supposeth a fitness, or an Ability in all. That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bishop (who pretended to have an higher Degree of Office, than ordinary Elders, by Divine Institution) should be a Catholick Bishop (for by the Antient Canon Law, all Bishops, in the World, might be of a General Council, by vertue of their place) is far more supposable. For as by their principles, they were of an higher Function; so a supposition might be made, of a proportionably higher Eminency of Parts, and Gifts to be in them, above other Men, as in some few in the Church there eminently is, as well as there is a vast difference of Natural Gifts, among the Sons of Men. Thus as Bishops were supposed to be Men of an Higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, so, like <hi>Saul,</hi> they might be supposed Taller than their fellows. But to make all Elders, yea, Ruling Elders, (for they must come in too, if they be likewise by Institution) and all Ministers, Catholick Elders, and fit for General Councils, is to assert, that Christ hath also given to them all Gifts and Abilities, suitable to so Great a function and charge.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:154381:80"/> 4. God never called Men to do work in any part, which they are not capable of, as these Catholick Elders are not; for they ought to have variety of Languages, as God gave the Apostles. For if Appeals may be made, they are to hear every Man in his own Language speak for himself. When God did make Catholick Elders, Catholick Rulers, he gave them Languages. You argue more Congregations than one, from variety of Languages in <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> or else they could not perform their Duties to each. We may do the like against this Catholick Eldership here. If it had been only asserted, that every Man is an Elder of a Church, in the same Nation, then indeed such Elders might, in respect of Language, have been fit for their Office; but if you extend their Office to all the World, then it is impossible for them, to discharge it, when they are called to exercise it in any part of it, since they have not all Languages; and so are not capable of a call, to exercise their whole Function (as our Brethren say, their Right and Office is) in every part, or in the whole. But now when God made Officers of all Churches, he gave Gifts accordingly, Tongues, and Languages, as to the Apostles. Now we believe, that most Ruling Elders, have but one Language; yea, and if Latin, were the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Language, they were not fit to be Catholick Elders.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the Law of this Rule, if the Apostles should have met in a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, other Elders being also in that General Council, Catholick Elders, and being there, by vertue of being Catholick Elders, they must needs have been, in that respect, equal with the Apostles. For in that place, and in that Sphere, what could the Apostles challenge more of Authority amongst them, since to be a Catholick Elder, was the Highest Authority of an Apostle?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This principle is contradictory to other principles of our Presbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: For, whereas to rear up their Subordination of Assemblies, they invented a Representative Relation, personating many Churches, and also other Superior As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, such as National, and General Councils; this new taken up principle, of every Elder's being an Elder of the Universal Church, destroys it, or makes it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. It takes away all such Representations; for every Person, chosen to be of them, was already a Member really, and not Representatively of the whole, and hath a full Right of Eldership of the whole Church, according to this their Notion, and the special call, any one hath, is but <hi>Designatio personae, a Designation of the Person,</hi> who shall serve at such a time; but in that Council, when met, he Representeth the whole Church, as much as any particular Church, when he meeteth there. And to make him an Elder, representing any particular Church, is to give him a lower Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle than he had; for he is an Elder of the Universal. And his call only gives the <hi>Exercitium,</hi> the other gives the <hi>Jus,</hi> which is more than the <hi>Exercitium,</hi> for it is the root of it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It would make <hi>Bellarmin's</hi> Argument good, that the greater company of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders simply would have the greater Authority; for, it lying not in representation, but in being Elders of the Catholick Church, they must (though out of a Council) needs carry it, if more of them will agree to meet in a Body, at any time.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. If every Elder were thus an Elder of a Church Universal, then the Church Universal should call him to his Office; but the Church Universal doth not call him, but only particular Churches. For Church and Elder are Relatives, and the call is that which makes the Relation: And Jesus Christ calleth either mediately, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. Immediately, he indeed did call Apostles to be Officers of the Church Universal; but then himself did it, and gave Gifts accordingly fit for it. When he calleth mediately, there is a proportion between the means by which he calleth, and the thing whereto a Man is called; and therefore the proportion must lie in this, if he be a Member of the Church Universal, the Church Universal must be the means of his call; and if he be called by a particular Church, then his Office reacheth no further: We have an express Institution, that Elders were set over their particular Flocks, by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and when the Apostles themselves, who were General Officers of all Churches, did Ordain any Elder, it was but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, so that although the callers had an Universal power, which no Synod in the World hath the like; yet the Office of the called was limited, according to the Seat and Church, to which he was called: And if the Apostle did not make Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elders, who yet had an Universal Power, then surely a particular Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a general Elder, that exceeds its proportion; he is thereby limited both by
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:154381:81"/> the extent of the power of the callers, and the limits of the Seat, to which he is called: And indeed, the Nature of an Office, in the Church, is a Separation of him for a constant work; it is not to do here and there an act of Office, as a Journy-man, but to have a constant imployment, which Office therefore is limited to a certain Church, which Church also calleth him to a certain imployment there. And if it be said that a Corporation hath power to call a Man to be a Member of the Parliament, for the whole Kingdom. Yet there is a double difference in this. The Law faith not, that every Burgess is a Parliament Man, and a Burgess of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which is, that you would make to be the Law here. And then in the Second place, the whole <hi>Terminus,</hi> and <hi>Object</hi> of his call, is to be a Burgess in that case of the whole Kingdom; and the relation ceaseth, when the use and exercise ceaseth.</p>
                  <p>And if it be said, that every Member is a Member of the Church Universal; and therefore every Elder is an Elder of the Church Universal: The case is not the same: For the one is a meer communion by way of priviledge: The other is by way of Jurisdiction. And there is a great deal of difference, between a Man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free to Trade in all places, and in all Countries; and to have the power of a Senator, or a Constable, or a Noble-man, in all Countries where ever he comes. And sure our Brethren will not hold themselves to the parallel thereof, for 1. Tho' a Member of any other Church hath the priviledge to Receive the Sacrament, or have his Child Baptized; yet they would not allow him a capacity of being called (when he comes occasionally among them) to choose an Officer with them, or exercise such a priviledge over them, or with them. 2. If the proportion of Elder and Members be observed, then by this Rule, as any Member of another Church may, without any further special call, than barely a Testimony, that he is a member of another Church, challenge communion with any Church; (without any precedaneous active call of the Church intervening) so by the same Rule of proportion, if every Elder, were an Elder of the Church Universal, you need not say, if he be called by another Church, he may do thus or thus; but if it be made out by made out by Testimony, that he is an Elder of another Church, he may challenge the priviledge of an Elder, as the other may of a member. 3. As for the communion of members in other Churches, there needs not any special Association of Churches into a Presbytery, neither hath a member a further right or call, to receive in a Church within his Association, then in any other Church in the World. By like Reason, Associations should be as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less for these Universal Elders to exercise Government in, and if the proportion holds, then as the Elder or Elders of one Association is excluded from coming to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in a Neighbour Association: So members of another Association should be from communion in those Churches, which are not Associated with it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That which is the principle and foundation of Popery; and which if it prevail'd, and all the Churches challenge the right of it, would hinder further Reformation and Growth in the Truth; and would make all the Reformed Churches Schismaticks, and would justifie Nonresidency, and introduce a Foreign Ecclesiastical Government, in all States and Kingdoms, that cannot be Christ's Government: But such is this Catholick Political Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for Popery, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> lay this Foundation for the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. 1. That the Church Universal is a politick Body, and he quoteth the same Scripture, that our Brethren use to do. And 2. He saith therefore, it must have a Supream power, existing somewhere: For as there cannot be <hi>una res publica sine Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vili Suprema potestate,</hi> nor <hi>unus exercitus sine imperatore;</hi> so nor can there be <hi>Ecclesia politia una,</hi> without an External Supream power, suited thereunto. And if there be such a politick Body, see how easie a step it is, for the Pope's Monarchy in the third place: for if the Institution do fall first upon it, then there is reason supposed, that Christ hath ordered a constant existent Government; for the greatest Institution deserveth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Blessing; And he that gave Ordinances to every particular Church, Pastors and Teachers, would be sure to give them to the whole, considered as a politick Body. So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> argueth also, that if the particular Churches had not been united into one Body, one Pastor might suffice each; but if they be all united into one great Body, there must be (saith he) one external Pastor over the whole.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:154381:81"/> 2. To think that Jesus Christ should make an Institution of a Doctrinal principle only (which should not have existence) namely of this, that the Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal is a politick Body, only to set up pedling Presbyteries, by vertue of it, or Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Assemblies, when yet his Institution, is by that principle, supposed to fall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily, upon the Church Universal, is not likely.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The competition would be, whether a General Council should be the constant existent Government, or one Man. A General Council there never was yet, one that was truly General (as all acknowledge) but that some Churches have been left out, either those in the <hi>Indies</hi> or <hi>Gothland,</hi> or some-where else they have been still, as <hi>Chamier</hi> argues against the Pope: And if it could be, it could be but rarely; but Christ would have appointed his Government (if his prime Institution had fallen here) for one time, as well as for another. But now as when <hi>Moses</hi> was wanting, they set up a Calf, the Christian World, if this principle were true, would say, here is an Universal Church, but where is a Government extant?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And then if a General Council were extant, yet herein one Man may mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and it is not against the essence, or the constitution of Government, (as Presbyterial Divines acknowledge) that one Man should be a constant Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</p>
                  <p>And then 5. If that this General Council were Dissolved, at some time they might have the same power that a National Assembly useth to have in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to make a Committee of a company of a Head City, to be Commissioners till the Council meet again, and this would be a good standing conclave (such as is at <hi>Rome)</hi> for the whole Church.</p>
                  <p>And then 6. If you would help it out with the Law of Nature, as you use to do with this principle of the Universal Church, if the Institution be not very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, the Law of Nature will as well set up one Man, to whom Appeals may be made; and the Analogy of the Forms of Civil Governments and Monarchies of the World, which all the World runs after, will help to strengthen it.</p>
                  <p>And then 7. You shall have the Examples in the Old Testament (which also, in this case, you use to have Recourse to) to back it. There was a perpetual <hi>Synedrim,</hi> where there was a National Universal Church, and there was an High Priest, and if the High Priest were ceremonial, yet that one Man should be over the several Order of Priests, was according to the Law of Nations, whereby the Eldest, in a Tribe, was over the rest. And to have this one Man, and this Conclave to be peculiarly designed for the Church Universal, is more practicable: For if there were such an Institution, who would not rather think, that there should be one Man, or some Men, whose business should be set apart, to watch over all in common, with Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick promise made to them, than that those that have charges of their own little Congregations (which Congregations are to be the main of their care) should be all Catholick Elders? That other way the Church would be easily governed; for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Pastors would only have the care of particular Churches, and one Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, together with others singled out, should be appointed for nothing else but the publick: Whereas this principle would make it every Man's care, and so no Man's, or divide them between the general and their particular charges.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Then you would have all the inconveniencies of an Aristocracy, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of so great a Body, which will prove equal to those of a Monarchy: For first, all Heresies have ever been from the Clergy, and their Divisions. And secondly, the Church would ordinarily, this way, want a Supream Government, which the other way of one Man, would be constant in. And 3. Divisions would not so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be allayed. So as indeed, it is more Rational, (if this principle had been true, that the Great Body of the Church Universal should be a politick Body;) that Christ should have Instituted a constant Conclave for the Government of it, under some one Man.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, It would make the Clergy, the Catholick Church in the Creed; for to tell the Church, if it be a politick Body, is to tell these Elders which Represent the whole. Yea, by this you would make two Churches; one of the Elders, another of the Faithful: And if you distinguish it yet further, into the visible and invisible, you make three. And then as for that Catholick Church of the Elders, they would be a fit Body for the Pope presently to be the Head of them, and to step into the Throne; for the Pope, and the Popish Clergy, make that one Beast mentioned in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:154381:82"/> 2. This principle would hinder all Reformation, if Practised according to the Law of it; and prove all Reformed Churches Schismaticks: For if there were, <hi>de jure,</hi> a General Assembly of all <hi>Grecian, Egyptian, Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick, Persian</hi> Christians, and they would set down the Doctrine, which we shall all be confined to; and we should be, by the Law of the Universal Catholick politick Church, obliged to an uniformity with them, or with the greater part of them, as well as now we think our selves to be with the Reformed Churches: How would this set the Clock of Reformation back? And yet according to this principle, we are more bound to the Law of uniformity to this General Body, than we are to any particulars: For Institution doth fall first according to this Notion, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church Universal, and therefore the Law of it would oblige more: And so if we refuse to do this, we should make our selves Schismaticks, from the Great Ordinance and Institution of Christ. Yea, this must have been the Law of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Churches in all Ages, with respect to the Church Universal. For the Law is perpetual, and is at no time Dispensable; for Christ is with his own Ordinances, to the end of the World. If <hi>Luther</hi> had been bound up, by this Law, how had the Church been Reformed? We should not have gained that in seven Hundred years, that he did in Twenty. Yea, if this Synod had been so chosen by the Law of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Toe Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at</hi> Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> Universal Church, as to take in the Ministers of all <hi>England;</hi> so that the Law were to call all, one as well as another (for one and all are Ministers, as well as Churches) this would have spoil'd your Reformation. And besides, this would make us all Schismaticks, by our National Covenant; for if we were under the Law of the Church Universal, as a politick Body, we do make a Separation from this Law, by combining our selves only with Reformed Churches, that are so small and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable a part of the Church Universal.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It justifies Non-residency, or makes Non-residence, <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> for Ministers, being Elders of a Church Universal, by a prior Institution, can never be absent from their Flock. And every Man may pretend, for a more general Service of the whole, whereof he is a Member, that the lesser should give way. And this was the chief grounds for Non-residency, in the Bishop's times, that every Man was a Minister of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in general, and so he might serve the whole; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though he were a professor in the University, he was serving the whole Church, and so he might hold other livings too, and yet be absent from them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It layeth a Foundation of bringing in a Foreign Power, to bind, all or any of the Kingdoms in <hi>Europe.</hi> It will bind any, for the greater part of the Reformed Churches, if we should go no further, may challenge, by vertue of this ordinance and institution, that, what they agree upon, we all should receive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you will say still, that the Magistrate may still call those Universal Elders to meet in a Council, or not call them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. But still if this be an Ordinance, they are to call themselves: It is their Duty; They are to assume it, if the Magistrate should neglect. And</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. However when they are called, they may impose their Canons. And</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. The Magistrate is bound to be Subject, for they are Christians, and so <hi>Pars Ecclesiae,</hi> and so to be Subject to this Ordinance; for they have not a power to break the Ordinance of Christ: And they are not to Resist it, for there is a Law of Christ's Institution upon it. If it be but consultive to the Magistrate, then they say no more than we; if obligatory, then it bindeth, and then they must either take the Magistrates into the Council as Members also, which is the usual <hi>Salvo</hi> for it; and so they are parts of the Parliament and Common-wealth, which hinders the freeness of the Vote of the Ecclesiastick Persons; And then if the Major part which carry it be not the Magistrates, but Ministers, as usually they are; then the Magistrates, in their civil Assemblies, when they come to confirm it, are bound either to ratifie it, or not: If not, then the Authority of the Synod is but consultive to them: If they be bound, then this Synod is a Superiour power to the King and State; and this within their own Dominions, by vertue of this Catholick principle. And then, without their Dominions, the greater number of Churches
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:154381:82"/> will oblige both the one and the other, and is a power over Princes; yea, and a Foreign Power may be brought in hereby, and as well as by Popery, only with this difference (if you cut off Infallibility) that there is but one Man, the Pope, but here an Aristocracy of Divines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Any among us would not be more bound to the Elders of our own Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, then to the Bishops, and Elders of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, if there was to be found more of the Catholick Church, or a greater among them; for hereby I have as good a Warrant and Authority to cleave to them. Cohabitation doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me to my own Elders, when the Institution is Universal all the World over.</p>
                  <p>Those places that are ordinarily alledged, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. although they import communion amongst Churches, by vertue of that Catholick obligation; yet none of them hold forth, that <hi>that Catholick Church</hi> is a politick Body. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is said there, that God hath set up Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that Church; but it is as a Man may say, he hath set up Kings and Emperors in the World, it doth not therefore follow, that the whole World is one politick Body; and all the Kings and Emperors have an Authority over the Universe, but only partitive in their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dominions.</p>
                  <p>And the communion which the Members are obliged unto, and the bands and ties, there mentioned, are not only between the Saints and the Churches, and the Officers thereof now extant, and existing in the World, the Catholick State of the Church, in all Ages, is implyed, with whom we profess to hold a communion now, and we ought to do it, as well as with the Churches now extant. And that is clearly the Scope, in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. for he speaks of Prophets and Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers, that are given to build up the Churches in the Faith, untill the coming of Christ, every Age being knit unto another, by certain bands and tyes; and the Church in every Age, receiving a benefit by the Pastors and Teachers, and by the Prophets and Apostles, and their Writings in former Ages: And in all Ages, they have conspired so far, as to preserve Fundamental Truths. And from those places it may as well be argued, that Pastors and Teachers, and general Councils in former Ages, have a Juridical power upon all the Churches af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, as that the present Churches have, for he speaks both of the one, and the other, as one <hi>Totum complexum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> And if it be said, that the Apostles were Ministers of the Church Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, having Jurisdiction over the whole Universal Church; therefore once the whole Universal Church, was a politick Body in their time, and why not now: It is thus answered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Besides the difference of Apostles and other Elders, elsewhere spoken of, even to the Apostles themselves, all the Churches Universal did not make one poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Body, to be governed in common; but the Apostles still as they came to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Churches, had power in all those Churches severally apart; so as all those Churches are not called one Church, no, not in respect of the Apostle's Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But this opinion of the Universal Catholick Church, being a Body politick to all these Elders, would make it to be in order to a Combination under those El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as one whole politick Body, governed by them in common, and in, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Assemblies; whereas the Apostles, severally and apart, had, in all these Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the power still as they came occasionally: And therefore to assert, that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, having their particular Elderships, by whom they are governed, make up one Mystical Church, is in this to answer the pattern of the Apostle's Government it self; that as the whole Church then was not governed by the Apostles, as a whole Church, but only by parts; that is, the particular Churches by an Apostle, as he came into it, or as he had occasion to write to it; that so now this whole Church is also by parts governed, that is, the particular Churches are governed by their several Elders, having Jurisdiction therein, and therein only. And if unto Apostles themselves, this whole Church was not a politick Body, taken as one, then much less to Elders of particular Churches.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And also further, the meaning of that place, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. is not that every Elder hath an Authoritative politick Jurisdiction in all Churches, as occasion is, which is evident by this; because other particulars are there mentioned, as namely Ruling Elders, and Deacons (which our Brethren do understand by those words, Helps and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:154381:83"/> Governments, for so it is in the Original) so then they also should be Officers, as Deacons, and as Governours in all Churches also. And therefore his meaning is only this, it is as if it should be said, in a Common-wealth he hath set Noble-men and Judges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have the power in the whole, and every part of a Kingdom; and he hath set Justices of Peace, and Constables, and Headboroughs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it would not follow, that as the Noble-men and Judges have power in every part, so the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Justices of Peace, and every Constable or Headborough hath: And yet if from that place they would argue, that ordinary Elders have power in all Churches, as Elders, they must also acknowledge Deacons to have the like.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And that place in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. speaks of Pastors and Teachers, in respect of Doctrine, and therefore mentioneth only those that did labour in the Word and Doctrine, such as Prophets and Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers; and speaks of their being ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep that unity of the Faith; and therefore speaks only of their Doctrinal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, not of their Judicial power of acts of Government.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And it is farther to be considered, that when it is said, that he had set Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Church, he speaks not of Officers in the concrete, or of this and that Church, in this or that Age; but he speaks of Church, and of Officers in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract, he speaks of the kind; and so answerably we read, Eph. 4. 8. <hi>He gave Gifts to Men,</hi> that is, to such Officers in the Abstract.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The general Church receiveth Pastors and Teachers, but as formed up into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; therefore they are set in it only <hi>partitive;</hi> and though the Church is said to be the Subject in which they are set, yet not as a collective Body, and therefore they do not make up a general Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It may be objected, that the Apostles are said to be the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They are not set in it as a Collective Body, and if they were, yet as all Pastors cannot supply the Office of an Apostle, when met all together, so they are not set as Apostles, as the Apostles were. The Earls in a Kingdom are set otherwise in a Kingdom, than the Constables are; and therefore the meeting of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables in a Kingdom, cannot make up one Office of an Earl, or the Relation they have to the whole Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apostles were executively set in particular Churches only, and so the whole Church was not one Church, in Relation to them, nor did all Churches make up one Church, in relation to them for a Government.</p>
                  <p>Then 3. We acknowledge, that they may be all set in this Body as Apostles, and as Elders, and that by vertue of communion of Churches; and if you will keep it in that Mystical way, they are to be respected as Elders of such and such Churches, by all the Churches in the World.</p>
                  <p>As it is again objected out of those places, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. that the Gifts there, that are given to the Church, are not proper and peculiar to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It's true; but yet, though they are not given only to those that are elect in the issue, and in the event; yet they are given only to those that were visibly such unto Men, and to be taken for such; and such as, if we had lived in those times, would have been to be accounted Saints by us. All that are true Members of Churches, we are to look upon as elect, for they are elect to us; and therefore he Writes to the <hi>Church elect in Babylon.</hi> They are all Saints to us, and so they are visibly such, that make the visible Church. And that the visible Church there, though consisting of Men that in issue proved not the elect, is yet under the notion of such as are, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by this; that they are said to drink into one Spirit, that is, into the Holy Ghost, alluding to the Receiving of the Sacrament; because that none should be supposed to be of that Catholick visible Body, or of particular Bodies of Churches, but such as are supposed to partake of the Holy Ghost, as every True Saint doth. And the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into one Spirit there, cannot be meant of extraordinary Gifts, which may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be given to Reprobates, because the Spirit in extraordinary Gifts, is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Whereas it is said, that the Elders and the Officers, are given to the whole Universal Church; therefore that is a politick Body: I answer, that by the same reason, Mankind should be a politick Body also, for <hi>they</hi> are said to be given to Men, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. and the Gifts that are there said to be given to Men, are not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:154381:83"/> of the inherent Gifts or Qualifications, in respect of those Men they are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto (as the grace of an Apostleship to an Apostle) but it is meant of Men gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly put into Office, given unto other Men, or to Mankind; which appeareth by this, because they are given by conversion, before Men are of the Catholick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as well as for building up after they are in it.</p>
                  <p>It is again objected, that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. it is said, that <hi>the Members are to Honour one another, that there be no Schisms in the Body,</hi> ver. 25. <hi>if one Member suffer, all the Members suffer with it,</hi> ver. 26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> As there is a double Body of Church to Christ, the one Mystical, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instituted; so there is a double Union, the one Mystical, though external; and the other more special for Government and Jurisdiction. And the same things, that are spoken of the Duty of Members in a Body Instituted, that are a Body to Christ in particular, as the Apostle afterward distinguisheth, are due also to all Saints, by vertue of their Mystical Relation. And we find that the Apostles indeed, do argue the instance of the communion of the Body Catholick, which is between all Saints, to exemplifie and to illustrate the Duties that are to be between Saints, in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Body so joyned; yet by way of Similitude, but not oneness for kind. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause also all the Duties of Love, which, in particular Congregations, the Members are to perform one to another, are Duties by a Mystical Relation, as well as by that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial obligation: Yet they are bound to them by an obligation, beyond that of the Mystical Relation, which they bear to all Saints in the World. For though the Church Mystical Universal, affordeth matter for such an Instituted Congregational Church; yet that they should thus meet in Christ's Name, is a Superadded Form to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and lays a farther obligation upon the members.</p>

We can shew that the whole Nation, and Temple-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, was a Type of Congregations, and <hi>that Royal Nation</hi> (as that whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was then called) <hi>and the Holy Priesthood,</hi> is a Type of the Saints in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God at first Set up a Church-Government, suitable to that of a Kingdom, and suited unto the Government of the World; that policy is therefore called the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this World, unto which the Church in the New Testament, is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And then when there was a National Church, there was a Worship for the whole Nation, as a Nation to come unto; and so a Government in the place that God should choose for all to appeal unto; but there are no such orders now.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If the Institution do fall upon them, it must fall upon them either as they are a Church in a Kingdom, or as a Kingdom. But not as a Church in a Kingdom, for <hi>Qua</hi> Church, there is a greater Church out of that Kingdom, namely the Universal.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This opinion, tho' it seems indeed calculated to comply with Magistracy, for it divideth the independency of Government, according to the Division of the Supream
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:154381:84"/> power of Magistrates, and so would seem to fence them from any external power, from any other Kingdoms or Churches: Yet it makes the <hi>Church-power</hi> in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Independent upon that Magistrate, and <hi>that</hi> united into a greater Body, would be too hard for them, whereas the dispersing it, into particular Congregations, makes it easily wieldable.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth the Institution fall upon a conformity, either to the extent, or to the Government of Cities, as those who are for Episcopacy have intended, and some Presbyterial Divines also; and both upon the same grounds, although with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that the Bishops would have the Government of Churches, to be conformed to that of the Cities, taking in the Villages about them, and so to make a Diocess and a Diocesan Church; but those for the Presbytery, contract it to the extent of a City within it self, and so make a classical Church; the opinions of either, differing in this respect only, <hi>viz.</hi> the point of extent of larger and lesser Jurisdiction, the one confined within the City Walls, the other extending without.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because if it were so, then the conformity either must fall upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Cities, or the bounds of the place; that look what extent either the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or bounds of the Local Circuit of Cities have, the same extent should your classical Presbyteries have conformable thereunto; and in asserting either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable Absurdities, would follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To make the Government conformable to the Government of Cities, as their extent should fall out, is to make a warly Government, the pattern of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, is wholy to conform Spiritual Government, to the Government of the World; and then the same degrees of Officers of Superiority, and Inferiority, that is in Cities, should be in Ecclesiastical Government.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The conformity must rather fall upon the bounds of the Governments of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, than upon the circuit or material consideration; because that, which makes it a City, is the Government of it, whether the bounds of it be within the Walls, or other Towns about it, whether it extend to a larger circuit, or to a less.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It must either fall upon a City, as having many Congregations in it; and if so, it might as well have faln upon Villages in the Country, capable by Association to be many Churches as well, and the one would be as uncertain as the other; because there may be many Congregations in the one, as well as in the other. Or else 2. It must fall upon the Form of the Government of Cities. Or else 3. Upon Cities of such and such a circuit; and some Cities greater, and some lesser, that would be uncertain also; because some Cities are greater, and some lesser.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Foundation of this Assertion cannot be a conformity to the Government of the Cities amongst the <hi>Jews;</hi> for 1. The Villages, among the <hi>Jews,</hi> had a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in them, as well as the Cities. 2. Suppose that the Government of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in their Cities, was not conformed to the Government of the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Cities (which may well be supposed) for the Government of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to have whole Empires under the Government of a City; so <hi>Rome</hi> had, and then all the World under <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst it was a City Government, must have been one classical Church. or however, among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Cities were the Head of a whole Province, and of all the Villages under it, and it is so in many Cities at this Day; and that would make for a Diocesan Government, and not Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial.</p>
                  <p>If thus the bounds cannot be fixed, we are still to seek even in Cities, what should be the bounds, and are as uncertain, as in Villages. So as the conclusion is, the bounds according to this measure are uncertain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God doth not shape a Spiritual Government, unto the political? and the bounds thereof. Political Government, goes by the bounds of the Soil; so doth not the Spiritual. All that do live within such a place, or within such a Country, because they are of that Soil, fall under the same political Government; but there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that they should fall under the same Spiritual.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If the Frame of the Church were to be conformed to the City Government; then as the City did take in the <hi>Suburbian</hi> Towns, the Daughters round about, so the Church should not be confined only to the compass of the City, but extend to a whole Province: As the Bishops argue for a Diocesan Church.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:154381:84"/> 5. Christ's Government is suitable to all Ages, times and places; but now in all Ages and places, there is not the City Government; and there could not be the same Rule for the Government of Churches in Villages, and therefore it did not suit all places.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Jesus Christ's way is rather conformed to the Synagogue way; for so the Churches are called, and it is therefore conformed to the Government of the Synagogues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in Cities.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If this were the Ordinance of God, to conform Church Government to the Government of Cities, then all, in <hi>London,</hi> should make one Church, because it is but one City; and <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> if it were converted, would be so too, nay <hi>Rome</hi> it self (whereof the present <hi>Rome,</hi> is but the tenth part of what it was, as <hi>Cyprius</hi> shews) must have been but one Church, if they had been all converted; and there should have been but one classical Presbytery, to have Governed all the Churches there. Yea, in some places there are two Cities built together, that have the priviledges of Cities, as <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Galata, London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> the two <hi>Pragues;</hi> yea, <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had the City of <hi>David</hi> within it, and so there must have been two classical Presbyteries in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> from the first; For those of the City of <hi>David,</hi> might have challenged the priviledge of it, the Church had been conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a City Government; and perhaps that was the reason, why we read of two companies of the three and twenty Elders, that did sit in <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> because each Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had an Eldership of Twenty three, and so there being two Cities in that one, that of <hi>David,</hi> and the other of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> it self; there might be two Elderships, for those two Cities, besides there great <hi>Synedrim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. When Cities are decay'd and do lessen, and are brought low, it may be to as smal a number of Inhabitants, as Villages; yet they often retain their Priviledges as Cities, as many decayed Incorporations do. Now then if there were but one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation left in such a lessen'd City, it would claim by vertue of this City, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be intire within it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the Apostle hath said, in Tit. 1. <hi>Ordain Elders in every City,</hi> and that is parallel with that in Acts 14. <hi>They Ordain Elders in every Church,</hi> holding forth the pattern of a City, and the Government thereof for the bounds of it, to be set for that of a Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That place in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. in every Church hath Relation, as well to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in Villages, as in Cities; and so to Churches in those first times of the Gospel, that consisted of no more than might meet in one place; and therefore as well it may be interpreted, that there was but as many as would make but one Church in every City, as suiting the Phrase of his Direction, in Relation to what number of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were supposed to be in each City of <hi>Crete,</hi> when first <hi>Titus</hi> came thither in the beginning of the Gospel; and this number may well be supposed, to be no more than could make up one Congregation, and it was well if so too, no more than could make up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Ordinary Elders in every Church implies farther, that if there were more Churches to be in a City, that then he should ordain the Elders, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to every Church apart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. That it is so, appears; because as hath been shewn <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> City is meant, small Towns as well as Cities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. The Reason why his Direction runs to Ordain Elders in every City, was because though they did Preach the Gospel in Villages, yet principally in Cities at the first; because they were to leaven the Countries. And the Apostles, when they did Write to Churches in a Province, did use to Write to the Church of the Head City, as more eminent, not because that was either a Mother Church, as the Bishops say, or a classical Church of more Churches, as the Presbyterians say; but because it was more eminent, and from it the Epistle might be spread to others, as <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistle, to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> was ordered to be sent to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> which was in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, a less City than <hi>Colosse.</hi> And thus when they Write to the Churches of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia, Acts</hi> 15. they Write especially to <hi>Antioch.</hi> So when he would Write to all the Churches about <hi>Corinth,</hi> he nameth especially the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with them; and wrappeth up all the rest thus, <hi>and all that call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It was the Ordination of the Apostles in the Primitive Times, that all, in a City, should be one Church; both because the Distinction of Churches, and also their Names are taken from the City, as the Church of <hi>Ephesus, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore whether in one consideration or more, whether for the present, or for the time to come, the Saints, in such and such a City, were to be one Church; and a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church they could not be, therefore a distinction of a classical Church was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a Church in Cities. And the Elders had charge given them, to take care of that whole City, to convert them. And to this pattern of a City Government, were the Villages also to be conformed, several Villages making an Association into one Church, as those Cities did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. To the first part of the objection I answer, that they are called one Church in a City, and so distinguished; because there was but one Church for the present, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the Church existing at</hi> Antioch, that is, which at present was there. It doth not follow, that all the Churches, that should afterwards be there, should be but one Church. So as <hi>Bains</hi> saith, there is an Ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate acception of these Phrases, <hi>per accidens,</hi> not because the City and Church, was to make but one Church; but because the Christians by occasion of their number, not being then too great, were formed into one Church, not because there was to be but one. Now he, who thus useth them promiscuously, doth imply, that one Church was as yet constituted, not that there was to be but one, through the circuit of a City, Suburbs, and Country. Thus likewise it is easily answered, to the purpose of the Proposition; for thus the Multitude of Citizens converted, and unconverted, could not be a Church of one Congregation; yet the number of those, who in City, Suburbs, or Territories, were actually converted, was no more than might be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one Church; and the Apostles framing these into one, on the present occasion, did not exclude the after constituting of any other within the same local bounds. But if there had been more, there would have been other ways to have distinguished them: As when there were many Synagogues in a City, they were distinguished (for all the Synagogues could not have been called, by the Name of that one City; so nor the Congregations) and perhaps that was the reason, why that a School, which was a kind of a Synagogue, was for Distinction's sake, called the School of <hi>Tyrannus,</hi> as being the Ruler of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. If that were a Reason, then also the Name of a Village or smaller Town, as that of <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> would make as strong an Argument, that in every small Town, if there be a Church there, that it should be one intire Church (having the Government wholy in it self) as well as that many Congregations in a City, should become one Church for Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. The name of a Church, in a City, is not taken simply from the City, but from the People; as in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Smyrnians,</hi> and of the <hi>Laodiceans, &amp;c.</hi> Suppose they had removed (as in those times, thorough Persecution they often did) to some other City; they would have been the Church of the <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as well as the Church at <hi>Arnhem</hi> was called the <hi>English Church.</hi> So as the Name doth not refer simply to a City, and the bounds thereof. And when there was a Church of Strangers, of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> it is called the Church in their House; and so also when they were removed to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> it bore the same Name, to Distinguish it from the Church of the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> It is one exception against us, that when we say the bounds of a Church should be so many as can meet in one place, we hereby do fetch the constitution of a Church, from what is meerly exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and accidental to it; and the exception were true, if we fetch it from any one set or standing place, or House of meeting; but we fetch it from that which is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential to a Church, which is oneness of communion, in ordinances together, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one accord, as in the <hi>Acts,</hi> their meetings are characterized, which because it cannot be done, unless they do meet in some place or other, hence we so express it, not as that thing the Ordination is set upon, but as the necessary consequent or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct; but this exception made against us, falls fully and directly upon them, that would make a City the extent, either of the Local bounds, or the Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a pattern or measure of a classical Church, and the Institution of it.</p>
                  <p>If many Churches had been in one City, they might have been Distinguished by the Names of some of the Rulers, or as now they are by the Streets, or places of their constant meetings; for as if the Holy Ghost doth Write to the Angel of the Church
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:154381:85"/> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> as if the King doth Write to the City of <hi>London,</hi> he should intitle his Letter, to the Mayor and Aldermen, as Writing to the whole Corporation in their Names; so also might several Churches in Cities, have been as well Distinguished by the Names of their Rulers, and of their Elders and Pastors, as <hi>Tyrannus</hi> his School was. And there are other Reasons, why in that case the Names should be taken from the place; for cohabitation and dwelling together in a place, we acknowledge is a ground, why the Saints, so far as possibly they can, should meet in one Church-Fellowship, and not make several Fellowships. And we much rather think, that still the Denomination of one Church, in a City, did hold forth this Rule, that in all Cities, the Saints dwelling together; and so elsewhere, should make as big Churches as they could; to shew their Unity, and to make the Worship more Solemn, and to have more of the assistance of the Holy Ghost; and therefore they should not make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations, where there might be one only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. To the Second part of the Objection, concerning the conversion which the Elders are to take care of, I answer 1. To Preach is one thing, to censure is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And besides at that rate of arguing, all those, that a Man begets to Christ, hath therefore Authority over, to Rule them, to be their Minister. 2. The Elders, at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> indeed had a charge as Elders, by way of Government over the whole Flock, the Church that God Redeemed by his Blood; that is, of those that were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; and although that they were to endeavour to convert others (for how should the Gospel otherwise be propagated) yet if more had been converted, then there must have been Churches multiplyed; but still in the uniform frame, that this first Church was, having the same priviledges; and so to have New Elders placed over them, as over a New Flock. And besides, they are not called Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but Elders of the Church at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The care of Elders set in a City to convert, was to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as well to the Neighbour Villages, as to the Cities, especially then when they had gained as yet but few in a City: And then by this Reason, those in the Villages were obliged to be Associated with them, as well as those in a City, although all the City should also be converted, especially if those in the Villages were the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts; and this is one of the Episcopal grounds for a Diocesan Church; they in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect tell the same story, for the rearing up of Episcopal Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 5. To third part of the Objection, we Reply, that the way of constitution of Churches under the Gospel, being uniform according to Christ's institution, both in Villages and Cities, it is therefore squared, as well to the condition of the one, as the other: And therefore a Church, in a Village, may as well be made the pattern for the constituting of Churches in a City, as a Church in a City, for forming one in a Village. But Christ hath framed his institution so, as will serve both; and the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rules for both are the due bounds of a Church set (whereof there are many sure and certain characters in the word, from the Nature and thing it self) that so many as dwell together, that can conveniently meet in one place, should become one Church.</p>
                  <p>We grant (as <hi>Bains</hi> in the like case, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>Conclus.</hi> 2. concerning a <hi>Diocesan</hi> Church) that God might have made this pattern of City Government, an Ordinance of Church Government, as he did once take a Family Government under the Old Law, and made that a Church; and extended the bounds still by a Family, as they grew either greater or lesser: But as then, if a Man's Family had spread into many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, though he was the Priest of all these Families in publick Worship; because he was the Eldest of the Family, whilst he lived; yet that would not have been a binding Law to several other Families living together, that had not sprung one from another; that they should have come under the same Law of Association, that the others did. And therefore, though this were granted concerning Cities, it would not follow, that the Villages must be conformed thereunto.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>That the External Institutions of Christ, for the Government of his Saints under the New Testament, is not the same that was under the Law, nor can the Government of the</hi> Jewish <hi>Church, be made a certain Rule for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere are many things that were commanded to the <hi>Jews,</hi> which are obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to us Christians; tho' there are also many things which were Rules and Laws to them, which are not so to us. It will therefore be necessary, in stating the case first, to shew what is equally binding to us both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All such Duties as depend not upon Institution, but are Duties belonging to the First Commandment, as to Pray, to hear the Word, to give Thanks, must needs continue as well under the New Testament, as under the Old, and are the same.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such things as then had then a Morality in them, yet if the Morality was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by meer Institution, which depends upon the Will of God, (which Divines call Moral positions) even such Institutions, in their own individual Nature, cannot be urged upon us as Rules. As to instance in that of the Sabbath Day; if any should infer, that <hi>that Seventh Day</hi> should be the Sabbath Day under the New Testament, which was the <hi>Seventh</hi> after the Creation, would be a false Reasoning; although in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Institution of the Seventh Day, to be the Sabbath, was not Ceremonial meerly, but had a Morality in it; for it was from the Creation. The two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Circumcision and the Passover, had assuredly besides the Ceremonialness annexed to them, the Institution of Typifying of Christ to come (which Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision did by Blood, and being Administred the Eighth Day) these Sacraments sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Jesus Christ, the Substance of them must needs be Moral, and that by Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, as well as ours are now; as in 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2. <hi>They did all eat of the same Spiritual Meat</hi> (the same Spiritual <hi>Manna) and all Drank of the same Spiritual Drink.</hi> But yet it doth not follow, that the same Sacraments for Substance (cutting off the ceremonial part) should continue, but God was pleased to Institute other two in their rooms.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet whatsoever was Moral in the Substance of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Institution then, there is this equality, that Jesus Christ should Institute something in the room of it, in the New Testament. As for Example, because there was an High Priest; because there was an House of God then, the Apostle therefore argues, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 20. 21, to 26.) that we having an High Priest over the House of God, there is to be Assemblies to be now, as well as then: But as these Assemblies should be Formed up, and cast into the same Latitude and Extent, and the like, which their Assemblies had then; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a new Institution putteth the difference. They had National Assemblies then, not so now: The Priests were maintained by Tithes and Offerings then, the equity of this continueth, and the Apostle urgeth it in his Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> but yet it followeth not, that their Maintenance now should be the same way. And although there was a Moral equality in it, yet the Apostle Superaddeth, <hi>So I Ordain in all the Churches,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the Gospel hath once made an Institution in the Room of what was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law (as it hath done Baptism in stead of Circumcision tho' not exactly on the same Moral Ground; yet on the same Evangelical Ground, as Baptism was the Substance extant, under the Type of circumcision) this will warrant the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Baptism, unto like Infant Children now; when the Gospel it self also holds forth the same priviledge for Substance, unto such Children now, as it did then; and renews the same promise to them; tho' in an Evangelical way, far differing from that in the Old Testament, which contained a Typicalness in it. And this is not to raise up a New Institution, it is only the Application of an Institution to a Person; and that also when the Gospel holds forth the same ground which the Law did. But if any would reason, that because there was a circumcision under the Law, a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of initiation into the Church, therefore there must be the same under the Gospel, (if they cannot shew that Jesus hath appointed it, for the continuing of such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution)
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:154381:86"/> the Argument from the Old will not hold, or if they would argue, that it should be Administred in the same Latitude; or that the same Persons, who did Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister Circumcision under the Old Testament, may Administer Baptism now, we believe our Brethren will not concede to it, though the Argument will be as strong one way, as the other; for the Father of the Family might circumcise them, and did; but they would have only Ministers to Baptize now; and they too circumcised then in their Families, and did not bring their Children to the Temple.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Laws of the Old Testament, do help up to Regulate many Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the New, we acknowledge (as likewise the Laws of Nature do) but they will not be Warrant sufficient, to set up the like. So the Rules of the Judicial Law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the punishments of criminal Acts, that none should be condemned under two or three Witnesses, these Rules will serve unto, and perhaps ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by, every State (as some have held) to Regulate their proceedings against Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors: But yet unto <hi>Jewish</hi> policy (take it for the Government of it, and the ranks of Officers among them, and power they had) Nations are not bound so, as though the Rules of equity, whereby that policy did proceed, were perpetual, yet the question remains still of the power. That Ministers should be maintained, as they were then, the equity of the Law holds, but it will no way follow, that there should be the same Ranks of Ministers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the New Testament, intitles some of those Ordinances, that it self hath anew Instituted, with the same Names and Words used in the Old Testament, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues not that those Ordinances are to be framed and formed according to the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Old: But they have the same Names, because that the Old were Types of these. Thus that our Ordinances now are called Sacrifices: That Christ is called an High Priest: That the Officers of the Church are called a Presbytery: That Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is called a purging out the Old Leaven, and many such like, in the Evangelist; all this will not prove, that there should be Sacrifices, High Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under the New Testament. In the Evangelist, Christ speaking of the Teachers of the New Testament, saith, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 23. 34.) <hi>I will send you Wise Men, and Scribes,</hi> &amp;c, but yet it follows not, that the Orders of the Officers of the New Testament, should be answerable to the Wise Men, and the Scribes: So when a Believer, or a Church is called the Temple of God, when the Saints are called a Royal Nation, and the like; no inference can be made, that there should now be a Temple, and a National Church.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There were many things which are Moral now, that were not Moral then. To cast out of the Church for Moral sins, as such <hi>Qua</hi> Moral, is the Law of Christ now: But under the Old Law, they did not keep Men from Ordinances, for sins as Moral; but as having a ceremonial uncleanness annexed to them. No Man is to put his Wife away now, because she is a Heathen; but they were to put their Wives away then, if Heathens, after <hi>Moses</hi> his Law was setled. In destroying mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Idolatry, they were to be much stricter than we are bound to be, as Meats Sacrificed to Idols, they were in no place to eat thereof, <hi>Daniel</hi> refused the Kings Meat; but out of the Idol's Temple, we may eat things that have been Sacrificed to Idols, as the Apostle saith. They were to destroy all the Temples and Groves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but if places have been abused to Idolatry, we under the Gospel may make use of them. They were to destroy the <hi>Canaanites</hi> out of the Land, not we so now. They were to burn Idolater's Goods, as in <hi>Jericho,</hi> &amp;c. Not so now.</p>
                  <p>Having thus made way by these particulars premised, I shall now prove my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that the <hi>Jewish Economy,</hi> is no Pattern or Rule for Modelling the Church of Christ, under the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Priesthood being changed, there is a necessity of a change of the Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12. and so of the Law of the Government, which depends on Christ's Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office. We having a new High Priest over the House of God, we have a new Order in this House. For he is the Apostle and High Priest of our Profession, and it was meet it should appear, he was the new High Priest, by uttering the Institution for Worship and Government. So then that Old Law, which depended upon Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, as the High Priesthood it self did, is to be changed, and a new Law of Institutions, is to come in the room of it; and therefore in the <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Reformation,</hi> and the time of the Gospel is called, the time of Reformation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>Jewish</hi> Frame, and Form of Government, is called the Elements of the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:154381:87"/> World; and therefore both in <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. the Apostle bids us under the Gospel, not to be conformed neither for Worship nor Government (further than as Jesus Christ hath been pleased to take what was before, and make it anew) to the Elements of the World. So in <hi>Galat.</hi> 4. 2, 3. he saith, they were under Tutors and Governours, till they came to be of Man's Estate, or to be of Age; which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, they are in comparison. And indeed the Gospel being more spiritual the Frame of the Government, and Institutions of it, are not formed to a Worldly way to Governments of Nations, and of Kingdoms, as that was then, to an outward external Glory, as their Worship also was. As God hath chosen the Preaching of the Word, which is foolishness, so he hath chosen many of those things, which are vile and base, and contemptible, and a foolishness of Government, in comparison of what was then: And this is it deceiveth the World; for the Gospel is a Mystery throughout: He chooseth the Synagogue, and not the Temple; he chooseth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation and Eldership, and not the <hi>Synedrim;</hi> he chooseth Baptism, and not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Our Lord and Saviour, speaks altogether of a new Church to be made, a Church gathered in his Name, as when he Instituted Baptism, to shew that it was a new Ordinance; he bids them Baptize in his Name, so to shew that he erected a Frame of a New Church, he bids that it should be gathered in his Name.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Brethren's Principles, that hold the Universal Church, to be the Seat and Subject of Christ's Institution, argue this; for as his Church now over all Nations, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> is a differing Seat from that of the <hi>Jew</hi> only, so answerably, to set in his Church Apostles and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in stead of chief Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a new Institution; and it is certain▪ that that Church, whereof the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. is the Church of the New Testament: And therefore if the Church Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal being a politick, be argued from thence, it is by a new Institution, differing from the former; because the Church of the New Testament, which he speaks of there, began with the Apostles. And besides the Institution fell upon the Church of the <hi>Jews Qua National;</hi> but this falls upon the Church, <hi>Qua Ʋniversal,</hi> in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, else it would not extend to all Nations to be equal standers in it, whereas under the Law, they were not to be so with the <hi>Jews;</hi> but were to come under that National covenant, only when Proselited.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There seems to have been several forts of Policies and Orders extant, under the Old Testament, and unto which of these should the conformity now be made? By what rules should we now judge?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There were 1. Chief Rulers over several Bodies of the Priests and Levites: To which Government the Bishops say, their order is an Allusion. There was also a power in these Priests and Levites, proper and peculiar to them, to judge of the clean and unclean; and concerning the matters of Worship in the Temple. And this Government was purely Ecclesiastical; and unto this therefore, rather should the Analogy refer of matters in the Church, seeing that these were purely such.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, There were the civil Judicatures in their Cities and Towns, and in their great <hi>Synedrim</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for all controversies within their Gates, as the Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. Yet these were all Ecclesiastical, but indeed mixed both in respect of causes and persons; their Church and Commonwealth being so mixed, as it is hard to distinguish what belonged to them, meerly as a Commonwealth, and what belonged to them as a Church, in respect of what came under the cognizance and power of those Courts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then again, There was their Synagogical Government, which seems to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from what either the Priests had in the Temple, in respect of Persons clean and unclean ceremonially, or over one another; or from Courts of Judicature in their Gates. A Government those Synagogues had, for there are the Rulers of them mentioned; and also punishments they had, for when the <hi>Romans</hi> took away their Government in their Gates, they scourged in their Synagogues. There were Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions also, or Excommunications, or casting Men out of their Synagogues. The Great <hi>Synedrim,</hi> and their other Courts, did punish by civil mulcts, and the <hi>Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi> did put to Death: In the Temple, the Priests kept out the unclean; and the Judgment of that was not by the <hi>Synedrim,</hi> but by the Priests that did look to the Worship of the Temple: But the Synagogues did cast a Man out; and the Priests did not Supervize the Government of the Synagogues.</p>
                  <pb n="169" facs="tcp:154381:87"/>
                  <p> And that all this was a matter of a differing cognisance, from what was Transact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their other Courts, is evident by this, that for many sins (besides the civil punishments that were adjudged in the Courts of their Gates, as to restore and the like) a Man was further obliged to come to the Temple, with Confession, and with a Sacrifice; so as the charge of the things of the Temple, and the Order and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline thereof, was another thing than that of their civil Courts. And although a Man was cast out of the Synagogues, and was in respect of such a communion, as a Heathen and a Publican; yet he might still come to the Temple, and partake in the Worship thereof. But that the <hi>Synedrim</hi> did at any time pronounce that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that a Man should be as an Heathen or Publican, that this was proper to their Courts, we believe not. Now it is left very uncertain, to which of these the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the Government of a Gospel Church should be accomodated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> It is said, that our Saviour Christ, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. reflected upon some Bench or Court, the next then extant, to which the People were wont to resort among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so intimated, that his Will was, that the Church, under the Gospel, should be formed up conformably to us, and that so it should be like to that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and so the policy of the Church of the New Testament, should be conformed to the policy of the Old, by vertue of that first Institution, And from thence it is argued, that there should be Ruling Elders, that are not Teachers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there were such among the <hi>Jews:</hi> From thence it is argued, that there should be a National Church, a National <hi>Synedrim</hi> or Assembly, as was among the <hi>Jews:</hi> From thence it is argued, that the power is in the Elders alone, because it was so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are called the Church: And so this Analogy of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, is one of the great Foundations of the Presbyterian Government, and of Classical and National Assemblies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> But besides that, it was not necessary that Jesus Christ should allude to it, though he useth the same Phrase: The Deformity of that Pattern, and the policy of the Government of the New Testament is such, as that that cannot be Christ's intent.</p>
                  <p>For 1. If we take the <hi>Jewish</hi> Pattern, in matter of Government, we shall be worse put to it, to judge what is ceremonial, and what is perpetual, or what was a judicial Appendix to the ceremonial, and added upon a supposition of it, more than we are put to it to judge, what was ordinary, and what was extraordinary in the Apostle's practices. If that our Saviour Christ alluded to it in the gross, and in the lump, who shall be able to distinguish?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If that policy should thereby be Established, it would as well serve for the erecting of Episcopal Government over Ministers; for although it is said, that <hi>Aaron's</hi> High Priesthood was Christ's Type, and not the Type of Bishops; yet that the Priests <note place="margin">
                        <hi>These were called the chief Priests</hi> Mar. 2. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> Ch. 27. 1. Acts 19. 4.</note> and the Levites (several companies of them) should have one that was the chief overseer over all, who is by the Septuagint called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Bishop and Overseer was no way Typical. There were four sorts of <hi>Levites. Priests, Kohathites, Gershemites, Meca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, Numb.</hi> 3. 30, &amp; 35. And over each of those, were four Eminent persons, whereof <hi>Eleazar</hi> was one, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 32. And when <hi>Eleazar</hi> was made High Priest, then <hi>Phinehas</hi> was Governour of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and had oversight of them, Ruling of them, as a <hi>Chron</hi> 9. 20. And <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 33. <hi>Ithamar</hi> was over the Sons of <hi>Gershom</hi> and <hi>Merari.</hi> And in <hi>Neh.</hi> 11. 14, &amp; 22.

And for this, will the <hi>Jewish</hi> pattern and policy (if that were alluded to) serve as well as for the Presbyterian Government. And in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 8. we read of the three Rulers of the House of God, whereof but one was the High Priest: Now although that the High Priest, for his going into the Holy of Holies, was a Type of Christ, yet not all those other that were the Rulers of the Priests, and of the House of God.</p>
                  <p>And if it be replyed as it is by some, that this was but the Law of Nature, the Heads of these Familses being Rulers over the rest, it is answered.</p>

                     </gap>s for an Aristocratical, and so Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be argued to be suited to the Law of Nature, as well as to the <hi>Jewish.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. It belonged not to the ceremonial Law, but it served only for Order; and although the Eldest of the Family were those Governours that were set over the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:154381:88"/> rest of a company of Priests of the same Family, and so that the Eldest had it by Birth, and by the Law of Nature; yet that one should be set over the rest, was meerly a matter of Order, and therefore will plead for it self as strongly (if we take the <hi>Jewish</hi> Pattern) as for any other way of Government.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected, that upon this ground, that one Man makes not the Church, Episcopal Power is cut off, and that therefore the Allusion of our Lord Christ in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. is to those Courts that were erected among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In the first place, either there were two sorts of Courts, one civil, and the other purely Ecclesiastical, two kind of <hi>Synedrims,</hi> both in each City, and in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> which can never be proved: And if two, which of these two Christ should Allude to, will still be the question. Or if there were but one kind of Court, that was both for civil and ecclesiastical Government; then the <hi>Jewish</hi> Pattern will not serve the turn, for then, by that reason, Persons Ecclesiastical, now should deal in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil causes (for so they did then) and Persons civil, should deal in Ecclesiastical. Yea, and those that hold there were two Courts, the one for causes civil, the other for ecclesiastical; yet they say, the Persons in both were mixed. And because that both were thus mixed, therefore in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 9. speaking of the <hi>Synedrim,</hi> he saith, <hi>When thou shalt come to the Priest, or the Judges, which shall be in those Days,</hi> &amp;c. for sometime a Priest was the President of that Council, and sometimes a civil Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that was not of the Priest's Office, whom therefore he calleth a Judge. It was by Institution, that there should be some Priests, <hi>Ezek</hi> 44. 24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 8. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 18. And also that others then Priests and Levites, were of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrim,</hi> and also Judges of particular Cities, as all sides acknowledge. For from hence, all Presbyterian Divines argue, the Pattern of Lay-Elders, which yet, if there be not an Institution for it in the New Testament, would never be able to be argued from hence; and therefore many of our Brethren that acknowledge Persons civil, that were not Priests and Levites, to have been mingled in those Courts, yet deny the consequence of that Argument, unto Ruling Elders now; which if the <hi>Jewish</hi> Pattern had held, it would have argued it. And it appears further, that therefore the Elders and the Priests are mentioned. Pharisees that were not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> threw off their Rulers, and the Priest or the Judge, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and the Judges, Elders and Priests, are usually put together in their Cities and Courts.</p>
                  <p>And the Reason why both were mixed thus, to become but one Court, was because that then the Church was mingled with the Common-wealth, and both were but one; therefore the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> is called the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel:</hi> And the Laws of their Common-wealth, were given immediately by God; and therefore the <hi>Levites,</hi> as well as the civil Authority, were the Interpreters of that Law. If therefore this should now be the pattern, as when according to our Brethren's Assertion, the Church grows up to a Nation, there should be a National Church; because that was the Pattern of the <hi>Jews,</hi> so when the Churches grew up to a Nation, the Ecclesiastical State, and the civil, should become mingled, and Ministers should Judge in civil Causes, and those, that are not Ministers, should Judge in Ecclesiastical, for so in that <hi>Synedrim</hi> they did.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that all the Acts were not Church Acts, as sending Ambassadors, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Wars and the like: The answer is, that all such Acts as were towards other Nations, might not so properly be called Church Acts; but the question is, what was among themselves? And yet even their Wars were Holy, and their God was called the Lord of Hosts, and the Priests wait with Trumpets, to incourage the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to fight, as if it had been an Ecclesiastical business.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Again Secondly, if that be the Pattern that Christ alludeth to, then if that State had whilst it stood in the Apostle's times turned Christian, it might have been conformed to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Patern of Government, as it then stood; and so the Persons of the <hi>Synedrim,</hi> that were Judges of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Judges of the Christian Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If that the <hi>Jewish</hi> Government had been the Pattern, then there should be but two Courts Subordinate one to another; for so there was no more among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in a way of Subordination. There was the Court in each City and Town, consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some of more, some of less, according to their proportion and bigness, that did Judge of all causes within themselves; and then there was the great <hi>Synedrim,</hi> and Appeals were made immediately from each of the Inferior Courts, unto this Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. And whereas it is said by some, that there were three Courts at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:154381:88"/> for Appeals; we find not by the Scriptures, that there were three such Courts, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some of the <hi>Rabbins</hi> say there were. And when the Text saith, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. that whosoever would not obey the Sentence of the Judge, that should be in that place, should be put to Death; then when they brought it to the first Court, the Judges of the Twenty three at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> according to that Notion, they should have been put to Death, and never have come to the great <hi>Synedrim.</hi> And if there were two such Courts of the Twenty three, besides the <hi>Synedrim,</hi> yet they were not for Appeals; but they were either the one of that City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which as a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had the priviledge to have Judicature within it self, besides the <hi>Synedrim</hi> for the whole Nation; and the other of the Priests for the matters of the Temple (for the Temple was an inclosure) or else the one was for <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and the other for the City of <hi>David</hi> (each having the priviledge of a City, although in two places, as <hi>Westminster</hi> and <hi>London</hi> have) the one was at the Door of the Mountain of the Lord, the other at the Door of the Temple. If then the Form of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Government be the Pattern, then all those Subordinate Congregational, Classical, Provincial, and National Assemblies, they shall be cut off; for the <hi>Jewish</hi> Pattern will not suit these.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If that were the Pattern, then the National Assembly should be the Supream Judge; and there should be none above that: But our National Assemblies, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Divines, do place an Universal General Council, and make that to be the Supream; whereas the National <hi>Synedrim</hi> of the <hi>Jews, Qua</hi> National, was the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Court.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If that that be the Pattern, the matters brought to that <hi>Synedrim,</hi> so far as we have a Rule in the Word for it, were only matters that were too difficult; and when they were too difficult for those particular Courts in the Cities or Towns, they were brought to the General Assembly, Deut. 17. <hi>If a matter be too hard for thee,</hi> &amp;c: Even as the hard matters, which none could Determine but God, were brought to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Exod.</hi> 18. 21.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When the Inferior Court it self did find it to be too hard for them, it was not by way of Appeal, that they brought it to the Superiour, so in Deut. 17. <hi>If it be too hard for thee:</hi> So as it was not in the liberty of any Person to Appeal; but the Court finding themselves not able to decide the controversy, they were to carry it to the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrim</hi> (therefore the <hi>Rabbins</hi> say, that that place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. belongs only to a Rebellious Elder) And if so, then this place will not serve to have Ecclesiastical Courts for Appeals.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The <hi>Synedrim</hi> did only judge of the matter of the Law and Right in a Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way, in such and such a case; but it was still left, after their Sentence, unto the Inferiour Court to judge of the matter of fact, and to apply the Sentence: So as by this Rule, the greater Assemblies of Synods and Councils should not at all Excommunicate; but only Doctrinally deliver the Sentence, still leaving, to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, the Application of that Rule, by the Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in whose power alone it is. Therefore speaking to the Judges of the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Courts, he says, <hi>Thou shalt do according to the Sentence of the Law, which they shall teach thee, and according to the Judgments which they shall tell thee,</hi> Deut. 17. 10, 11.</p>

                  <p n="9">9. If Appeals were made, and things were carryed to the Higher Courts, from the lower; there was an High punishment for the neglecting of the Sentence (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing there were an Appeal) meerly because the Sentence of that Court was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. The Man was to be put to Death, although the matter wherein he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeyed, did deserve a lesser punishment. But in the Ecclesiastical Government, that Christ hath set up, there is no higher punishment than Excommunication, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to Satan, therefore this Pattern will not serve.</p>

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they were constant at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and had therefore a peculiar Title, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Elders of the People,</hi> whereas others were called Elders of the Cities. And so the pattern of Bishops, who were constant Officers for a National Church, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend wholy upon the publick (as the same Persons did always here in the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission) will much better suit the <hi>Jewish</hi> pattern.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. They had always a chief, whom they called the <hi>Nasi,</hi> or the Prince, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the first Court, wherein <hi>Moses</hi> was chief, and the number with him: Seventy one, and so it is too <hi>Eze.</hi> 8. 11. 70 Elders, in the midst of them, <hi>Jazanias</hi> as the Prince; and if the Jewish pattern should hold, there should be such now. Therefore in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. the Court, being Denominated from some one, is called the Priest or the Judge; and it would, according to that, much better suit <hi>Rome,</hi> than <hi>Zion,</hi> the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Government, than that of the Reformed Churches, it being a nearer pattern to have one <hi>Nasi,</hi> one Prince, one High Priest, with a constant number of Cardinals, in a place which they pretend the promise is made to. And accordingly <hi>Bellarmine</hi> urgeth it for the State of Antichrist, and with more reason and strength, and more likelihood, than for the Presbyterian pattern. For the High Priests were ordinarily over that <hi>Synedrim,</hi> so the <hi>Asmones</hi> in the time of the <hi>Machabees, Matth.</hi> 26. 5. 7. and <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 5. compared with, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 28.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. There was a peculiar place, which God did then Sanctifie at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> in which the Great <hi>Synedrim</hi> was always to sit: Therefore it is still said, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. Thou shalt go to the place that God shall choose, as well as that they should go to the Judge, or to the Priest; because it was God's promise to be in that place, and with the Court sitting there; and therefore also it is said, <hi>If they should not do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Sentence of the Priest, that standeth before the Lord.</hi> And if they shew us any one place that God hath so peculiarly Sanctified, and set up such a Court as the Papists would pretend to do, then it would be a pattern, or else not. But God hath not Sanctified any place now, therefore the pattern will not hold. It may much better, in a Type, be Transferred to the general Assembly in Heaven, even to which we under the Gospel are come, or to the General Judgment of the Great Day, when all causes shall be judged over again.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Neither were all causes Ecclesiastical, brought to this <hi>Synedrim;</hi> therefore it is said, <hi>Thou shalt bring all Causes within thy Gates,</hi> not all causes in God's House. Therefore the High Priest is said to be over the House of God, and the charge of that House belonged unto the Priests; and there were three Rulers over the House of God. Therefore to the <hi>Synedrim</hi> belonged Judicials, and such Ceremonials, as did not appertain to the Temple, as the cutting off of a Man, that had Leaven in his House, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. But yet the ceremonial belonged to the Temple, and the Priests themselves were Judges thereof. And the Order of Priests and Levites had a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar power to Judge of Leprosie, and of Persons that were unclean, and to keep them out of the Temple, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 10, 11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 23. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 11, 12, 13. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Priests of the Temple put out <hi>Ʋzziah,</hi> when he was struck with the Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie. So Christ answerably speaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 4. Go shew thy self to the Priest, saith Christ, to the Man that he cured of the Leprosie, that he might judge of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were whole or no. Neither were there any Persons that we read of, but those that were Priests, that were to do this. Yea, the Leprosie was so infectious, that there was no Warrant or Promise, that any that converst with, or came to a Leper should be kept from it, but only the Priest. And in <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 7. they were to keep the whole charge about the Tabernacle of the Congregation: And in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 27, they were to look to the Sabbath. Now it is evident, that others, besides the Priests, made up that Great Court at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. If that this were the pattern, then the Church in each Village or City, now should have an immediate and intire Government within themselves; and so it would suit the Congregational Government. For each Town in <hi>Judea</hi> had Elders in their Gates; in the smaller there were three to judge their causes, in the greater Cities there were Twenty three.</p>

The number of the Persons were all set, they were Seventy, So that in the conclusion, we may say as <hi>Paul</hi> of those of the Circumcision, and observing the Law that they themselves keep not the Law, so nor those that were the Analogy of the Jewish pattern, here being these so great, so essential, and many differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jewish and Presbyterial Government, so now for a National Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                  <p>And if it be said by them, we urge not the identity, that it should be the same: We reply 1. Why not the identity in things that were not ceremonial (for such they pretend to make a pattern) but matters of meer Order and Policy, fuited to them, as to a National Church, and that by God's Institution, If they make the Institution of God the pattern in one thing, why not in another? 2. If it be only a meer Analogy, they themselves might shew some other Warrant, first, for the like things Instituted anew, by Christ under the New Testament, which being so Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, do bear Analogy with what was under the Old. For otherwise it's left unto the pleasure of Man to take and refuse what he pleaseth, and set it up as <hi>Analagous</hi> to the Old; and so others may set up other things, and indeed pick another form of Government out of other things, that were <hi>Analagous</hi> to the Government of that pattern. As when they argue out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. that Christ Alludeth to the Courts that were then in <hi>Jury,</hi> where he saith, <hi>Go tell the Church,</hi> and urged the Analogy to hold in this; that as their Courts which were called <hi>Ecclesiae,</hi> were a Colledge of Elders and Judges, and that therefore, the Church, that Christ means un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament, must be a consistory of Elders, and National Assemblies (as the lesser and greater <hi>Synedrim</hi> was distinct, and apart from the People) we have just reason to reply, why should the Analogy hold in this only, unless the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament hold forth that the Assembly of a company of Elders, apart from the People, are called a Church? If that were first found, then indeed this Analogy might be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereunto; but to pick and choose out one piece of the Model, and leave out the rest, and to say that Christ intends this, rather than the rest, without a special Warrant of his so to do, but Humane and Arbitrary, under the colour of Divine Institution.</p>
                  <p>To us this is an infallible Rule, that where God hath applyed a Type, or any thing out of the Old Testament, to an Institution under the New, we should so far be led by it, as he hath in his or that particular applyed it; for otherwise the Analogy of those chief Priests, which are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Overseers, as the Septuagint rendreth it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 109, 8, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Zech.</hi> 11. 14, 22. would hold for the Order of Bishops, by way of Analogy, as strong as any Argument can be framed from the Analogy of their Courts, to the like Ecclesiastical now,</p>
                  <p>It is urged by some, that that which belonged to that Church, as a Church, is Moral in all Ages (as that which belongs to a Child, as he is <hi>Animal rationale,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a Man, though what agreeth to him as a Child, agrees not to all Men; but what agrees to a Child, as it is <hi>Animal rationale,</hi> is common to all Men) now this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, say they, did not belong to the Church as Jewish, and as in its Infant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in a Typical respect, but as a politick National Church,</p>
                  <p>We answer 1. That their being a National Church was in a typical respect; and therefore all their Laws, Ceremonial, Judicial, Moral, the Laws that were given the State, were given by God; <hi>Jus civile judaicum pars Theologiae fuit, The</hi> Jews <hi>Civil Law, was part of their Divinity.</hi> And therefore the Common-wealth of <hi>Israel</hi> is called the Church; and in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. <hi>Peter,</hi> speaking to the Saints, saith, applying the type, you are a Holy Nation, a Royal People, he speaks not to them, as they were a Nation under a Government, one National Church, although he Writes to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were Disperst over many Provinces, 1 Pet. 1. 1. <hi>Totus status illius populi fuit figuralis, Aquinas, prima secundae Quaest.</hi> 104. <hi>Art.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Yea, 2. That great <hi>Synedrim,</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> seems to have a typical Respect upon it, it being restrained to the place that God should choose, and was a type of the General Assembly in Heaven, or at the Day of Judgment; for to that Assembly, doth Christ seem to Allude, when he saith, they shall sit upon twelve Thrones, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel;</hi> and the great <hi>Synedrim,</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was only that Court that did Judge the twelve Tribes, and no other Court besides.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There was that peculiar ground of the <hi>Jews,</hi> being a National Church (which was the main ground, why God made them a National Church) as is compatible to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:154381:90"/> no Nation under Heaven; they were a National Church, not only as Men living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Government, and under the same Prince, and in the same Land, or of the same Language; but chiefly and principally, as they were the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> to whom the promises were made as to one common Father, whose Seed did grow up into a Nation, whom God did sever from all other Nations as such, and made a Nation of them, dwelling alone, so as they were not to Marry out of their own Nation. And herein <hi>Abraham</hi> was Christ's type, Jesus Christ being now the Father of all the Faithful in all Nations, who are become one Royal Nation unto him; but a Royal Nation Spiritually, and a Royal Kindred, although out of several Nations, but not as formed into a National Government. And when they did grow up into a Nation, then God gave them Laws for the Government of them as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God did Institute them to a National Church and Kingdom, and made a new Covenant with them, and gave them Laws. And if now under the Gospel, we should come to a National Church, and have a like Government, it may have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution under the New Testament, as that had then.</p>
                  <p>And there is likewise this difference between our Churches under the Gospel, and that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>prima notio,</hi> the first Notion of a Church fell upon them, as they were a Nation; but now doth not fall upon the Saints, as they are a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that sense that they were; but it falls either upon the Church Universal, which is the Church Mystical, or upon Congregational, but upon none <hi>Qua Nation,</hi> as it did upon them; and therefore their being a National Church, was a type of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, and not of this or that particular Nation, now <hi>Qua Nation;</hi> but we can shew too, that <hi>Qua Nation,</hi> they were the type of particular Churches and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There is a great Fallacy in this Argument. It is true, that that which agreeth to a Church, <hi>Qua talis as such,</hi> is in every Church that is such; and so what was in that Church as National, purely so considered, may be, and ought to be in any other Church that is National in a political respect, as whatsoever belongeth to a Man, <hi>Qua rationalis,</hi> belongeth to every Man: When therefore it is said, this Government did belong to it, <hi>Qua</hi> Church, so we deny it, for it belonged only to it, <hi>Qua</hi> National Church in the general, and hath many specifical differences annexed. There is a Church National, such indeed was the <hi>Jews;</hi> and there is a Church Congregational, and such are those under the New Testament; there is a Church Universal, which is the Church Mystical: But what belongs to the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and cast into a Kingdom, will not belong to the Church Universal, nor will it belong to the Church Congregational, for it belongs to it only as National; and so we might as well argue, that what belongs to one <hi>Species</hi> under a <hi>genus,</hi> belongs to the other <hi>Species,</hi> or that what belongs to a Man, <hi>Qua animal rationale,</hi> should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Beast, because he also is <hi>Animal.</hi> So that this remaineth first to be proved, that Jesus Christ hath made National Churches under the New Testament, to be poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Bodies; and then the Argument might have some shew in it, that what belongs to a Church, as a National Church, should belong to a National Church under the New Testament, for matter of Government. But otherwise it may as well be argued, that what Form of Government agrees to a Kingdom, as a Body politick, must be found in every Corporation; and that the same Government must be in the one, that is in the other (whereas a Body politick is the <hi>genus,</hi> as also <hi>Church</hi> is, and National, Presbyterial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but Specifical differences annexed) and also that what belongs to the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> as an Aristocratical Common-wealth, must belong to all Common-wealths, whereas there are Common-wealths that are Monarchical, which we call Kingdoms, others that are Democratical, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the one, with these differences, belongs not to the other. What belongs simply to a Monarchy, as a Monarchical Common-wealth, must not be said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to a Democratical Common-wealth. In a Monarchy, there are differing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Marquesses, and Earls, and Lords; it will not therefore follow, that in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy, or in a Common-wealth, whose Government is by several Hance Towns, there should be the same too.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And if Christ had appointed National Churches under the New Testament in a political Respect, it was not necessary that the Analogy of the Jewish Government should be observed; no more than that, in every Kingdom and Common-wealth, the Analogy of the <hi>Jews</hi> political Government should also be observed. And the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:154381:90"/> too, might be kept and observed in its proportion, in every Congregational Church, as the Analogy of the three Estates, in the Superiour Court in Parliament, is shadowed out in many Corporations, where there is the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Council; but it is not necessary, that there should be the same Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Courts, all keeping the same Analogy as was amongst the <hi>Jews:</hi> For Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es depending immediately upon the Magistrates, in every Kingdom, might be well governed, as we see the Church in <hi>Geneva</hi> is and the <hi>Helvetians</hi> are. But we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Whereas the Argument runs, that that Government was not ceremonial, suppose that their having such a Form of Government with Courts of Appeals, having Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature in them, were not typical and ceremonial, yet it will not follow, that the like must be in the Churches in Nations, under the Gospel: Therefore <hi>Gersom Bucerus</hi> Distinguisheth, that some things were meerly ceremonial; and they were <note place="margin">
                        <hi>De guber. Eccl. p.</hi> 51</note> cut off, other things were perpetually Moral, and other things, though they were not ceremonial, yet they did peculiarly serve to the conservation of that policy, and were annexed for order's sake, to the preservation of what was ceremonial. Now that National <hi>Synedrim,</hi> was of that latter sort; for suppose it were not ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial altogether; yet that Church being constituted a National Church, as a politick Body Ecclesiastical, it must have a National <hi>Synedrim,</hi> that was suitable and answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For if we suppose a National Church, it must have a National Government proportionable to it, and Officers accordingly: And so that there should be those Heads of the Priests, and that imparity accordingly amongst the Priests, was a thing proper to the policy of the <hi>Levites,</hi> and yet not typical; for multitudes of them meeting in their ranks and courses, for the Service of the Temple, it was necessary that there should be one that should order those Multitudes of them, that in their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses came up.</p>
                  <p>It must be acknowledged, that what ever constitution of Churches as politick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Jesus Christ hath made, he hath took a suitable order, for the preservation of order among them: So having made congregational Churches those politick Bodies, he hath taken order for the Government of them as such. And if he had made Churches National, as politick Bodies; he would have took suitable order for them also, as he did among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and he would have done it afore such time, as Churches were multiplyed, so as to come up to a Nation; for so he did with the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> afore they came into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but so he hath not done in the New Testament, nor did the Apostles live to see it setled; and it were strange that that Form should be erected by Christ, that the Apostles lived not to see.</p>
                  <p>So that the conclusion of all, it must be this, that Jesus Christ did still suit the Government of his Church, to the condition of the matter, thus the Church, when in Families, had a Family Government; and when a Nation was singled out and chosen, it had a National Government; but the Saints being to be disperst over all Nations (as the <hi>Jews</hi> themselves were, when they had their Synagogues disperst) he hath Established a Government answerable.</p>
                  <p>A Church is said to be National, either 1. In respect of the Members, that all, that are of the Nation, are Members of the Church, which was the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jewish Church: Or 2. In respect of Government, that because they are a Nation, they are cast therefore into a National Government. Now indeed, the National Government of the <hi>Jews</hi> did follow upon their National constitution of Members; and answerably under the Gospel, even in Nations, the Government of Christ's Church doth follow the condition of the Members. Now the condition of those that are Saints (which are only fit to be Members of Churches) is to be scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down, and to be few; for they are Redeemed out of Nations: There are few Cities in <hi>England</hi> will afford more Saints, than will make one Church, but <hi>London.</hi> So as the reason, why, that under the Gospel, there is not this National Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for Churches, is because a Nation comes not up to Christ's terms, and if it should, there are other respects that make the alteration; for it was fit that the Body of the Saints, the People, should have interest of presence, and of a virtual concurrence, and of edification; yea, of suffrage in the Government. It was for the Honour of the Saints, that are come out of their Nonage, that it should be so, and that Worship and Government, and communion in both, should be commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; God loving more the Spiritual communion, that Saints have in publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:154381:91"/> under the Gospel, than the National Sacrifices under the old Law; and did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cast the Government under the Gospel thus, to attain this end, without which, it could not be attained; and also, because that Churches, as Churches, would be more sweetly ordered by the Law of communion of Churches without Jurisdiction, than by a Jurisdiction placed in combination of many Churches over each, seeing that Government could not be transacted in the presence of the Saints, but by dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated Messengers, and Representative Elders.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>THough those, who have stood up and Written for the Presbyterial Government, (as it is practised in the Reformed Churches) do assert it to be the only ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry standing, and perpetual Government, which ought to be embraced in all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Christian States; yet the Wisdom of the Assembly of Divines, at <hi>Westminster,</hi> thought meet to propound it to this Debate, that the Scripture holds forth <hi>it may be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas when the asserting the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of it is waved, that <hi>yet it is a Government the nearest, and in a Conspicuous Eminency, most conformed to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rules and Examples in the New Testament,</hi> is a position in Succession, the next, though a far lower step than the former. And less could not have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have been held forth, when all other Governments are laid aside, to give room for its Entertainment. Yet this first and leading proposition, to all the other that follow about it, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Scripture intimates, that such a Government <hi>may be,</hi> falls as low in its undertaking, as any Government that can be supposed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the least for it self. And in the like manner, the rest of the Propositions, that follow, run but in the same Stile, <hi>that it is lawful and agreeable to the Word,</hi> that things should be ordered thus or thus.</p>
                  <p>Though the Reverend Assembly would not venture so far, yet the next fairest way, left for Deciding this controvesie, had been to have patterned the practices and directions, which the several ways of Church Government pretend to, for their Warrant; and to have compared these, each with the other, and by an Harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Draught and Platform of either, when set together, it would easily have been discerned, not only which of them <hi>May be,</hi> but which of them <hi>rather should be;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> of the two which appeared to hold the greatest likeness, to the Primitive picture, drawn in the Stories of the New Testament, and in the Rules and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the Epistles, simular unto, let that have been esteemed the True Child there. But the proposition is so cast, that we must directly oppose it with such grounds, as may shew, that this Presbyterian may not be, without troubling our selves to consider, which of the Forms of Government this should be.</p>
                  <p>The Proposition as thus stated for the Dispute, upon a meer, <hi>It may be,</hi> as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the greatest Latitude and compass to the affirmers of it, for their way of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it; and paves the way for passableness with all Men, of all sides whatever, whose Judgments are not bound up with the opinion of a <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> in Church-Government, so it did put the greatest difficulty, upon those that were negative in Judgment to disprove it. The Difficulty lay in this, that the most direct and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al way, to overthrow the Proposition, is First, to prove and make good this other more general Assertion, so much controverted; <hi>That there is a certain standing or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Term of Church Government, held forth in the Directions given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, or the Examples of those Churches we read of in the Scripture, erected by their guidance;</hi> and that also seconded by this Negative, <hi>That there ought to be no other, than what is by Institution.</hi> Which two General Principles, if supposed or gained, then indeed this alone had been Argument sufficient to Disprove the Presbyterial Government, that if it be not held forth in the Scriptures, as the ordinary standing Government for the Churches, that then it may not be. These afore said General Propositions having been Determined, there needed no more words, to have been on
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:154381:91"/> the Opponent's part, but to examine the Assemblies proofs, whether therein there appeared this standing Government Instituted. But the Discussion of the General Propositions, was denyed by the Assembly (in the very first entrance into the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of Discipline) to be so much as Debated; and therefore could not be assumed here, nor any where else into any Debate, but against the former Order of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, so that they stood upon this Advantage, to maintain their Assertion upon <hi>Erastian</hi> Principles, and yet left us to disprove it upon the contrary Principles, which yet are common to them and us, and which (as one said, when it was laid aside) would require a quarter of a years Debate, and also would have been left wholly upon us to make good, although it be laid as the Foundation, by the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other Reformed Churches of the Pesbyterial Government, and made use of against the <hi>Episcopal,</hi> to prove that the Government of the Church by Bishops, may not be.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it may be said, that yet this was left us, that by proving <hi>the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way, to be by Institution,</hi> we might by that, as another <hi>Medium,</hi> have shewed that the Presbyterial Government <hi>may not be:</hi> We were in this Disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged also (if we would have introduced the Debate thereof, as against the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) that though we had never so sufficiently proved <hi>all,</hi> (that is, a compleat) <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)</hi> to be in a Congregation, by Christ's Institution (and yet for this Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of that, (as our Brethren full well know) it had been necessary to debate and discuss at large, first, that forementioned Principle, by what ways the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christ in the New Testament are held forth, whether in ordinary Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Practices of the Primitive Churches) yet that had been (as to our Brethren) an insufficient Argument to disprove this Proposition, that therefore a Presbyterial Government over many Congregations, may not be. And the consequence would have been denyed by many of our Brethren, that hold <hi>all power of Government, to be in a Congregation,</hi> but not solely or only; and so a classical Government over many Congregations, may yet be. And therefore, to have overthrown their Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there were two Propositions yet more necessary to have been proved by us, or the proof had not been sufficient as to them: First, that an Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not be set up (unless Warranted by Institution) over many Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that have it by Institution within themselves: Or Secondly, that the Scriptures do not hold forth by Institution, an Ecclesiastical Government in classes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> over many Congregations. One of these, or both, must have been proved by us. If the first, we should fall again into a new General Head about Institutions, Namely, <hi>That what in Church-Government is not by Institution, may not be.</hi> The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we also saw, the Assembly did Decline, and stated their Assertion upon an, <hi>It may be.</hi> And then again, this latter also being a Negative, the Demonstration lies not in positive Arguments to the contrary; but in a Defensive Denyal, with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the Arguments which might be brought to prove the Affirmative. And our Brethren not undertaking to prove an Institution of the Presbyterial Government, all our answers to their Arguments, had answerably still fallen short of disproving the Institution of that Government. So that our Attempt this way, to oppose their Prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osition, would have been unavailble, and in vain.</p>
                  <p>But this was not all the obstruction that lay in our way, to the confuting this Proposition, in respect of this their stating it upon an, <hi>It may be;</hi> but the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was increased further also, and yet no less from the vast indefiniteness, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate Ambiguity and uncertainty of that other Term <hi>[Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, over many Congregations]</hi> which importing an Association of the Elders of many Congregations for Government, doth admit many Variations, and includes in it several patterns of Government, and also differing Constitutions of those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. For, (to give an Instance) there might be conceived, a Twofold Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery or Association of Elders, over many Congregations. There might be one <hi>for the Ordinary and Standing Government</hi> thereof, so as the greatest matters apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to any of those Congregations, should be in a constant way brought before their Consistory, as belonging to their Jurisdiction: So as the Congregations and their several Elderships should not proceed, but as first Warranted by the Sentence of the Higher Presbytery. And there might be another Presbytery or meeting of Elders (and the Assembly had not declared any difference between Synodical and Presbyterial Assemblies set for a standing Government) but only in case that Schisms
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:154381:92"/> and Contentions fall out in the several Congregations, either about matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Government, or for Difficult cases, which the several Elderships of the Congregations, do find too hard for them, and so seek their help and direction: Or otherwise when the Eldership of a particular Congregation, hath Scandalously managed their Government, or wrongfully Excommunicated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Elderships offended, or appealed unto by the Persons offended, are to Judge and Determine of it. This is the first and most General Division of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Government, into which (as 'tis propounded in the <hi>[May be]</hi> it can be cast. If it be limited to an ordinary and standing Government, yet still as great an Ambiguity▪ as the former, remains touching the several ways, sorts or kinds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which this Presbyterial Government, and the constitution of these Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be, and are cast in the Reformed Churches, arising from a differing Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Elders (that thus are to make a common standing Presbytery) do bear unto these Congregations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The one is common and promiscuous, unfixed for all sorts of Duties, of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as for Ruling: That as in common, they make one Presbytery over them all for Government; so likewise they all are alike Elders and Pastors to each Congregation, and do bestow like pains and care for all Pastoral Duties of Preaching, Feeding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their courses and rounds, as is practised in some Cities in <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Second variety is, that they are a Presbytery unto all in common, for Acts of Discipline; yet they are Pastors or Elders fixed in their Relations properly, but to one Congregation, to perform all such Duties thereunto, and not unto the rest.</p>
                  <p>In the first, the Ministers of all these Congregations do, in a circular way, Preach to them all in their course, as well as they do Rule in common; as if three or four Parishes be together, the Ministers of each should in their turns feed them all, and the People partake of the Gifts and Graces of all, as well as the Ministers Rule all. Now if these Congregations, for the number of the Persons belonging to them, consist only of so many as can at times meet altogether, with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Elderships for matters of Discipline, choice of Ministers, Admonitions and Excommunications, and can be all present upon such Great and Solemn Acts of Government, in which we conceive all are interested, so to joyn in them, and to be edified by them; although in respect of convenience, they make several Set and Fixed Congregations for Worship, either on the account of Persecution, or of Distance from each other, or the like: And if they are so few Congregations, and so near as that Elders, that make up an Eldership in common, can fulfil the Duties of the Relation of Pastors to them all, in their round and course; so as those Congregations, do partake of the Gifts and Graces of them all, as well as are Ruled by them all; this kind of Presbytery of Elders in common over such a number, as can, and do, for their great Acts of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, meet in one Assembly upon such occasions, both People and Elders alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, make up one kind of Government and constitution of Congregations. But when there are Presbyteries that either through their extent and compass of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and distance of the Congregations under them, or otherwise by the Law of their Combination, neither do nor can hold the Relation, nor discharge the Duties of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors in common unto them, but do only and meerly rule them (and so do in respect to this, make a greater Presbytery over their many lesser Congregations, and this for the ordinary Government of them) and when the Members of these Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions cannot meet to be present at the Acts of Discipline (wherein they have an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of presence and edification) This is a second sort of Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and which is generally practised in the Reformed Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And again yet further, this latter may also be (in Rational Supposition) cast into two sorts of Government.</p>
                  <p>The first sort of Government is, wherein the Elders of these many Congregations, have no share of Government in publick Admonitions or Censures, nor bear no Rule in those Congregations, they are respectively affixt to; but such as under the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, the Pastors of the Congregations had, of preaching, private Watching, visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sick: All Suspensions from the Sacrament, publick Admonitions, Censures, being immediately to be brought to the common presbytery of Elders, set over them all for Government.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:154381:92"/> 2. Another Form of Government, is, that many Congregations (as in <hi>Scotland)</hi> having their proper and peculiar pastors and Elders, hereby come to be so many form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and distinct Churches; for the Relation of a pastor and other Elders, or Rulers, cannot but be unto a Church, properly so called; for Church and Elders are Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as Rulers and a Common-wealth. And therefore they are called <hi>Ecclesiae primae,</hi> as those to whom the Notion and true Nature and State of a Church doth first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. And further, these Officers of pastors and Teachers, being first in these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Churches, and there being in each, some competent number of Elders or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as a Pastor or Teacher, with other Ruling Elders (for otherwise the greater Presbytery should not be made up compleat, of some of all these sorts of Officers out of each Church, since the first Seat of all these Officers, is some particular Church) these pastors and Ruling Elders, do make up a Presbytery over each of these Churches respectively. And further, being thus particular Churches, or having a presbytery or Eldership, they have some, yea, and a great part of Government al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to them within their several Churches, as Suspension from the Sacrament, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Admonitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For to suppose them Churches, and to have Elderships over them, and to have no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of governing, would be to make an empty Title, without any of those things the Scripture gives to the Churches and their Elderships. There is only this difference, that when it comes to the great matters of Ordination or Excommunication, these are taken up to the great Presbytery. And thus within the Territory of this pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Government, intended in the proposition, two sorts of Elderships are to be understood▪ as included lesser, and greater ones over them, and two sorts of Churches (though called only Congregations) Churches lesser, and incompleat joyned to make one Church, as the Subject of the common presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>In these unlimited and incomprehensive Senses, was this proposition (the first Born of all that follow about this Government) propounded to the debate, although we urged upon the Assembly, that they would specifie and determine, which of these Governments they intended, and would maintain, but it would not be granted, nor any thing added for the limitation thereof; as <hi>[must be]</hi> nor <hi>[rather be]</hi> in stead of <hi>[it may be]</hi> not <hi>[over many Churches]</hi> in stead [of <hi>many Congregations.]</hi> The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of which, on their part, was a liberty to defend it in any of these Senses, and each upon the lowest Terms <hi>[it may be]</hi> for the proposition might vary, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with any of these shapes, for its defence, as if a standing Government, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately over many Congregations, could not be defended; then extraordinary and mediate of Elders Associated in Synods might: If the common standing Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fixed Elders, to their several Congregations, would not abide the touch, then still the proposition (they might say) is not confuted; for presbytery of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous unfixt Elders might notwithstanding be true, and so the Truth of the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would stand.</p>
                  <p>Being reduced to this narrowness in the entrance into the Debate, both for the state of the question, and for the Medium of arguing, We (1.) Profess to lay our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments against that way of Presbyterial Government, over many Congregations, as it is extant, or practised in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> over many Congregations, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Elders fixed to them: And we did also desire, that no other answers might be given; but such as they would in rearing up the presbyterial Government, reduce to practice. And 2. For the Medium of Arguing, we had little else left us, to have in a direct and open way recourse unto; but those Exhortations and charges given to Elders in the Epistles of the Apostles, as lying apparently cross to this way of pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Government, as thwarting the Rule of Christ, and Directions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
                  <p>The State of the Question then is this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Government is meant, a standing ordinary and constant Government, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised over many Congregations, in all the matters of greatest Moment, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any Persons therein.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These Congregations are such, and so constituted, as to have severally or apart, each their proper Elders affixed to them, to preach to them, and watch over them; and to be interested in lesser cases of Government, as Admonition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:154381:93"/> 3. But it is questioned, whether for all cases of Government that are the greater, as Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that shall fall out in any of those Congregations, those Elders in common, meeting in one great Presbytery or Eldership, and made up of them all (even as for lesser matters, the Elders of particular Congregations meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are lesser Presbyteries to their several Congregations Respectively) should not appropriate this greater Government to themselves, which we deny, and shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to refute in the following chapter.</p>

               <div n="5" type="chapter">

                  <argument>
                     <p>That if a Presbytery of Elders be erected, having po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> over many Congregations, besides their General Relation, they would also bear a particular Relation to each Congregation.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THat no company of Elders Assembled together, hath a Power and Rule over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations, will appear, if we do but consider what the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declares concerning Elders in their Relations to their Flocks committed to them; and concerning the Exhortations and charges to them, of Duties towards those Flocks, founded upon that Relation; as also the Duties of their Flocks to them, all which is like to be the surest measure to find out the extent of their power, and bounds of their Flocks, and whether that power for the ordinary way, be limited to one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation or many. For those Exhortations and Charges, must needs be supposed, suited to that boundary of Churches, and that constitution and extent of Relation, that the Elders of those Primitive times were placed in over them: Like as in the question about <hi>Polygamy,</hi> what the Scripture hath said of the Duties between Man and Wife, which were given and suited to the extent of that Relation, as God from the beginning bounded it; manifestly evinceth, that one Man cannot have many Wives, but one.</p>
                  <p>We have hitherto taken this for an undoubted Maxim; that as a Mutual Relation, is the ordinary Foundation of all power, whether Oeconomical, Civil, or Ecclesiastical; so the extent of all power, is commensurable with the extent of that Relation. A Master, as a Master, hath power but over such Servants, of whom he may say, I am your Master, and they of him, we are your Servants; for what hath any Man to do to Judge another Mans Servant? As the Apostle speaks. And the same is true correspondently here; those Elders that assume to be over either one or many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, must have, as the Office of Elders, so the Relation of Elders unto that one, or those many Congregations; that they may be able to say, we are your El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and you all are our Church; which two are in Scripture expression, the <hi>Relate</hi> and the <hi>Correlate,</hi> as King and Kingdom, Magistrates and Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>Now against this standing Government of these Elders in greater Presbyteries (as the Question hath been stated) We shall Humbly make use of the forementioned Maxim, for a <hi>Medium</hi> to overthrow this Government, by presenting together there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, the Incongruities and Inconsistencies of it, and also by Arguing what the New Testament speaks of the Elders and their Duties, in relation to the Flocks committed to them; which all do argue, that according to the Scriptures, such a Government <hi>May not be.</hi> And we frame our Argument thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If many Congregations, having all Elders already affixed Respectively unto them, may be under such a standing Presbyterial Government: Then all those Elders, must also (according to the Scriptures) sustain a special Relation of ordinary and standing Elders to all the People of those Congregations, as one Church their Flock, and to every one as a Member thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But for a company of such Elders already affixed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to sustain such a Relation, carries with it so great and manifold Incongruities and Inconsistences, with what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks of Elders, in their Relation to a Flock or Church committed to them; and likewise with the Principles of the Reformed Churches themselves, as cannot be admitted, and therefore such a Government may not be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That according to the Scriptures, such a standing Presbyterial Government, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily draws such a standing special Relation, we endeavour to evince by parts, thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:154381:93"/> 1. They must have the Relation of Elders, for Church and Elders are Relatives. And the Argument, for the Presbyterial Government, is taken by the Presbyterial Divine from this; <hi>That many Congregations</hi> in Scripture, are made <hi>one Church,</hi> and the Elders thereof Elders of that Church. This we had the greatest reason to take for granted, from the former Writings and Expressions of the Presbyterial Divines: Yea, the main Arguments, by which themselves have proved this Government, have been taken from this; that many Congregations, in the New Testament, do make one Church, and the Elders thereof, Elders of that one Church; and therefore are to govern that Church. And this we have the greatest reason to take for granted still, for in the proof which was presented to the Honourable Houses of Parliament, by the Reverend Assembly (and before we entred into the Debate, was brought in by the Committee, in the instance of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem)</hi> this is one Medium, that mention is made of the Multitudes there, as of one Church, and of Elders, as the Elders of that Church. Yea, and there being no mention made, of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct particular Congregations or Churches therein, but of a <hi>Church,</hi> and the Elders thereof; as thereby the prime Notion of a Church is held forth and Attributed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; So the prime and more principle Relation of Elders, as Elders to this one Church, and every Member of them is imported, and so as true and as Genuine a Relation (according to the Scripture's intent and expression) must be supposed to be intended, as can be supposed between any particular Congregation and their Elders. Yea, and moreover, to make out the Presbyterial Government over those many Congregations, as one Church, whilst the Apostles were the Rulers of it, the Apostles themselves are made to act and become, as ordinary Elders to that Church. It was therefore desired, that they who should deny this Proposition, would rase out of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for ever, all such expressions; and that in the proofs after, to be brought to Establish the Presbytery, they would forbear that Medium, which yet as a main studd in this Building, cannot be wanting.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Relation, which these Elders have, must be a more special Relation: As is evident from the practice and principles of this Government. For when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, in Shires, are divided into several Presbyteries or Deanries, the Elders (though Neighbours) of a bordering Presbytery, intermeddle not with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under another Presbytery; and yet they are for their Office Elders. It is therefore a special Relation, puts the difference, that those of these Presbyteries, Judge the Congregations under them, as having a special Relation to them, such as not to other Congregations. So the Elders of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as they all had the Relation of Elders to that Church, so they had a special Relation to that Church; and the Church was an intire distinct Church within it self, from the rest of the Churches in <hi>Judea,</hi> and the Elders of that Church were in such a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Elders thereof, as of no Church else in <hi>Judea;</hi> yea, in such a sense as they might be said not to be Elders of those other Churches, but of this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is an ordinary standing Relation: For they exercise and assume a constant and ordinary power, as the Presbyters of lesser Congregations do. Their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as Elders, in a Presbytery, are constant and ordinary, as those of the lesser Presbyteries are; and as these are Established for the smaller matters of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so these always are for the greater, and most Solemn; and they are both alike ordinary: For their Meeting, Work, and Exercise of power, being standing their relation must be suitable and answerable, to that of Elders in their Congregations respectively.</p>
                  <p>Unto the Argument, several Answers were given by the Reverend Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. 1. Some said, that they meet not <hi>Qua</hi> Elders, only <hi>Qui:</hi> They, meet, as Commissioners, but not as Elders. But this answer is taken away, by the first and second Argument; which proves, they have the Relation of Elders in Ruling. 2. It was denyed by others, that if they make up a Presbytery to these Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all the people of them, that then they must bear the Relation of Elders to these Congregations, and every Member of them: For though they are Elders taken singly and apart, as in Relation to their several Congregations, which they are affix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto; yet in this their conjunction into a common Presbytery over them all,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:154381:94"/> they bear the Relation of Elders, but of a Presbytery or Eldership acting all in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: For as all these Congregations, under this Government, are to be considered as one Body, and as making up one Church, so all these Elders, met in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, are to be considered as one Body and community; and therefore although they be considered altogether a Presbytery to that whole Church; yet it follows not, that they bear the Relation of Elders to each Congregation or Person they Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; for according to that Logick Rule, <hi>Quod convenit toti qua toti, non convenit cuilibet parti, what agrees to the whole, as a whole, doth not agree to every part;</hi> these Elders, as in a Presbytery, make one <hi>Totum aggregatum;</hi> and these Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as making up one Church, make another <hi>Totum aggregatum</hi> correlative thereunto: But take any Elder out of this Presbytery, and consider him in a single Relation to any of those Churches under the Presbytery; and he is not an Elder of any of those Churches, no more than if you take any Member of all those Congregations, that make up a classical Church; it would follow, that therefore he is a Member of all those many Congregations, whereas he is only a Member of that Community, as making one Church. And it was exemplified thus; that in <hi>Juda,</hi> the Heads of the Tribes Governed the Tribes; but so, as the Heads of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> were not the Heads of the Tribe of <hi>Manasses;</hi> and so in the University, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Heads of <hi>Trinity Colledge,</hi> and of <hi>Queen's Colledge,</hi> are altogether Heads of the University, as a common Body; but it follows not, that the Head of <hi>Trinity Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> is Head of <hi>Queen's,</hi> and of all the other Colledges: And so in Parliament, a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gess of <hi>Warwickshire</hi> acts for all <hi>England;</hi> yet it follows not, he is a Burgess of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> So the case is here, they are Elders in <hi>sensu composito,</hi> as united into one Presbytery or Community; but not in <hi>sensu diviso,</hi> to each of these Congregations, but each to their proper Congregations, to which they are affixed: As the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels in an Army, are Collonels but to their several Regiments; yet they all joyn in one Body, as a Councel of War to the whole Army. And so these are Elders here in <hi>sensu aggregato,</hi> collectively to all the Congregations, though apart with a more special Relation to each. It was Retorted also, that in a particular Congregation, according to our Principles, the community of all the Brethren have power over any particular Member, as <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> with the rest over <hi>John;</hi> but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not, that <hi>Peter</hi> hath power over <hi>John</hi> apart, but only as in this Community considered; and so in this Presbytery, all these Elders are a Presbytery to the whole; but yet bear not the Relation of Elders to each apart considered. But we answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we had the greatest reason to take it for granted (from the former Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings and Expressions of the Presbyterial Divines; as also because the main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which themselves had proved this Government, have been taken from it) that many Congregations, in the New Testament, do make one Church; and that the Elders thereof, are Elders of that one Church, and therefore they are to Govern that Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Logical Axiom is indeed true, <hi>Quod convenit toti, qua toti, non conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit cuilibet parti,</hi> and so here, that which doth <hi>competere toti,</hi> to the whole of those Elders, belongs not to every part: For take them all as met together, they are a Presbytery; and accordingly each Elder is not a Presbytery, to all these Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nor doth the Argument suppose it, but only that if they all be a common Presbytery to all these Congregations, that then they bear the Relation of Elders to them. Thus in a particular Congregation, though all the Elders are acknowledged by all, to be Elders to every Member of the Congregation; yet each cannot be said to be a Presbytery to the whole, or each Member; for that which belongs to the whole, as the whole belongs not to every part. That indeed which belongs to an <hi>aggregate</hi> whole, or collective community, formally considered as such, cannot be Attributed to every part; but what materially belongs to them, belongs to each apart. As take an heap of Stones, 'tis true, each Stone, is not an heap of Stones: but each Stone is a Stone; and both the Stones apart, and as an heap may be said to be such or such a Man's propriety, and to relate to him; so this company of Elders must be supposed both a Presbytery, and also Elders to this whole People, and every Member of them,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they be a Presbytery in common to those Congregations, then according to the Scripture Notion and Expression (and what the Scriptures hold forth, is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of this Debate) they bear the Relation of Elders also; and then they
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:154381:94"/> must be such Elders, as the Exhortations and Duties of Elders mentioned do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. Now this consequence we make good by these Arguments:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scriptures would have the people look at them, and Honour them as El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in all Acts of Ruling and Governing, those especially wherein the most and chief of Government lies, and wherein the excellency of their Ruling is seen: Now the chief of the Acts of Government, and the most excellent thereof, are assumed and exercised by these Elders, met in a common Presbytery, as Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore they that exercise such Acts of Government over Congregations, must bear the Relation of Elders to them; for upon that Relation, we are to Honour them, as performing this Rule; and under that Relation, they must be said to perform it, <hi>The Elders that Rule well, are worthy of double Honour, especially those that labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. From whom are they to have this Honour given them, but from the People under them, and to be Honoured in their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this, as well in Ruling as in Preaching, though an <hi>Especially</hi> is put upon that. And therefore if in giving this Honour to them that labour in Preaching to them; they are to look at them, under the Relation of Elders, and their Elders la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the Word to them; then in giving that Honour to them that Rule them, they are so to look upon them, and therefore they must sustain that Relation in that Ruling; and besides, otherwise we destroy the Relation of Elders, as Elders in the Highest Acts of Governing, which are exercised in a Presbytery, whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calls them Elders in Ruling, as well as in Preaching.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The New Testament doth indifferently and promiscuously, use the word Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and the word Elders of the same persons, in Relation to the same people; and therefore to whom the Elders are supposed to be a Presbytery, to them they must bear the Relation of Elders. That the phrase is promiscuously used, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 33. where those that are called <hi>Elders of the People,</hi> are called, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 66. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>Presbytery of the People,</hi> so that if they were Related as a Presbytery to the people, to the same people they were Related as El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Neither are they said to be Elders in Relation to their being a Presbytery, but to the people; therefore it is not said the Elders of the Presbytery, but of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as bearing a direct Relation as Elders to the people: And so in Analogy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, if they be a presbytery to many Congregations, they must be supposed Elders of those Congregations; for to whom ever they are a Presbytery, to them they are Elders; and to whom ever they are Elders, to them upon occasion they are a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery. And in Analogy, the New Testament useth the word Presbytery, as under the Gospel but once, and in all places else, the Holy Ghost still when he exhorts them to their Duties, calls them Elders, or them <hi>that have the Rule over you,</hi> and yet in all those places, he intends to involve the Duty of Elders, as met in a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, as well as those singly performed to each person.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is evident from the like parallel instance of the Eldership of a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, where the Elders bear the Relation of Elders to each Member, and when met in common, they are an Eldership or Presbytery in common to that Church, and each Member of it. And then this their being a Community, takes not away their Relation of being Elders, as if the answer given by the Respondents, should hold, it would; for they would only be a Presbytery, and not Elders in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, when as they never are Elders more than then, and are not Elders of that Church, because met in a Presbytery; but therefore meet in a Presbytery over that Congregation, because they personally bear the Relation of Elders to it. And when they meet in that Presbytery, they are Elders particularly to each Member, as well as are Universal Elders in the Assembled presbytery. The Scripture commits the care of Churches, to these as in a presbytery, as well as out of it; and therefore they are Elders of their particular Flock in this presbytery, as well as when out of it. Thus <hi>(Acts</hi> 20. 28.) all the care of the Flock was committed to them as Elders, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Relation to it as such; and therefore when met in a presbytery (therein to have care of the Flock, or any Member of it) they were Elders to it. And they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to meet in a presbytery; because they were first Elders to their several Respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Congregations; and that they must be acknowledged Elders of all the people in those Congregations, the very instance it self alledged by our Brethren, will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear; for the General Elders of all the Tribes, were called Elders of the people,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:154381:95"/>
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. So as suppose the same individual persons, had been Members of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or common Eldership of the people, and also Elders of the Tribes Respectively; yet they might as justly be called Elders of all those Tribes in their General Relation, for such ends and purposes, as truly as they were Elders to their particular Tribes, for other ends and purposes. Now therefore by like Reason, must all the Elders in this common Presbytery, have the Relation of Elders to all the Congregations, as well as severally they have their proper Relations to their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Congregations. For if in the instance given of the Jewish Government, we take all causes common to all the Tribes, as the Elders of <hi>Manasses,</hi> were Elders to the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> so in like manner must these Elders of a Presbytery, in common to all these Congregations, be supposed to be to each Congregation, when any cause comes afore them in their cognisance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Those places and exhortations of Scripture, concerning the Duties of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to their Flocks, and their Flocks to them, may be alledged to strengthen the Argument, Heb. 13. 7. <hi>Remember them that have the Rule over you, and have spoken the Word of God to you.</hi> And 1 Thess. 5. 12. <hi>Know them which labour among you, and are over you, and Admonish you.</hi> And to the same purpose is the charge, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. To the Elders of <hi>Ephesus, Feed the Flock,</hi> &amp;c. These are all spoken of them, and to them, under the very Notion and Relation of Elders and Rulers, (which is Equivalent) and as their Rulers and Elders. And surely if any Person in a Congregation, were called afore one of those Presbyteries, over many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, they would urge upon the Conscience of the Person, these and the like places to obey them, by vertue of these commands. If he should Reply, that these places speak of such as have the Relation of Elders to their Flocks, and every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therein; and that by vertue of their being such to them, this Obedience is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon them; but you of the Presbytery, do not own the Elders of your Prebytery to have a Relation to the Congregation I am of, and so I am quit of Obedience to you; how could they by vertue of these places, holding this principle, that they have not the Relation of Elders to him, enforce Obedience from him? And how will his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science ever be brought to a Submission to their Sentence against him, if not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Relation to him thus Specified? And yet would not these Elders by the Presbyterial Principles expect equal, if not more Obedience from him, than the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of that particular Congregation he is a Member of would do? I am sure that in practice, they assume more; and I doubt not, but any one of these Elders, or all of them apart, would as Authoritatively Admonish him (as an Elder to him) in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate after the cause is brought afore the Presbytery, to obey and submit to them, as any of his own Elders would do before or after their publick Admonition, and would require Obedience to him as an Elder, by vertue of these places of Scripture before mentioned. If therefore they would require it; then the Relation must be the same. Yea, do not often some few of the Elders of a common Presbytery, come into particular Congregations, and perform Acts of Government, and ordain Elders to them; and in case of obstinacy, Excommunicate the Elders of any particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation? Upon what plea of Authority do they this, as Elders to that particular Congregation, or not?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We come now to consider the other Distinction. 1. Of their being Elders only in a community to all these Congregations as one Church, in <hi>sensu aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:</hi> And 2. Of their being apart, Elders unto their particular Congregations respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively: And so the Duties mentioned of Feeding the Flock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> concern them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as considered apart; but Acts of Government, belong to them as Elders in a Presbytery. We reply 1. That this Answer supposeth two distinct differing Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the one a more particular Relation of Elders, as proper Elders to their several Congregations apart; and another more common Relation of the same persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as Elders meerly, as in a Presbytery. Now for the confirmation or Establishment of this Distinction, by the one side or the other, the Foundation on which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, must be remembred, <hi>viz.</hi> what the Scriptures hold forth; and therefore what ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Suppositions or Instances may be found in other constitutions, to Illustrate such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions here; yet if what the New Testament speaks of Elders in Relation to their Flock, warranteth it not, yea crosseth it, <hi>it may not be.</hi> Now then it is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that when the New Testament speaks of Elders and Churches, it speaks Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally, and without Distinction of a different Relation. It calls them simply and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:154381:95"/> simply <hi>Elders of the Church,</hi> and delivers (in that Relation to their Church, they were Elders of) Exhortations to their Duties, which that Relation specially called for; and in those exhortations intends their Duties, as their Elders, met in a Presbytery; as well as those they are to perform in other Ministrations towards their Flocks, and on the other side, exhorts the people in like simular expressions, to Obey and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their Elders that Preach the Word, Rule them, and Admonish them, prescribing Obedience to them, in their Rule in a Presbytery, as well as in other Administrations; and all this without any Distinction of this Relation of Elders in common, and in special. And farther 'tis enjoyned, that these presbyterial Elders, must perform those Duties which belong to their Office, unto all those they are thus Elders unto, without any Manifest Distinction of any several bounds of this so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Relation. This evidently argueth, that there is but one single Relation of Elders, to one Flock, to whom they perform these Duties; and that the same that Preach, ought to Rule them in publick; and that the same Persons that Admonish them privately, do also in the publick Presbytery Rule them; and that the same Persons that Rule them in those publick Presbyteries, do Admonish them in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. So then, the same Persons sustain in the Holy Ghosts intention, and view when he made those exhortations, one and the same Univocal Relation of Elders to their Flocks, committed by him to them, whether they be met in a Presbytery for Acts of Government, or otherwise perform the Duties of Elders apart. And it is evident, that in a particular Congregation, they are Elders in one Univocal Simular Relation, unto the whole Flock, and every Member thereof. But now this is the wonder, that when Elders are thus affixed to particular Congregations; and that their Relation is a differing Relation from that other in common Presbyteries (yea, so vastly differing, that our Brethren dare scarce acknowledge them Elders, calling them rather a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, than Elders of those Churches) that yet the exhortations in the Scriptures, should so univocally fall on them, to so differing Duties, founded on differing Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that yet this only Genuine Relation of Elders to their particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, should not be mentioned apart; and the Duties accompanying it, singled out from the rest, seems to us very strange. Yea, and to direct the Discharge of the Duties of the People likewise, to either of these Elders (that they might know what Duties to perform to their more proper Elders, acknowledged theirs by way of so eminent and differing a Relation, and what to those more common; and that all confusion might be prevented, that the one assume not the Duties of the other) it was as necessary to have set the differing Limits of these, as to set the bounds of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the Church, which the Holy Ghost hath done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And Secondly, If there had been this differing Relation of Elders, which from those Similitudes in Common-wealths, Armies, and the Universities is given; it was necessary that the Scripture should have held it forth, either by differing Names and Respects, or by differing charges, whereby it might appear, that <hi>this Relation</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to this Duty, and <hi>the other Relation</hi> to that; which being not done in Scripture, the Distinction will not pass upon us. That it is thought necessary, that the Scripture should prescribe herein, appears from the instances brought by the Reverend Respondents. As 1. That of the Tribes, where there were General El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all the Tribes, and there were (and perhaps some of them the same Men) Heads and Elders of Tribes: But as this was a differing Relation, and respect in the same or diverse Persons, so they had Names and Titles of difference and distinction; for the Heads General (as we may call them) were called Elders of the People: The particular Elders of particular Tribes, were called by way of Distinction from them, Elders of such Cities, Families, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there were as Distinct Laws given, so that in some causes the Elders of the several Tribes did judge such and such particulars in their Tribes Respectively: And the General Elders had reserved cases, of War, Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So in that Instance of Heads of Colledges, and Heads of the University; there is as a differing Relation, so a Distinguishing Character. For the Names are changed, since the particular Bodies are called Colledges; and the General Body the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And their several special Relation to their Colledges, is expressed by the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Masters of such or such Colledges; and the other by the Title of Heads to the University. Yea, and accordingly there are differing Statutes, the Local Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes for each Colledge apart, or for Colledges as Colledges, and the Duties of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:154381:96"/> in their special Relations; and there are Statutes for the University, and for their Duties as Heads of it. And this Distinction or Difference was necessary here too, if there were this differing Relation: But for the case in hand, if we come to the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, to find out the several Modifications and Relations of Elders therein, we still read but simply and singly, Elders and Churches, as Relatives, without any such Note of Distinction of a classical Church, and the Presbytery thereof; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Church, and the Elders thereof. The New Testament in all its menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning of Elders, speaks uniformly of them, as Elders of the Church, and this Rule is to us certain, <hi>Ʋbi Scriptura non distinguit, nec debemus distinguere, Where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes no Distinction, we ought not to make any.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however, I will Represent the difference between us and our Brethren, by the Proposition of such a Case in Law as this is: If all the Records and Ruled Cases and Laws of this Kingdom, should, in setting down the ordinary Government thereof, have made mention only and singly, of <hi>Burgesses</hi> (as the Rulers) of Corporations (as the Correlate to them) and used no other Distinguishing Word (when yet there were undeniably Burgesses of every incorporate Town, continued from Antiquity) might any one afterwards pretend, that this Word <hi>Corporation,</hi> was intended by our Ancestors, to import an Association or Community of many of these Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in one Shire; and that by Burgesses of these Corporations, were meant a community of all these Burgesses in one Body for Government; and so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the same Name without Distinction, and say, that these Communities were also meant, and to prove it, give instance in some Foreign Government, where there are States General of Provinces, and States particular of Cities; when as they have in <hi>their Laws,</hi> a Distinction and Differencing Character; but in the Laws of this Kingdom, there is no such Distinction made? But now if the Laws about the choice of such Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses in each Corporation, and the Duties given them in charge, and their Relation to their Corporations, do run without any Distinction of what the Burgesses in the supposed greater Corporations should do, in that Relation and Community; from what the same Burgesses in their lesser Corporations do in their more proper Relations: Yea, and if the Duties set down in those Laws, mutually between Corporations, and those Burgesses, should argue an inconsistency with the Government of Burgesses, over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Corporations in common; but should all naturally fall in with that of Burgesses over single Corporations, and argue such a Relation: Would not this plainly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that therefore the Laws of the Kingdom did hold forth, there might not be (that is, according to the Laws thereof) such a Government of the Burgesses of Corporations over many others? And if in answer to such Arguments, it should be said, that both these might be consistent; for that in other Foreign States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Societies, there are Burgesses of particular Corporations, and there are Burgesses in an Assembly of Parliament (so called by way of Distinction) met in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for the ordinary Government of all those Corporations in common; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the like may be here in this: The reply were easy, that what ever such Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there is in other States; yet the question is of such Burgesses, as the Laws of this State holds forth, and as this Kingdom hath set up, where there is no such Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Burgesses of Corporations, and Burgesses in Parliament mentioned; but on the contrary, only one single uniform Stile and Title in the Laws, Namely, Burgesses of the Corporations; and further, the Rules about their choice and duties mutually between them, and the Corporations they have Relation to, be also delivered without any difference; which doth argue them to have been Anciently the Relation of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses to some one Corporation, and not many; yea, to be utterly incongruous and inconsistent, with such a manifold Relation. Now Parallel to this case, are our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; and the Answers given to the Arguments of our Presbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p>But they Retort the Argument upon us, and say, that it follows no more, that they are to be Elders to each Congregation, because joyned in a common Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than that in a particular Congregation; <hi>Peter</hi> or one Member apart, hath a power over <hi>John;</hi> because in community with the rest of the Brethren, he hath power over any one.</p>
                  <p>We answer, That let this Parallel decide it; and then as the Foundation of any one Members having an interest in that community over <hi>John,</hi> or any other, consists, in this that he stands in the Relation of a Brother to <hi>John,</hi> as a Member of that Church; and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:154381:96"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o in like manner to all the rest of the Members in that community: So likewise all and every one, when in that common Fraternity, stand in the very same Relation of Brethren to <hi>John,</hi> as well as when they are apart out of it; and do not become Brethren, having power over him, because met in a community; but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meet, because as Brethren; this Duty lies on them in common, to Judge him as much as in private to Admonish him; and so one and the same Relation, puts them upon both these Duties. And in Scripture, the Exhortations run to the same Persons to perform these Duties, though of differing sort; because of their Relation as Brethren. Let this Parallel be applyed to the thing in hand, and as it answers the Instance, so it strengthens our Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> If they be acknowledged to have the Relation of Elders, as Assembled in a Presbytery; and in that respect, to have a Relation to all the People in the several Congregations: Yet still the same Incongruities mentioned will follow upon it. For many of those Duties from all the Congregation, as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Maintenance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are due to them, as well as to their own Elders, for that their Works sake: And the Acts too also of these Elders in this Presbytery, though in common, are the most eminent Acts that belong to the Office of Elders; and in which the Consciences and Interest of the People, and each Member, is as much concerned, as in the daily Preaching of their more proper Elders (as for Distinction sake, we now call them) for they have power, and they alone to cut them off from all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and to deliver them unto Satan. Now then, if they are to be interested in the choice of their proper Elders, to Rule them in smaller things, then their concern ought to be, as much in the choice of, and consenting to these their General Elders, and they should be present at the Ordination of all of them; for one great part of their Function, is to be exercised towards any, and all of those Congregations in a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way; yea, and to Rule them in matters of the greatest concernment. Thus then so far, as they are acknowledged Elders, so far these Inconveniences will still follow upon the Heels of that acknowledgment; and the Scriptures indifferently speaking the same things, without Distinction of both these kind of Relations, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Name of Elders, the People have as much cause to challenge their right about the one, as they have about the other; and these Elders may expect the same (by vertue of those Scriptures) from the People.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Incongruities which flow from the Elders of a Presbytery, sustaining special Relation of Elders to all the particular Congregations.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I have proved, that if a Presbytery be set over many Congregations, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof must bear a special Relation of constant, and established Elders to all those Congregations: I shall now evince, that for these Elders already fixed to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charges, to sustain also a special Relation of Ordinary and Standing Elders to all these Congregations, as one Church; and all the people thereof, as Members of that Church; carries with it Great and Manifold Incongruities, and Inconsistencies also, with what the Scriptures hold forth concerning Elders, and other Officers of Churches, as also with the Principles professed by the Reformed Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This breeds an Incongruous Disproportion, between the Relation of the Officers of a Church, of this sort of Officers, Namely Elders, in the extent of their Relation and Power; and of those other sort of Officers of the Churches, acknowledged by the Reformed Churches, <hi>viz. Deacons.</hi> Now let us therefore put it to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the consciencious, whether what the Scripture speaks of Elders, and of their Commission, Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their several Relations to the Flock under them, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford clearer characters of the extent of their standing Government, to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational to one Congregation, than of its being classical over many. Yea, let us see whether the Descriptions of Elders, and Exhortations given unto them concerning their several charges, do not plainly overthrow any such Relation of Elders (as El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) unto many Congregations, as Inconsistent thereunto. Surely unto us, there
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:154381:97"/> appear many great and unanswerable Incongruities and Inconsistencies, in this classical Government </p>
                  <p>If we compare the extent of this Office of Elders in their Relation, with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of other Church Officers in their Relation; we shall find, that what holds true of one sort of ordinary Officers of a Church, according to the word, may well be supposed to hold true of another; or else there is a disproportion between the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Relations of Officers; and the one is not of like extent with the other, which yet the Scriptures make commensurable, and to be of equal extent. More plainly, if the Scriptures had intended, and held forth many Churches, as making one Church; and the Elders of those many Churches, to have been Elders in common to those Churches, as one Church; then the Deacons of all those Churches, should make up a common Deaconry, and be Deacons in common, unto all those Churches in an ordinary way, as the other are Elders. But this is contrary to the practice of the Reformed Churches, though subject to the Presbyterial Government, in which the Deacons have the ordinary Relation of Deacons, in no respect extended further than to a particular Congregation: Nor do they exercise Acts of that Office, in a set way to other Congregations, nor to Neighbour Congregations more than to another; much less is there a common Deaconship of them all. And yet why should not this common Deaconry be erected over all those Churches, as one Church, as well as a common El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership, especially if in matters of this Nature, a parity of Reason should carry it? For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Church in Scripture, and all the Officers are alike Relatives, as a Church and the Elders are. The best of the Presbyterial Arguments for this common Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, are founded upon the commensurable extent and relation of Church and Elders; that if any Churches make one Church, then the Elders of them all make one Eldership, and they are Elders in common unto them; then why not the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons also? Now this Reason of theirs, fetcht from this Mutual Relation of one Church, and one Eldership or Elders thereof, will require the like for Deacons: for every Church, as it is a Church, being a Body, hath a Relation to all its Officers, as Organical Members thereof: As we have it asserted, Rom. 12. 4. <hi>As we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Members in one Body, and all Members have not the same Office,</hi> so it is also in the Church of Christ; and the Members have several Offices in the Church, which be mentioneth, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and so if that Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were one Body, and a Church of many Churches; then the Deacons were Deacons in common of those many Churches, as they all were one Church. For as the Pastors and Teachers Office is held forth in that following Description, ver. 8. <hi>He that Exhorteth, and he that Teacheth:</hi> So the Deacons in that, <hi>He that Giveth.</hi> And in the Analogy of the Natural Body (to which there the Apostle refers us, to exemplifie this of a Church organized with Officers, as a Body to Christ) though one Member may be less and inferiour to another, in bulk or use; yet it is a Member of that whole Body in its use. The little Finger, is a Finger of the whole Body, as well as the Arm is a Member of the whole: The Foot that serves the whole Body, is a Member in its Office, as fully as the Hand; and the extent of its Jurisdiction or Use, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its kind, is the same, by vertue of the same Relations. If therefore these are Elders in common, or an Eldership do Rule in common those Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as <hi>One Church,</hi> and as Organical Members thereof, as one Body; then why should not the Deacons in as ordinary a way, perform their Office in common, and bear the Relation of Deacons in common unto all, as <hi>One Church?</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Scriptures do confirm this like commensurable extent of the Deacons and Elders Office, as Relating to a Church: For the Apostle Writing to <hi>Philippi,</hi> a Church in a City (which therefore we suppose our Brethren will needs have to have been a Presbyterial Church, of many Congregations, lest any one instance of a compleat Congregational Church, should be left unto us) He Writes to the Bishops (the Elders) and the Deacons of that Church. And <hi>Acts</hi> 6. the Deacons of the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (if there were many Congregations, as our Brethren suppose) were chosen by the whole Multitude, when gathered together by the Twelve; and therefore were Deacons of that whole Church, as well as the Elders were Elders thereof. Now if the Deacons Office should thus be extended to all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the Elders is; then why should not each Church be bound to bring Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions to the Deacons of each Church, to be distributed in common; and so our
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:154381:97"/> Purses should be subject to the Deacons in common, as far as our consciences to the Elders in common; and they might challenge the same power in their Office over the one, that the Elders do over the other: And then also each Congregation were in as ordinary and standing an obligation, bound to Relieve all the poor in those Churches, as well as those in their own: Not only by the common Law of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but by vertue of a special Relation of their being one Church; which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in all these things, doth beget the like obligation, that it doth in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And so all things in this Nature, should be alike common to all and each; and there should be a common Treasury for this one great <hi>Diaconate Church</hi> (as we may in a Parallel Allusion, to that other Name of Presbyterial call it) as there is a common <hi>Regimen</hi> or Government, for this great Presbyterial Church. This strange Disproportion between the Officers or Members of this Body, which the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Government doth make, seems to us, at least, unnatural: Whereas this (as all other things) fall in suitably and naturally, when the Relation of Elders and Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, is extended no further than each Congregation; which, as it is to be an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Body unto Christ, so the Officers and Members thereof, according to the Law of Nature, are alike Members of, and for that Body; and the Use, Service, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of all and each in their several kinds, bear alike proportion to the whole. And that even by the practice and judgment of the Reformed Churches themselves, the Deacons are confined to each particular Congregation, is to us a Testimony (as the remaining Office of Overseers for the poor under the Episcopal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath been judged a pregnant evidence of the Deacons Office once in the Church) that the limits of a Church and Elders were all once within a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation, although the Elders, because a Superior Office, have assumed to extend their power and jurisdiction in their kind, further than the other more inferior in theirs.</p>
                  <p>But let it be supposed, that some reason of difference might be given of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion in the Elder's Office, and the Deacons, and that a common Deaconry would not follow upon a common Presbytery. Yet</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are other as great Incongruities will fall upon the very Relations of the Elders Offices themselves, which this Frame of fixed Elders to some Congregations respectively, and yet of ordinary Elders to all of them, causeth. God hath made some Preaching Elders; some Ruling Elders (as the Reformed Churches allow) or Church-Governours to assist the Pastors in Government. And to Preaching Elders, both Preaching and Ruling belongs; which are conjunct in that Office, according to the Principles of the Presbyterial Government, and the Scriptures. But the business of Ruling, belongs only to the other; and by this they are distinct, as two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Species, or as the Sensitive and Reasonable Soul, whereof the one hath Sense only in all its Acts, the other both Sense and Reason, and yet are Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifically distinct.</p>
                  <p>Every Church of Christ, is a Body ordered, <hi>Coloss.</hi> 2. 1. Rejoycing (says <hi>Paul)</hi> to see your Order. And the intent of the Presbyterial Government, is professed to be, to preserve Order in the Church; and if in any thing this Order is most to be seen, it is in the Distinction and Order of the Officers thereof. Now this Frame of Government, brings in a great Disorder in the Offices and Officers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds them, and their Relations. To Demonstrate this, let us consider the Pastors, or Preaching Elders. They are all undeniably Preaching Elders, to their particular Congregations, of which they are the fixt Pastors; and yet they have another Relation of Elders (by means of this Presbyterial Government) to all these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, considered as one Church: And if these Pastors be any way Elders to both; they must Sustain the Title of both sorts of Elders in these two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Relations, which is an evident confounding of both these Offices, in one and the same person. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is evident, that they do each apart, bear the Title and Relation of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders unto their particular Congregations; and such pastors, or such preaching Elders, they can be to no more or other than those they ordinarily preach unto; for they Labour in the Word and Doctrine, unto no other; and this is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Distinction from the other Elders and Governours, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. And it is evident, that they being fixt each as Pastors to their particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, cannot Labour in the Word and Doctrine to them all; therefore they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:154381:98"/> sustain this Title in Distinction of Elders, only unto those their several charges. And it is certain, that all Offices have their Distinction and Denomination, from that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Praxis or Function they are ordained unto: As that is an Eye to the Body, whose Praxis or Function is to see for the whole Body. They can therefore be said to be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders to no other of this classical Church, than that Praxis of Preaching is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto. It is an Argument which <hi>Whitaker</hi> useth against the Pope; and our Divines make use of it against the Bishops: That nor he nor they, can be said to be Pastors unto all they yet pretended to be Pastors unto, because they are not able to exercise the Function of Pastors unto them. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ask what sort of Elders the Pastors are that are in this common Presbytery? What sort of Relation of Elders do they bear to this one Presbyterial Church, over and above that Relation, they, as Pastors, bear to their own? (And this Church and Elders, as Elders, are Relatives, as well as the particular Congregations and their Elders, or else this Great Church, must want its correlative of Elders to it) Surely they bear no other Relation, than of Ruling Elders, if they be Elders at all (and to make them no Elders, and not to have the Relation of Elders to this Great Church in this Presbytery, we believe will not be affirmed) And if they be Elders, then the Notion of their being Elders, must have one of those two forementioned Formal Differences annexed to it, either of Preaching Elders, or meerly Ruling: And this Difference and Denomination must be fetcht (as was said afore) from the differing Praxis, or use they serve for. And it is evident, that the ordinary Acts they serve for, and exercise in those common Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, are meerly Acts of Ruling Elders (in all which therefore, Ruling Elders concur in common with them) and accordingly it is called the Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And further, the power of an Office in the Church (though exercised but as conjoyned with others) is a Relation in respect to some Administration in a constancy; now the constant and ordinary Administration they serve for in such a Presbytery, is only Ruling, not Teaching, there being no Acts but such, that Ruling Elders joyn in. So as by this Frame, the same Preaching Elder or Pastor, must bear two sorts of ordinary Offices, in these two Relations, of a Preaching, and a meer Ruling Elder, as if one were both a Physician and a Chirurgeon, and were fixed to one of the Companies in the City, to practice Physick to them, he sustained the Office of a Physician to that Company; and if he were besides, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to practice Chirurgery, to many other Companies, he were certainly only a Chirurgeon unto them, as truly as a Physician to the other. So as we shall not need to Dispute the point of Ruling Elders any more; for here are such as are El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, acknowledged such by all sides, and yet for the sort of their Office, but plain Ruling Elders, and deserve properly in this Relation, no other Name, if we hold the Presbyterial Government; and they are as truly and properly to this Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Church such, and no other, as those Governours that Preach not at all, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those they are Elders unto.</p>
                  <p>And this Incongruity, no Distinction will Salve; call them Elders in this Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, in what Sense you please, whether in <hi>Sensu diviso,</hi> or <hi>Conjuncto,</hi> yet Elders they are; and if so, then one of these two sorts of Elders, they must be to this Presbyterial Church, either both Preaching and Ruling Elders, or meerly Ruling. Their being Elders together in this Presbytery, cannot be supposed to Divest them of the Title of some sort of Elders (and there is not a third sort) no more than the Elders of a Congregation, met in a Presbytery, do thereby loose the Title of Elders, which they sustain to that Congregation, or no more (as was even now instanced) than when the Body hath two Eyes, that always concur in one Act of sight, either of them should not be Denominated Eyes unto the Body apart, and the one called the left, and the other the right.</p>
                  <p>The Disorder and Confusion hereby, may be further set out, 1. That by this means, the same Officer hath a full Relation to one Church, and but half a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation unto another; and it causeth him to perform the whole of his Offices to one Church (the particular Church) to which he hath Relation, and but the half thereof to the other. And 2. It makes an ordinary Pastor, not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the work of two Officers, but to bear the Relation of two Offices; for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:154381:98"/> in his several Relations to these two several Churches, his Congregational and Classi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, his Relations are parted and divided.</p>
                  <p>And it brings up the same Absurdity which was put upon Episcopal Government; That a Bishop professing himself to bear the Relation of a Pastor to the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; yet was but a Ruling Elder to them, not a Teaching.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To extend a Pastor's power of ordinary Ruling, beyond the extent of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Teaching, is against the order which Christ hath set (and all extent of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, must as well have an Institution of Christ, as the Power or Office it self; for the difference of Evangelists, and of ordinary Pastors, lay but in extent of power) and then we argue thus; if the extent of a Pastor's ordinary Ruling Power, as a Pastor and Elder, be but to the Flock, as his whole Flock, which he is able to Feed: Then to bear the Relation of a Pastor or Elder for ordinary Government, to any more than he is able, and doth thus Feed, <hi>May not be.</hi> But the extent of a Pastor's ordinary Ruling power, is but to that Flock, as his whole Flock, which he is able to Feed. And this Argument, as also the former; besides that, it serves to make up more Incongruities of this Presbyterial Government, so it might stand alone, and make a compleat Argument of it self against it; for if the Pastor's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary power in Ruling, be not to be extended further than of his ordinary Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then this ordinary standing Government of Pastors fixed for Preaching to their own Congregations, may not be over those many in common.</p>
                  <p>Now that the extent of a Pastor's ordinary Ruling power, reacheth only to that Flock which he is able to Feed, I prove 1. By Scripture. 2. By Reason.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I prove it by Scripture, Acts 20. 28. <hi>Take heed to your selves, and to all the</hi>

                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note>
                     <hi>Flock</hi> (the whole Flock) <hi>over which the Holy Ghost hath made you Over-seers, to Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own Blood.</hi> Here are 1. Elders, <hi>(ver.</hi> 17.) spoken to. 2. Their having Relation to a Flock, an whole Flock is mentioned. 3. They are enjoyned to <hi>Feed the Flock, and the whole Flock:</hi> And all these are commensurable. Whence 1. We see that the special Limitation of their extensive Power and Relation to a Flock, and to all the Flock, is set by the Holy Ghost, and not by Man; and therefore is not to be extended by Man, further than the Holy Ghost hath appointed. 2. The extent of that Relation, is to that Flock; and the whole Flock they Feed, and they are to Feed all that Flock alike: And if they be Preaching Elders, then they must Feed it by Preaching; and therefore are Overseers to them, to Feed them, and because they Feed them. 3. He speaks to Preaching Elders especially, that Feed by Doctrine: For 1. He propounds his own Example to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. that he had Revealed the whole Counsel of God. And 2. He says, ver. 30. <hi>Some of you shall arise, speaking perverse things.</hi> And 'tis <hi>Pauls</hi> farewell; and (as <hi>Baynes</hi> argues against Bishops▪) those to whom at last the Apostles commended Churches, were the ordinary Governors left; but he commended them not to a Bishop, but ordinary Elders. Thus we argue also, for the extent of the Relation of those Elders that they are to Govern only that Flock that they are able to Feed; and therefore they have not the Office of Overseeing, as ordinary Elders over those whom they Feed not. And <hi>Peter</hi> seconds <hi>Paul</hi> in this, 1 Pet. 5. 2. <hi>Feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> the Flock, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> among you, is that Flock that any of them had Relation to, as his Flock Respectively. Thereupon Writing unto the Churches in a whole Nation, in <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. (whereas in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. the charge is to the particular Elders of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to that whole Flock) he therefore puts in that Note of Respectiveness <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> among you, that is, that which Respectively belongs to you, answerable to which is that Text, Col. 1. 17. <hi>Who is for you a Faithful Minister,</hi> that is, your proper Pastor: And <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. They ordained Elders Church by Church, <hi>Elders to them,</hi> that is, proper Elders to them, so the Flock <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies your several proper Flocks that belong to you. Hereby it appears, that their Feeding, and their oversight over any of those Flocks, are commensurable; and <hi>that Flock</hi> which they are not able to Feed, they have not the oversight over, for they are both of the same extent. Thus also, Heb. 13. 7. 17. <hi>Remember them that have the Rule over you, and have spoken to you the Word of God,</hi> which he speaks of Preaching Elders, for the extent of their Rule and their Preaching is all one. And of Ruling Elders he speaks, ver. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you; for they watch for your Souls, as those that must give an account.</hi> And not to Dispute, whether these places note out two sorts
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:154381:99"/> of Officers, Preaching Elders, <hi>v.</hi> 7. and Ruling Elders, <hi>v.</hi> 17. Or but one sort, and so but seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts of the same Office; yet this is certain that these are commensurable; for they are Officers together in the same Church: And if the Pastor's power of Ruling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends no further than his Preaching, then the meer Ruling Elders power, or his that is assistant to him, must extend no further also. 1. Remember those that have spoken the word to you. 2. Obey and Submit to those that watch for your Souls. This is the Natural Obligation to Obedience, and so is the measure to set the bounds of the extent of ordinary Church-power. 'Tis one Argument used against Episcopal power, that they are enforced to obey him that speaks not the Word to them, nor watcheth over their Souls; and this holds as well against these Presbyterial Offices; and when a Man comes before such to be Excommunicated, he may say, I am not bound to obey you in such an Authoritative way, nor do I owe a Subjection as to a power of Censure in you; for many, nay most of you, have never spoke the word to me, nor do watch over my Soul: Nay, perhaps the Man can say, he never saw their Faces afore. And it avails not to say, that they they may occasionally Preach; for the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. speaking of res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to their Officers, <hi>Know them</hi> (says he) <hi>that Labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and Admonish you.</hi> These two, Those that Labour, and are over you, are commensurable, and <hi>they</hi> are meant, who make it their callings to have the care of the Flock, which the many Pastors and Elders in a common Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry do not. But in what is it they Labour, the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. expounds it to be, <hi>That Labour in the Word and Doctrine; The Elders that Rule well, as worthy of double Honour, especially those that Labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> And whether you expound this latter known place of Teaching Elders only, or of Ruling and Teaching both (as the Reformed Churches do) however it affords this to us, that the extent of Ruling, in either the one or the other, is but as large as Teaching. And if it be meant of Teaching Elders only, that both Rule and Labour in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; yet if they be limited in labouring in the Word, as being fixt Pastors to their own Congregations, then in Ruling also. And if it be meant of Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders (as distinct from them) yet their Ruling is of the same extent, that the others labouring in the Word; and that is extended but to one Congregation, whereas Pastors they are fixed. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though in a Pastor's Office, in which Preaching and Ruling is joyned, yet his power of Ruling flows in him from, and is the Adjunct of his power to Preach; and to be sure, it is not extendable further. And however, yet there is the same proportion of either; and then by just Reason, the extent of the Church, which is the Subject of his ordinary Ruling, cannot be extended larger than what is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Subject of his Preaching, and so those Relations are of equal limits, (which is the present case of a Pastor's Authority, appropriated to a Congregation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended but to his own in an ordinary way) and to make the ground of a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on narrower, than the extent of it is absurd. If a Father hath the power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning as a Father, then it is extendable only to those he is a Father to. And that a Pastor hath his ordinary Ruling power, annexed to his ordinary power of Preaching, we prove by these Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If he hath no this Ruling power upon this ground, then must be assigned some other. He hath it not by any special Faculty or Office, over and above this of Preaching; for then he should be made a Ruling Elder, over and above his being first a Preaching Elder, as a new Faculty given him: Nor hath he it by being made a Ruler first, and then having this of Preaching Superadded (as the Bishops first made Deacons, then Presbyters.) For</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the Keys are given him at once, the Keys of Ruling, with the Keys of Knowledge. The power of the Staff intrinsecally follows, his being a Pastor or Shepherd; and though the one is a power of meer Order, Namely that of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that of his Ruling is of Jurisdiction (to be exercised in many cases with others, and not alone) yet still his receiving power to joyn with others in those Acts of Rule of Jurisdiction, is from this power of Order; and the ordinary extent of his Authority therein, is extended no further than his ordinary call to Preaching. Yea,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:154381:99"/> 3. The extent of the power of the Apostles themselves, in Ruling in all the Churches, was founded upon, and extendable with their Commission to Preach; and their very Call and Obligation being not to Preach in a set and fixt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as an ordinary Pastor's calling is; but to all Nations, and in all Churches, hence their power of Ruling was answerable. It was their very Call to be Universal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and therefore Universal Rulers; Yea, and their Authority of Ruling, was narrower in the extent of it, than of their Preaching. The Apostles might preach to Heathens, and their Call was so to do, to convert them; but they had not power to Rule all Men, <hi>What have I to do to Judge them that are without?</hi> says the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12. But in this way of Presbyterial Government, though they also may occasionally Preach, where they may not Rule; yet the proportion of their ordinary Ruling, is extended beyond the proportion of their ordinary Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was not so in the Apostles themselves. Let but the same Line of proportion equally be drawn over the Apostle's power in these and theirs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their several measures. Their Call to Ruling, was Uniform to Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all Churches, though their Preaching was larger than their Rule, Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to those without; but ordinary Pastors have a standing fixt Call to Preach, but in one Congregation; let their Call and power of Ruling, be Uniform to it, and they can have an ordinary standing power to Rule, but in that Congregation; either extend both further, or contract both to this. It is no answer, to say that they may Preach as Pastors in Neighbour Churches occasionally; for so they may Preach to any Reformed Church, as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where yet they have not so much as an occasional Call to Rule, and in such occasional Acts of Preaching also, they have but the proportion, which the Apostles had, whose power in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was larger than of Ruling; for it was extended to them without. But still if an ordinary standing power in Ruling, although with others (for the Apostles exercised their power with others) should be stretcht where they have not an ordinary standing Call to Preach, it should exceed the proportion of the Apostles in that respect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And Fourthly, From hence ariseth another Disproportion between these Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, Ruling and Preaching Elders, compared among themselves; and it is such a Disproportion, as is like to the former, alledged between the Deacons and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. For this Government makes the extent of the Ruling Elders Office and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to be larger than that of the Teachers or Pastors: For the Pastor as Pastor, is limited to his particular Congregation he is fixt to, as the Deacons also are: But the Ruling Elders Office, as Ruling Elder, is extended over all these Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this Presbytery. The Ruling Elder performs his Office, in the highest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it, as to Admonish, Excommunicate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to all in these Churches; but the Pastors are limited as Pastors, in the Highest Work of their Callings (which preaching is; and more excellent than Ruling, yea, than Baptizing) unto one Congregation. That place in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. (interpret how you will) Justifies what is asserted.</p>
                  <p>Now these are strange Disproportions, which are occasioned by this and the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Government. And this greatly makes for the Congregational way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as to these particulars, no such Incongruities are found, but all things fall natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Uniform.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Second Head of Incongruities and Inconsistencies, which will follow upon this Government, concerns the Mutual Duties required, that do necessarily follow upon this standing Relation, for a constant Government of these Elders, to all this people of these Churches, and of the people to these Elders.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The people of all these Elders (according to what the Scripture speaks of, as due to standing Elders) owe at least Honour and Esteem to them; yea, Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to all of them, whether they ordinarily Rule them, or Preach to them; and they owe it on both accounts, 1 Tim. 4. 17, 18. <hi>Let the Elders that Rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour, especially that Labour in the Word and Doctrine;</hi> Which Honour is, <hi>(ver.</hi> 18.) in the Analogy of that Law, <hi>Not to Muzzle the Mouth of the Ox, that treadeth out the Corn:</hi> And this is certainly due to Elders, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what is the Work of Elders, whether performed apart or together, by way of Jurisdiction. And it cannot be denyed, but that their constant Ruling, as in the Presbytery, is one great part of the Work of Elders, here intended and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:154381:100"/> with Preaching, for which an especial Honour is due. God appoints no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant work in the Ministry, but he appoints a Reward from those, for whom it is performed. And as they owe a Duty of Ruling to every one in the Flock, as <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. So there is a due of Maintenance and Honour, due from all this people, to all and every one of those Elders, to those that Rule, as well as to those that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Word and Doctrine. And in Reason, if the Elders that Rule well, and perform the lesser Acts of Ruling in their particular Congregations, are to have this Honour from them, in their Relations; then all these Elders that Rule well in the common Presbytery, and perform the greatest Acts of Ruling, are to have the like from all of that classical Church; for the Emphasis being put upon <hi>Ruling well,</hi> and in those Acts done by them, the Excellency of Ruling consisting; therefore to these, is this Honour due from this Great Church, more especially, than from the lesser Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, Respectively unto their proper Elders. Neither will the Distinction of being a Presbytery in common salve it; for if the particular Elders of Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are to have this Honour for what is done by them in their joynt Acts of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the particular Presbyteries; then these are to have it in what is done in their common Presbyteries also. And the precept is, not to Honour Presbyteries in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in an abstract Notion, but to Honour Elders; because the particular persons of the Elders, are to be the Object of it; and those most, who excell most in that Rule, <hi>that Rule well, or best.</hi> But when there are many Congregations apart, who have their proper fixt Pastors and Elders, whom they maintain for performing one part of the Elders work (for they perform but one part of it) how shall they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this due to all the rest, for that other part of the work? How Burthensome, how confused would this be? And yet due it is, for they are all one Church to them. And then how can this Duty be proportioned (suppose it should not be Maintenance, but Honour and Esteem) for the people will not be able well to judge of it, not only because they cannot be present at their Work, and so cannot judge of it; but because either it must be proportioned to them that are constant, as Preaching Elders, or as Ruling. For the ground it is there, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 18.) required upon is, that they tread out their Corn, and the Apostle says, <hi>Esteem them for their Work sake, that Labour among you,</hi> 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12, 13. So as it is to be proportioned to the Work of a Pastor, as Pastor; but to Honour or Esteem them as Ruling Elders only, were to Honour the Preaching Elders, below the Rank and Degree of their Office.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It also brings the like Incongruity, upon the performance of those Duties of Elders, which the New Testament indifferently requires of all those that it acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be Elders unto a people; and therefore no such constant Relation of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to so many Churches may be. 1. One Duty is praying with the Sick, <hi>Send for the Elders of the Church, to pray for them,</hi> Jam. 5. 14. What! are these Elders of the Presbyterial Church bound to this? And this Duty lies in common upon Elders of the Churches; and how shall we Distinguish, when the Scripture doth not? 2. Another Duty is visiting from House to House, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his Example instructs the Elders of <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20. 2. 3. Another Duty is watching over Men's Souls, as those that must give an account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. and that the people should <hi>obey them;</hi> and no Warrant is given to obey others in the way of an ordinary Rule. And to watch, is not to stay till causes are brought by Appeals, or so, from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; but personally to watch <hi>over them,</hi> as Souls committed to them. 4. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Duty is Preaching (if they be Preaching Elders) in Season, and out of Season. The Bishops said, the Flock was theirs, and the whole care committed to them; and to Salve the Incongruity, of not being able to preach themselves to them all, they professed a Derivative delegated Power to Inferior Pastors, whom they called their Curates. This was plain dealing; but these Elders make all the whole Flock theirs, and this from those Scriptures, that speak of Elders and Flock; and yet themselves have no Curates, and so are personally obliged according to the Rules in Scripture, and yet cannot perform the obligation, which is a worse Incongruity. 5. It will be their Duty also, to attend to all causes, which so many Churches will fill their Hands with sufficiently; for Churches will be full of Scandal, and there will be cases of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. What a deal of Work, did one Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> find <hi>Paul?</hi> And 'tis the Duty of each Elder, to attend to all those that come in his cognisance, as if he alone were to Judge; for he is to give his Judgment of them all, as one that is to give an
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:154381:100"/> account. 'Tis an Argument against Episcopacy, that they cannot take the care (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Scripture seems to require of an ordinary Officer) of so many Churches in a Diocess; now this Work (suppose of Ruling only, as in a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) lies upon each of these Elders, as if he were but one, as to the matters of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereto (as was said) though each is helped by the Suggestion of others. And besides the common Work that must needs arise from all these Churches, they are to attend to all cases of Conscience, and of Temptations, in their particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, or from elsewhere, if those Churches will have Recourse to them. If it be said, that they may part these Duties among them, and perform only to the whole, those that are in common: The answer is plain, <hi>Ʋbi Scriptura non distinguit, nec nos debemus distinguere, Where the Scripture makes no Distinction, we ought not to Distinguish.</hi> Now all those Duties are spoken of, as owing from Elders to the Flock, without any Distinction. <hi>Paul</hi> saith to those <hi>Ephesians, Feed the whole Flock,</hi> Acts 20. 28. <hi>Peter</hi> says the like to those he Writes to, that they Respectively should Feed, and take the oversight over the Flock, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which was among them. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles tells the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that their Elders watched over their Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> he Describes them to be those that are over them, and Labour and Admonish them, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. When these Injunctions are thus laid upon all, how shall the Conscience of Elders be able to part and distinguish themselves out of the discharge of them, and to say, though I am an Elder in common to all in these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; yet I am bound but to govern them in greater matters, and to Admonish them as with others, when publickly met in a consistory, and to no other Acts of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dership; and yet to my own particular Congregation, I am obliged to private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, Rule and Watchfulness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where hath the Scripture set these bounds, or thus parted them? Therefore certainly all these places hold forth singly, only the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of a particular Church fixed thereto, and their Duty to it, as knowing no other. And indeed it was necessary that Christ should set the bounds, and give the Distinction, and not indifferently lay all these Duties upon all: And either in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Duties of Elders in a common Presbytery are contained, or they are not to be found in the New Testament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> That which is Inconsistent with the ordinary way of the Call of Elders held forth in the Word, and by the Reformed Churches allowed. <hi>May not be:</hi> But such is this Presbyterian Government. It is the Call, which breeds Relation between Elders and Church, and is the Foundation of it. None are to assume the Honour of Ruling the Church of Christ, that are not called thereto, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was not to have been over all the Church, but that he was called of God.</p>
                  <p>There are two parts of this Calling, 1. Choice. 2. Ordination.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for Choice, <hi>Chamier</hi> in the Name of all the Reformed Churches, allows to the People, the Approbation of their Elders; and so it is in <hi>Scotland.</hi> And if the Apostles themselves, allowed them the choice of the Deacons that had the charge of the Church Treasury, and took care of their Bodies; then much more of their Elders that have to do with their Consciences. Look what ever Right of the People, is in the choice of those who should preach to them, there is as much Reason they should have the exercise of it in the choice of these, that in a common Presbytery do Rule over them; for they perform one part of the Elders Duty, Namely Ruling, as the preaching Elders do the other; and therefore by the equity of the same Law, that speaks of Elders indefinitely, if they choose any Elders as Elders to them, they are to choose these also, there being no Distinction put of choosing preaching Elders on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Elders indefinitely. And further, the greatest and highest Acts of power over them, are committed in an ordinary way unto them, as of Excommunication, which is of all punishments, the most Formidable, and so there is put as much, if not more than every Mans Life (that is a Member of that classical Church) into their Hands. The enjoyment of all Ordinances for ever, and the power of Deposing their Ministers, already fixt to them, and the power of Refusing to ordain them they shall approve, is lodged in this classis. And therefore in the Primitive Church, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Bishops, who had the power of all these, were chosen by all the people, and by panegyrical Meetings.</p>
                  <p>And the Argument is strengthned by this further parallel. A Minister's call hath two parts, 1. Ordination, which belongs to the Elders, 2. Choice, in which the people have some interest; therefore these Elders as Elders in common, and these
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:154381:101"/> Congregations as one Church, being Relatives, that interest which a Church hath as Church, is commensurable to the interest of these Elders as Elders. If therefore in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, all the Elders in a common Presbytery, joyn to Ordain an Officer; then all the people as a Church, must joyn in choosing and approving him; for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right of choosing, cannot be swallowed up by the interest of their Elders Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining him. And if it be said, they all choose by vertue of the general Law of Combination, as in the Shires they do Parliament Men: It is answered, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the State makes it so, and if the like be found in Scripture for this other, it will be sufficient; but if not, but that this interest must be common to the people of the classical Church, it is asked, when a fixt Pastor is to be chosen to a particular Church, what Office he shall be chosen to, with respect unto the people of the other Congregations? Not to a Pastor's Office; for he is not to be such to them: If he be chosen to be a Ruling Elder only, then besides that he hath two Offices, he must have two choices, and two Ordinations; we choose him for our Pastor, says the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church he belongs to; and we, say the other, to Rule us. And besides the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have an interest of presence, and joyning in Fasting and Prayer, at his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And this therefore must be performed either in a panegyrical Meeting of all, which cannot be as the practice is, or in all the several Churches, which will multiply the Ordination of him.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Concerning Appeals. That they are not absolutely necessary to the Government of the Churches.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THAT Appeals are not of absolute necessity to the Government of the Churches; and that the Law of Nature doth not necessarily require them, is apparent from these Reasons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the first Government under the Law of Nature, there were no Appeals in Criminal causes: But <hi>Judah</hi> the Head of his Family, peremptorily pronounceth the Sentence, <hi>Let her be burnt, Gen.</hi> 38. And indeed, to whom then should any Appeal have been made? Therefore Appeals are not necessary by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:154381:102"/> 2. The Law of Nature among the <hi>Jews,</hi> required them not. The Government was in the Cities, and no Appeals (in <hi>Deut</hi> 17. or elsewhere) in case of wrong, were made by the Injured party; but only in case of Difficulty, they had Recourse to the Judgment of the Great <hi>Synhedrim,</hi> to Resolve cases that were too hard for them. And as for that instance of <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 18. 22. that the great matters were brought to him, and the small matters to other Elders, it was a dividing of causes, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their sort and kind, and not a bringing of matters by way of Appeal unto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some of the Reformed Churches have no Appeals, and yet are well governed; and in as much peace as those in <hi>Scotland.</hi> In <hi>Geneva,</hi> there is but one Consistory; and if there be any Appeals in case of Male-Administration, they are made to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. And if it be said that it is so, because they being a Common wealth, and having Supream power, do bound the Church power: Yet still however, if the power of this our Government would appoint Magistrates to hear Appeals of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches, and so bound their power in themselves (as the Imperial Towns in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> or the <hi>Cantons</hi> in <hi>Switzerland</hi> do) there is a great possibility to Govern these Churches, without any other or further Appeals, in case of unjust Sentences, as well as <hi>Geneva,</hi> and other Reformed Churches are Governed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In matters of Life and Death in this Kingdom, there is no Appeals, not such as to Right the Man if wronged; but every Corporation hath the priviledge touching the Execution of the Man, to do it within themselves; and yet if in any thing, <hi>De morte hominis deliberandum est, There is the greatest Deliberation to be had about the Life and Death of a Man;</hi> and yet this way of proceeding without Appeals, in such a case as this, is not against the Law of Nature.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In Democracies, where the Sentence of Life and Death (as in many cases it was so) were referred to the immediate Sentence of the people, there were no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals; and yet such a Government, is not against the light of Nature. Now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of a Mans Life, may well be conceived to be of as much moment, as casting a Man out of a Church; for that deprives the Subject of all Ordinances for ever, and also of further time to Repent; and yet Incorporations and a Recorder, are betrusted with this, without the ordinary benefit of Appeals to relieve the Man; and therefore why may not a Church, a company of Saints, that hath the promise of Christ's presence to guide them, and which is a Body to Christ, being sufficiently furnished with Officers, having two or three Elders over them, be as well betrusted in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick Administrations? Nor can it be supposed, that God should take more care un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament, for Relief of wrongs in Churches scattered, than he did in that National Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which (as a Nation) was capable of Appeals: Or that God for the pretended Relief of particular persons wronged, should Subject whole Churches, yea, Provinces to a coercive power, armed with the dreadful▪Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, in a National Assembly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Appeals are not absolutely necessary, is evident, because, if they were so, they should be brought either antecedently to the Sentence of Excommunication in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, or after it hath past on the person-Excommunicated.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But that an Appeal should not go before the Sentence of Excommunication, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the power and duty of that Court, to which the persons cause is first brought. The Congregation that is told of the persons Sin (according to Christ's Institution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 17.) hath the power of the censures; and Christ's command lies upon them, to execute Christs Ordinance, if he hears not that Church to whom the Accusation of him is first brought; whereas by an Appeal afore, the Sentence would be Suspended, and so it would be in the power of an obstinate Sinner, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sentence from coming into Act.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is apparent from the good of the person. For 1. If an Appeal was thus brought antecedent to the Sentence of Excommunication past in a particular Church, then a Man should never be obstinate, until he came to the National Assembly, and so he would want the means of his conversion all that while, which would be the ready way to harden him in his Sin, to defer his Repentance at least for a year; and then he must run through all the same course of Admonitions by the higher Courts, ere they can pronounce the Sentence. 2. Then God must wait upon, and lackey after
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:154381:102"/> Men, and Suspend a Sentence, till a Man hath gone through all these Courts on Earth, and baffled both God's Sentence, and also Man's.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Appeals are not to be made, after the Sentence of Excommunication past in a particular Church, appears,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Nature of the Sentence, which is decisive, and is irreversible, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound in Heaven, unless the person Repents, and upon his Repentance, is resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because a particular Church, by yielding to such Appeals, would give up that Power and Authority, with which Christ hath intrusted them. For Christ hath given them full power to exercise all Acts of Discipline within themselves (as hath been proved) but if they admitted of Appeals to be made to a Superior Court, as having power over them, to Disanull their Acts; they would thereby acknowledge a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, and that they had not the perfect power in themselves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there may be such Appeals, whether afore or after Sentence (other than to relieve the Person, and those we grant) then there should be a greater punishment for the Appellant, if he be cast in the provincial Assembly, and yet a greater also than <hi>that,</hi> if he be again cast in the National. So it is in civil Courts, and it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves it here as much as in any; for a Man becomes Guilty of a greater Sin, by so Appealing (if indeed he is criminal) for he is guilty of more obstinacy; if the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal be afore the Sentence, by hindring it, if after, by continuing more impudently impenitent; and in both cases, in troubling all the Churches. But these Courts have no greater punishment to inflict, than what the Congregation or first Church hath; for the Man is by Excommunication, out of his own Church, cast out of all Churches, as well as when cast by the National. They can only Admonish, and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate at last, if the Sentence be not past afore the Appeal, or if the Appeal be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Sentence, they can only pronounce the Sentence to be just, they have no further or more grievous Excommunication for him. There is indeed a final Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with a curse, <hi>Anathema, Maranatha,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22.) to him that loves not (which is a Diminutive) that is, that shews Hatred against the Lord Christ, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inlightning; and so hath sinned against the Holy Ghost: But we believe that such an Excommunication, is not that which upon Appeals to the National Assembly (if the Person be cast there also) they shall have power to inflict. In the case indeed of Eternal Damnation, every Degree for every Sin, is another Hell added to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (not an increase of Torment by a circumstance, but Substantially) but it is not so here; for every new Sentence of these gradual Courts, add not a new Degree of Excommunication. Whereas Excommunication is a giving up to Satan; if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation Excommunicating gave up to one Devil, and the classical to more, and the Provincial Assembly to more; and then the National to worse than the former (as in the Gospel Christ says of a Man apostatizing, that seven Devils worse than before, enter into the Man) then these Courts might Arrogate such Appeals to them, and proportionably punish the Person's obstinacy, who wrongfully makes them, but the case is otherwise. If it be Replyed, that the shame is increased, that he is Rebuked by so many, and <hi>that</hi> is a punishment; and that as Christ's Death is aggravated by the shame, so here the Excommunication is made the more shameful in the National, than it would have been in the lesser Assembly: The Answer is, 1. That still that which is of the Substance of this Spiritual punishment, and which is Spiritual in it, and in which the Spirit of it lies, is not, nor cannot be added unto; <hi>viz.</hi> God's bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Man in Heaven, which God did, and doth as much upon the first Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as upon the second or third; and as for Satan's power to Terrifie him, he is as much delivered thereby to it, and he is as much cast out of the Ordinances in all Churches by it, as by the confirmation of the Sentence in the National Assembly. And what is that outward shame of it (such as follows upon all other civil Crimes, made publick) to be compared with these, or to correspond to that further proportion of Authority, that these Higher Courts, by challenging of Appeals to be made to them, do seem to usurp, as if an answerable degree of Spiritual punishment, were by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise Ministred in them? And if there should not be a further punishment unto the Appellant, then it comes all to one, with what we affirm; for if it be in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the party only, we acknowledge Appeals in those respects, to be useful to, by declaring the Sentence Null, and that there was no due or just Excommunication. And if it be a just Sentence, we acknowledge Appeals so far to be made to Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Churches,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:154381:103"/> that they may declare it is a just Excommunication already past: So that what we contend against, is this, when under the colour of Appeals, they challenge to themselves a Juridical power, to Rescind Sentences, to have the power of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, as much as the Churches that do Excommunicate, to oppose or stop any Church inferior, from proceeding; and in a Reverence to this their power, to give liberty to any Person offending, to Appeal before Sentence unto them to judge of it, and to pronounce it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The liberty of such Appeals, afore or after Sentence, through all those gradual Remedies, of Classical, Provincial, National (which we conceive should be rather for matters of Doctrine, than for the Relief of Persons of all sorts; and they should deal in generals, rather than in such particulars, as themselves are more General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies) will breed great inconveniences. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Either the lower Churches must spare many gross Offenders in a Nation, that there may be few Excommunications, and so prevent occasions of Appeals (and then they would not take away the Dishonour done to Christ, by multitude of Scandals) or else if the lower Churches be Faithful in proceeding against all such Offenders; yet by setting up three such Courts over them for gradual Appeals, with liberty to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to them, there will, instead of Relieving particular Persons, be occasioned the greatest Trouble and Cumber to these Assemblies in Multitudes of causes depending; for who will not Appeal, knowing at last he can be but Excommunicated? And they must dispatch these causes either by Committees only (and so to do, is to Reduce the Supream Judgment to a fewer company of Elders, than were in the first Classis or Provincial Synods, that judged it; besides that, it is a meer Delegated power, which such Committees exercise) or else they must trust the lower Courts wholly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to their Sentence; and then to what end are such Appeals? Surely the Highest National Court, cannot deny to hear any Man that Appeals to them, and if they will hear all that will Appeal, they will be filled with them; and that will prove vexatious, both to the Persons, and Churches Appealing, and will be impossible to be dispatcht. And besides, no Man being to be Excommunicated, but upon impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency, which may be where the Fact is acknowledged and confessed, and yet the Church not satisfied with the Repentance (for an undue outward formal confession, will easily be acknowledged not to be that upon which Churches should forbear Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, in case the Fact be Scandalous, it being a Godly sorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9, 10. that is required of Men in such a case) may therefore proceed justly to Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they judge, that he Repents not, though the Appealer says he doth Repent; and then the Trial will be of the Man's Repentance, performed at his Confession, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Godly or no, which how can any judge of, but upon their own having seen it, or putting the Man to a new Repentance afresh, upon a Reiterated admonition by them; and how then will a National Assembly so easily be able to judge of it? And if they could, yet if they hear all things as fully over again, as all the Inferior Courts did (or how shall they judge to the satisfaction of the Appellant?) What work would this create to all such Assemblies? It was objected against the Bishop's Extensive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, over so many Congregations, that they had more Churches, and so more Business to come before them, than any one Man could, or themselves did manage; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had their Arch-Deacons and Chancellors, and the like under them: But a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Assembly will have much more to do; and yet it sits not as the <hi>Synhedrim</hi> all the year, but only a few weeks. To Discourage Men from those Appeals, at last by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if cast, is to eke out the Spiritual power with the Temporal. A suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Spiritual Remedy is sought for, and it must be within it self; for that of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, is but External, though helpful, and we seek a sufficient Government, that was in the Primitive Times, when there were no Christian Magistrates.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such National Assemblies in a due proportion, should rather have work suited to their constitution, <hi>viz.</hi> National Reformation, and Advices to the Magistrate about that which is common to all Churches in the Nation (and they will find enough of it in all times) than every Man's personal cause by way of Appeal (that hath a mind to Appeal) to come afore them: Even as civil Assemblies, Parliaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ordinary Appeals from all Courts in this Kingdom; but leave them to these Courts, the Kingdom affording matters of far greater Moment for their Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:154381:103"/> 3. These Appeals still being made from one Ecclesiastical Court to another, and those Superior (when the cause is out of the Congregations Hands) consisting most of Pastors, or if of others, yet of Persons Ecclesiastical (for as such they sit in those Assemblies, being Homogenial Members of Presbyteries, and lay Elders you will not call them) by this means all causes are taken up into the Clergies Hands, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from the People; and the Clergy will take part one with another, and the one Ratifie what the lower hath done, as the High Commission did what a particular Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop had done, against an inferior Minister or other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When the cause comes to the National Assembly, whose power is purely Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, either the Appeals must rest here, and go no further; and the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, if he back their Sentence with a civil Mulct, must, without his examining of the cause, judge as they have Determined it; and so the Temporal Power must pursue, and execute the Decrees of the Spiritual, by an implicit Faith (which was the Bondage the Secular Powers were in, unto the Popish Bishops in those Times.) Or else they also must take full cognisance of the cause, and have a power to Redress and Rectifie the wrong, if they find all these Courts to have injured a Person, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps differing in Judgment, or the like: And then it must either be the Supream power, the High Court of Parliament (and then that Honourable Court, must be fill'd with all Mens Ecclesiastical Appeals) or it must be some lesser ordinary Court of Magistracy inferior, which shall have power to correct the wrong; and we believe the National Assembly, will very hardly Subject their Sentence to their power, to Rescind and Declare it to be Unjust, so as to be bound by the Magistrates power on them to recall it; and yet otherwise, it is in vain to appeal at all to the Magistrate. One of these ways must be taken, or else the civil Magistrates must be denyed to have appeals in such cases brought to them; but all be left in the Churches Hands, and the benefit of Appeals made to them altogether, be cut off.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If the King and Parliament should in the Judgment of the National Assembly, aggrieve you in point of Religion, may appeals be made to the National Assembly therein? Will you appeal to the National Assembly against them? Whether our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will not decline that answer that was given by one of the Brethren in the Debate, <hi>Why should we be afraid to affirm they might Appeal to them,</hi> we know not; but we cannot see how the Principles of the Presbyterial Government, can avoid the asserting of it. Surely that Independency so opprobriously ascribed to us, and retorted on us, is with Submission to the Magistrate; and an Obedience by suffrage, without appealing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we professing not to know any Spiritual power on Earth, to which an Appeal may be made from the Sentence of the Magistrate, especially if it be the Supream Authoritative Magistrate. Though we acknowledge a Relation to no other Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Authority, that hath a coercive power, <hi>Sub paenae Excommunicationis,</hi> or of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering unto Satan; yet we own a Subjection to an Assembly of other Churches, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is; and that as to an Ordinance of Christ. But now to set up a National Assembly, growing up from the Ecclesiastical State, as a Court to whom Appeals may be made from the Sentence of the Supream Magistrate it self, is so Transcendent a way of Independency, not Negatively only, as knowing no Superior; but affirmatively also, Subjecting the civil power to the Church, as the other deserves not the Name of it. And if from the civil power, Appeals may be made to such Assemblies; then they have the Authority over it, such as under the Notion of Appeals is contended for. They will have a power to Convent, yea, to Excommunicate, and that as a joynt Body or Parliament.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>What power Synods composed of the Elders of particular Churches occasionally assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, have in case of Male-Administrations, by any particular Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS we acknowledge elective occasional Synods of the Elders of many Churches, as the Churches have need to refer cases of difference to them: So in case of Male-Administration, or an unjust proceeding, in the Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the like we acknowledge Appeals or Complaints may be made to other Churches; and the Elders of those Churches met in a Synod, who being offended, may as an Ordinance of Christ, Judge and Declare that Sentence to be Null, Void, and Unjust; and that not simply, as any company of Men may so Judge, giving their Judgments of a Fact done; but as an Ordinance of Christ in such cases, and for that end, Sanctified by him to Judge and Declare in matters of Difference. And the Church and Eldership of a particular Church, that proceedeth so unjustly, ought to look at this their Determination, as an Ordinance of Christ to them; and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it as such, more sadly to review their own Act and Proceedings, to consider the grounds which the Synod gives why it is unjust, and themselves ought to acknowledge it such, and receive the Brother again with acknowledgment of their Sin, and of the wrong done him: Yet not with an Implicit Faith, because the Synod hath so Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, as having a greater power from Christ to Restore the Man.</p>
                  <p>In case this Church will not own this Petson thus wrongfully Ejected; these Churches, or any of them, upon this Determination of their Elders (the Churches at their return approving their Sentence) may both receive the party in among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and so Relieve the Man; and further also profess to hold no Communion with that Church, if they perceive that Church doth continue obstinate, having either for the manner proceeded therein, against the common principles of Equity and Right (such as in Judging of matters of Fact, civil Courts proceed by, as when mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not sufficiently proved, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> or against, and besides the Principles whereby Churches are to proceed (as for the matter of Excommunication it self) which that Church it self hath, and doth hold forth and profess.</p>
                  <p>If it fall out that a Person be thus cast, first by his own Church, and now by a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of many Churches, to whom he Referred his cause, and appealed, he is bound rather to sit down, than <hi>Cursitare</hi> (as <hi>Cyprians</hi> word and advice is) <hi>run up and down,</hi> still to other and greater number of Churches, and to suffer wrong rather (as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. the Apostle in another case exhorts) than engage Churches against Churches (which may prove the event) in his own private quarrel.</p>
                  <p>In Christian Commonwealths, Appeals may be made in all such cases of wrong to the Magistrate, as to the other Churches, the Subject matter of Excommunication, being but such things as are against the common profession of Christianity, in Doctrine and Manners, and (not the niceties and curiosities in Theology) and such as the Laws of the Magistrate approve of; and the manner of proceeding for the proof of the Fact, being the same that are to be in all other Courts civil.</p>
                  <p>Now these things being premised and acknowledged by us; we proceed to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative part, what power we deny to Synods in point of Male-Administrations, which our Brethren would give them, and herein the points in difference are three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We deny them to have power to Rescind a Sentence, but only Doctrinally to Judge a Sentence of Excommunication, to be void and unjust. Now <hi>the power to Rescind a Sentence,</hi> according to the acceptation of the words imports, 1. An Act of the same kind of Ministerial power, that gave the Sentence: It imports the same pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make it void, that did establish it; yea, a power containing in it all that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior hath, and is withal Superior to it. The Christian Magistrate hath a power over Churches, in case of wrong, not only to declare the Sentence to be unjust, as he is a Christian Magistrate, but to cause that Church that pronounced it, to Revoke it as such; but yet the Assembly will not, that they have power to Rescind the Sentence, as they say Synods may. Therefore this word (as in Synods the Assembly would place the power of it) must import not simply power of Judging and Declaring the Sentence unjust; for that is refused, but further, a power of the same kind, and yet
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:154381:104"/> Superior, by vertue of which the Sentence is made void, <hi>Coram Ecclesia,</hi> before the Church, and is now so to be conceived of all. And as in the Act of the Church that Excommunicated the Man, there was a further power put forth, than a bare Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that he was to be Excommunicated; for they actually, with the power of Christ, did cast out, and deliver the Man to Satan: So here in this Act that bears the Name of Rescinding, there must be supposed a power, not simply to declare the Sentence unjust; but further, a power upon their Sentence, to make void the other's Act, that the Person before Excommunicated, stands now <hi>Coram Ecclesia,</hi> Unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Second power which we deny to Synods, which is contended for by our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which also the word <hi>Rescind</hi> imports, is the like coercive power in this Synod given them by Christ, whereby to compel this Church to acknowledge their Sentence unjust, and to Receive that Brother again. And the punishment by which they are enabled to compel them to it, must be of the same kind with that which these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed inferior Churches have over their Members, if they did not obey; Namely, to Excommunicate and deliver up to Satan that Church, Classis, or Province, that hath thus unjustly proceeded; and will not receive this Man in again, upon their Rescind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. And this it imports in the Sense of our Brethren, for otherwise they do but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>that</hi> Government in these cases to be in Synods, which we the Dissenting Brethren contend for; which is, that these Synods, and the Churches under them, may in some cases withdraw Communion from other Churches offending, but not presume to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, or deliver them to Satan, or Unchurch them; and lay a Law upon their Consciences, to shut up their Church-Meetings, and to be all Heathens and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans to one another, as well as to the Synod and their Churches. And yet this which we contend for, is cryed down with this common prejudice, that it is no Government, because this power of Excommunication is wanting. Again, when they Restore the Party wronged, is it to their Communion only, or to the Communion with that Church, out of which he was Excommunicated also? If only to their own, then still it is no more than what we acknowledge Neighbour Churches may do, in case of wrong; and it is a Relief to the party. But if also they have power to Restore him to the Church he was cast out of actually; then they must have power to compel that Church to receive him. In this case these whole Churches and their Officers, would be Subjects to be dealt with by these Synods; For 1. The appellant wronged is one party, and they another. And 2. The Excommunication was a publick Church Act, wherein the Elders and the People are involved, especially when they all stand to own him, and to execute the Sentence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Third thing wherein we differ, is concerning matters of Appeals. We ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them as importing, in the Sense of our Brethren, a Juridical Superior power, in the Superior Synods to be appealed unto. Concerning which we say, 1. That such appeals are not so absolutely necessary to the Government of the Churches, nor doth the Law of Nature necessarily require them: 2. Especially not such appeals as should acknowledge a Superior power in the Synod appealed unto, either by making the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal afore the Sentence is given in particular Churches, and so the matter is taken out of their Hands, by vertue of a Superior in Synods, or by making the appeal after Sentence given, we deny them to be such fixed and solemn Courts of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>First, As for that Rescinding power pretended, if more than Declarative is intended, we conceive that the Nature of the Sentence of Excommunication, when untimely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted is such, that by what ever Court (that is the first Subject of pronouncing it) it is pronounced and executed, it is not capable of being Rescinded. It is capable of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Void, Null, or Unjust; but not of being Rescinded, in the Sense afore explained, in matterts civil, one Court having a Superior power, may in a true and proper Sense, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scind the Sentence of another; because it hath a greater power of the same kind, by vertue of which, it can make that Act void, which stood before by vertue of the inferior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as valid, each Act depending upon that power, which on Earth is set up; and so the greater may undo, and Reverse what the former did. But thus to Rescind a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, no power on Earth is able to do. Which is evinced thus.</p>
                  <p>There are two parts of that Sentence, one outward, which the Church performs (which is Ejection out of Communion.) The other inward, which God accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:154381:105"/> the Sentence with. And if the Sentence were formally no more but a casting out of the outward communion of the Church on Earth, then a greater power in Earth, might have power to Rescind their Sentence, and Restore him to communion; but there is a further Judicial Act annexed unto it, which is binding in Heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to Satan, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which must be supposed such a special Judicial Act of God; some Men's Sin is in some Sense bound in Heaven, till he Repents, when he commits it, and is Admonished by any Christian, whether he be in the Church or no, and whether he be brought before the Church or no for it; and so the Brethren that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him in order to Excommunication, may be said in some Sense, to bind his Sin. But there is a further Judicial Act of God's put forth, when the Church hath Ministerially Sentenced the Man aright; for the Church so binds Sin, as no private Brother can; or else it might be said, that a Brother may deliver to Satan. Hence that Assembly, which is the first Subject of this power from God, hath the promise of this, and God is supposed by us, to have performed it upon their Sentence; and then it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble there should be a Superior power of the same kind on Earth to Rescind it, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bind it in Heaven, and to whom a further promise is made, that when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it void, there is an unbinding in Heaven. So as suppose the Congregational or Classical Church (be it either the one or the other, that is acknowledged the first Subject of this power, and which of these should be, could never yet be brought to the Debate) hath bound the Man; and the Provincial confirms it, and binds him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: If the National hath power to Rescind this, it hath then one Key to unloose what these three Keys have lockt. The answer to this is only, that this Argument goes upon a false Supposition, that appeals should be, when the Excommunication is just, whereas they are only when the appeal is unjust, and so the Sin is not bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. To which it is Replyed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In case of appeals. That's the thing still in question between the Parties, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be just or unjust? And therefore to suppose that all appeals fall out only in cases of real unjustice and wrong, cannot be a sufficient answer. Yea,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Sentence is to be judged by all the Churches (till the matter is examined, and cleared to the contrary) to be a right Sentence of Excommunication, and that his Sin is bound in Heaven: For they are rather to Judge that the Church hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded rightly, than to Judge on the Appellants side, until the matter is cleared: And so still it goes up as a Sentence binding in Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whether the Sentence be just or unjust, the matter is capable of no more than declaring and adjudging it such accordingly; and therefore it is capable of no such Act as may be called Rescinding. For if it be Just, no Sentence on Earth can Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scind God's Act upon that first Sentence, for it is bound in Heaven, and Man cannot alter God's Act; and if it be unjust, then there needs no power to Rescind it, but only to declare it to be unjust and void; and so to hold the Man, as if he had never been Excommunicated. And if Synods have but such a Declarative power, then let no more be affirmed, and we will not contend about it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If they have power of Rescinding the Sentence, then the Act done by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Courts, is made void by their sole Sentence, without any Act of Reversing, by the consent of those Congregations or Churches, that have pronounced it. For no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Court hath that power to Rescind the Sentence of another; but hath it so, as by their Act the Sentence is made void, without any Act of Revocation by the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Court. Thus the Honourable House of Parliament, if it Rescinds an Act of an Inferior Court, sends not down to that Inferior Court to Reverse it; but doth it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them. And if that be the intent of this Rescinding, let it be so decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>The other Prerogative of Power challenged by Synods, to Excommunicate other Churches, considered and invalidated.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Second Prerogative of Power challenged by Synods, which we contend against, and deny to them, is such a coercive power to be in them, as given them by Christ to Excommunicate other Churches, and so by that Rod, to enforce them to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:154381:105"/> Revoke their Sentence of Male-Administration, and receive a Person wrongfully Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by them. </p>
                  <p>That such a power is not in Synods to Excommunicate a Church or Churches, or so Rescind a Sentence past in a particular Church, is evinced by these following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For such a pretended power, there is neither Precept nor Example.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Apostles never did exercise such a power, who yet had power in all Churches, and over Persons among them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. None of the Reformed Churches ever practised it. Mr. <hi>Paget,</hi> a Learned Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterial Writer, acknowledgeth that none of the Reformed Churches ever practised it. Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> speaking of this power, did in his Days, put an, <hi>If it may be</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p>If it be said their Government is so good, as it hath had no occasion to put such a power into Act: I answer.</p>
                  <p>Let the Arminian Congregation, that were in the Low Countries, be remembred. Though a National Synod was called; yet none of them were Excommunicated, and yet we believe they judged their Errors worthy of their censure. So the Churches of <hi>Anabaptists</hi> among them, who not only hold the not Baptizing of Children, but run into many other gross Errors, were never yet Excommunicated.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that they forbear to do it, because of great Inconveniences that would follow, by provoking of Multitudes; and that it tends more (in such cases) unto Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to forbear it, than to execute it: It is Replyed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God hath Suited his Ordinances to the ordinary way of his Providence; and therefore would not have given an ordinary standing power for Government, which could not ordinarily be executed, without Tumult and Disturbance; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no such power given.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If a Church or Churches did deserve it, it cannot be for Edification to forbear it; for not to Excommunicate them, is to edifie them in Sin. Churches that deserve Excommunication, can be edified in nothing by being connived at in their Sin, that will Damn them. And Excommunication is the means appointed by God, for the destroying the Flesh, and saving the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither can a Multitude be an excuse for the neglect. For however these Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods (if they have such a power) are to Discharge their Duty, and the Soul or Souls of Sinners, must thus be punisht.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let it be observed, that such a power is contended for by the Presbyterial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which was never practised, which themselves think and judge inconvenient to practice; and yet without this power granted to them, they say there is no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And herein lies the main of this great controversy, whether they should have such a power or no, which they never have exercised; and themselves think it to be ordinarily inconvenient to exercise it, reserving it as a Rod, in the House which they never will use, as if they kept it to scare Children with. But the Efficacy of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lies not in the Speculation and Doctrine, but in what is practicable. Shall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms be Disturbed about the Dispute of that which in the practice is a <hi>Chimera,</hi> and when they have it, shall be exercised Arbitrarily, and at Discretion? Yea, may not a Tryal be made, whether that the other way (which they call no Government) may not be sufficient?</p>
                  <p>We further conclude this first Head of Argument with this, that as such a Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal power hath no President or Example in the Primitive Practices, nor in the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches, so it hath this character upon it, that none but the Pope and Bishops, and Synods of Bishops ever practised it: And they have practised it by interdicting Kingdoms, not simply as civil States, but as Churches in Kingdoms, commanding the Ministers to forbear to administer the Holy Things unto any that did cleave to their Prince, or for any the like causes. And certainly by the principles of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, a general Council of all the Reformed Churches, may in like manner Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate any Nation or Kingdom, whom they judge Heretical, or to make a Schism from them; for whilst the Foundation of the power of Synods is pleaded to lie in Christ's Institution, as it hath ordinarily been urged in the Assembly, in answer unto our Reasons, that the Church-Catholick is one politick Body, and so the Elders of all Churches have power over any Churches, that are parts of that great Body, be they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:154381:106"/> in Nations or in Provinces, which Subjects all States as truly to the Thunderbolt of Excommunication from Foreign Churches, as it did once to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What though it be said that such Counsels are not likely to be practised, or if so, it must be with the States own consent: Yet still the Mystery is, that such a power is contended for as a Rod over them, as well as over lesser Churches; for though they have not Excommunicated <hi>de facto,</hi> any particular Churches; yet they have claimed that power, as a Rod to keep them in awe with.</p>
                  <p>If it be said, the Pope challenged to do this, as an Head of the Church Universal, and as Infallible: We Reply, that there is indeed this difference, that he, as but one, usurps it, and as the External Head of the Church; but yet these challenge the same power, as being themselves the Catholick Church it self Representatively. For if to tell the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. be in its ascent to tell General Councels as the Church; then they must be interpreted to be the Catholick Church, and infallibly may in the issue (through Mens pride) become the claim also, by how much many consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are more likely to have the Holy Ghost to assist them, than that, and so have more reason for their claim, then one set up to challenge it. And at first, that one was set up only to receive Appeals, and to Rescind Sentences, and to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate Churches, and from granting to them that power at the first, did that other of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility spring.</p>
                  <p>A Second Head of Arguments, is drawn from the Nature of Excommunication; because that it contains more in that, than that which we call Non-communion, Namely this, that Persons are not only cast from communion with all these Churches (which we acknowledge) but further, are delivered to Satan, for the internal part thereof. And for the external part, it is strange that this Law of Synods, should oblige their conscience, that they should not meet among themselves, when as yet they are already a Church, and were a Church without any power derived from their associating with others. All then that they can fall from by vertue of the Sentence of the Synod, is but what they have from them, and among them by their association, and not what they have among themselves. Yea, the very words whereby Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is exprest, is but this, <hi>Sit tibi Ethnicus, Let him be to thee an Heathen,</hi> and <hi>take that Wicked one from among you:</hi> And therefore when Neighbour-Churches, deal so with a Church; they can but eject and keep them and their Members out from amongst them. But this power contended for, goes further; for the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod assumes to throw a Church out of it self, and to make them to be Heathens and Publicans, <hi>inter se, among themselves,</hi> who yet have all this while been a Church to Christ.</p>
                  <p>And that which further strengthens all this, is, that very Principle which the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly doth go upon to Establish this power in Synods and Presbyteries (given up in their answer to our Reasons against Presbyteries;) That as Families are bound to joyn into some Congregational Church, so those Churches into Association together: And as these joyned in a New Congregation, gives them power over each other; so this association of Churches, gives the whole a power over each of these Churches. Tho' we wholly assent not to this latter, yet supposing it (and it is one of the best and fairest grounds for the Presbyterial way) the Law of this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (if the Parallel be rightly made up) will not extend to a power of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating any of these Churches so associated. For, 1. If you take that External part of Excommunication, it is a cutting Men off from all Ordinances, wherein Church-Communion lies (as some hold) but more especially from the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper (which latter is acknowledged by all) for since Suspension cuts off from the Lord's Supper, therefore Excommunication must do it much more: Now the Parallel Law between these two kinds of associations, must run thus; That as a Congregation casts out of the communion of all those Ordinances, which a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation is the proper Seat of; so this greater association can by vertue of its associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, only cast out of those Ordinances that belong unto them, as such an associated Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in common, and from among themselves in particular; and then that Sentence can arise to no more than what we contend to be the only power that Churches have one with another; and that is Non-communion. The Reason is clear, because they can but cast that Church out of their association, and from having any interest in their counsel and advice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For associated Presbyteries, have not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the Solemn constant Ordinances of Worship; and therefore they can but by vertue of this association, deny them communion with themselves; and this we grant to Neighbour-Churches, that they may and ought to deal thus with an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:154381:106"/> Church, by vertue of that Apostolick Rule, <hi>from such turn away.</hi> But this power of Excommunicating a Church contended for, is a further thing, it is a laying a Law upon a Church, to Dissolve their being any longer a Church, until they do Repent of that Sin they charge them with; it is to call in their Charter, that they can meet no more, <hi>Inter se,</hi> among themselves to enjoy the Sacrament, or any other Ordinance whatsoever. This is beyond the extent of the power of an association; yea, this is more than they are able to execute, and doth Christ give power to do that which they cannot execute? Now they may keep them from communion with <hi>them,</hi> either by not letting them into the Assembly (and therefore they had <hi>Ostiarii</hi> Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers in the primitive times) or they may do it by thrusting them out; as the Priests of <hi>Israel</hi> did the King, when he came to offer Sacrifice, or rather by a Moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against them, or forbearing to Excommunicate, when they are present: But they cannot keep them from meeting, <hi>inter se, among themselves.</hi> In the Primitive Times indeed they had Recourse to the power of Magistrates for it; but we seek for a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Ecclesiastical Remedy.</p>
                  <p>To this if it be Retorted, that such will the case be too, when in a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, a company of Persons deserving Excommunication, are ejected (as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor and others with him) yet they will meet still, and no Law can oblige them to the contrary: We Reply, by giving this Difference of the case.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That when a Congregation doth cast out the very Members, the Act it self whereby they cast them out from among them, leaves them barely a company of Out-laws, without Church State or Relation among themselves; for they had it but as Members of that Church, they are now cast out of; and they can Retain no other Relation left them, that gives them actual Right to Ordinances; for this is their Original first Relation. And therefore if they meet, yea, with a Mutual consent to be a New Church, they meet as Men, and Outlawed from a Church Relation, which they had put their Souls upon the Laws of; or at least by a Judicial Act past on them, they have now forfeited. They fall as the Angels, from that Original State, and if they will set up a New Kingdom, they do it but as the Devils do. But although Neighbour-Churches did cast them out from among them, that Act in the Nature and Extent of it, Reacheth not to cast them out of that Relation of a Church, that they had originally among themselves; Neither do they fall by vertue of that Act (which is all that is in the Synods power) from that Church Relation they had among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; which they had before their associating with <hi>them,</hi> and was the Foundation of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By that Act of being cast out of this Congregational Relation, they are cast out of the formerly enjoyed communion of the Lord's Supper, in a constancy in that Church; which they never enjoyed at all in that other Classical Church, for it is not the Seat of it: And so this Act of Excommunication, as in a Congregational Church performed, casts them out of all Ordinances, and out of all that is proper to such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Fellowship; but it is not so in the other case. And hence it comes to pass that Excommunication from all Ordinances, can only be in a Church where all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are; and therefore not in or by a classical Church, where the main Ordinances Men are shut out from, are not Administred:</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Act of a Synod's Excommunicating a Church, is yet further for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal part of it, not simply an Obligation, not to meet for Ordinances, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of each other as Heathens; but further yet, the Sentence Terminates it self upon their Church-fellowship and Communion, Dissolves that, cuts them off from being an External Body, or Spouse to Christ, gives them such a Bill of Divorce, as removes the Candlestick, takes that in pieces, yea, delivers them as such to Satan, and makes them as Heathens and Publicans each to other. For otherwise if the Act be only the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod's putting away this Church from among themselves, or the communion of other Churches; that we readily grant may be done, and surely it is Remedy sufficient through Christ's Blessing (although this is reckoned no Government.) But to do the other Act mentioned to Church or Churches, Christ hath not given power to Synods.</p>
                  <p>If it be answered, as it is by some, that the Object of this Excommunication of a Church, is only the Persons therein materially considered, but not their Church-State, otherwise than by consequence: We Reply, that formally the Object of this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, is a Church as such, which is evident from this; that the great Argument
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:154381:107"/> alledged by the Presbyterial Divines is, that else there is no Remedy for an erring Church, as well as for Heretical Persons: And also that the Sins, which are the grounds of such Excommunications, be still Church Acts, Publick, not Personal, as grosly evil Administrations, or permissions of Notorious Sins, or Heresies Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Upheld, Defended, Adhered to by all in their Assemblies. And how else should Excommunication of a Church differ from the Suspension of a Church? This puts them into <hi>that State,</hi> as during the time of their Excommunication, they are to be reckoned as no Church, untill they Repent; for if they are as Heathens and Publicans, then they are no Church, unless we will make Heathen Churches, which is a contradiction. And if that whole Church should die Impenitent, they are to be reckoned to die, as out of Church-State among themselves, as well as in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to other Churches.</p>
                  <p>Now to prove that it is not in the power of Synods, thus to do to Churches, let the following Reasons be considered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is a <hi>Maxim</hi> of the Reformed Churches, that <hi>Ecclesiae sunt pares,</hi> Churches are equal, and <hi>Par in parem non habet potestatem,</hi> one equal, <hi>hath not power over another.</hi> Admonish they may, withdraw communion they may; for as one Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may do so from another, so these Churches may from an erring Church; yea, and a Synod being an Ordinance to them to heal them, and consisting of more Elders than are in that Church, they may declare Christ's command and will to them; but yet they have that power to deliver to Satan, to unchurch them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We find not that a Synod or company of Elders are called a Church, and if they should be so Named, yet still they have not more of Church in them, than other Churches have; nay, they have less, for they want a Body of the Faithful, and their interest joyned with these Elders, who are more usually called the Church: They are not the Seat of the main Ordinances, for which Churches were constituted: They have not the Sacraments administred: They are not Bodies erected primarily for Worship; but only so far, as may occasionally accompany and subserve their Discussions, and Determinations. It would therefore be strange, that these should have so much more of Church in them, as to have power to unchurch other Churches and Bodies to Christ, when themselves are but Representative, at most of the Body of Christ (for Christ hath no Representative Body to him) but every Church consisting of Elders and People, are the Body of Christ, and so called, when the other never hath that Name.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Dissolve a Church's external Estate as to all Ordinances, is a matter so far above Excommunicating single Persons, though never so many, that it is Christ's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative alone to do it. This is confirmed,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By like instances in civil States, wherein to Dissolve an Incorporate Town, and to call in, and take away their Charter and Priviledge, belongs to the Supream Power; and though Judges and others may deal with Persons in Corporations, yet the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations themselves depend on the Crown.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is confirmed by Scripture, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 5. Christ from Heaven makes it his Prerogative, to remove the <hi>Ephesian</hi> Candlestick, <hi>Repent, or I will come quickly and remove thy Candlestick.</hi> The Candlestick was their Church-State, Revel. 1. 23. <hi>The seven Candlesticks, are the seven Churches;</hi> and therefore he speaks not of their Mystical State, as they were Members of the Mystical Body, but of them, as they were a Candlestick Artificially formed up into that Holy Fellowship amongst them. So also it was Gods Prerogative alone, to give a Bill of Divorce to <hi>Israel,</hi> as she was a Church, and so it is expressed. And if it be said, it was done Ministerially by the Prophets declaring it, and so may this also be done to a Church by its Ministers: We Reply, that it was done by them Prophetically, as foretelling it; but there is no such Spirit of Prophecy in Synods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is Christ's Prerogative alone, to build and erect a Church, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of Ministerial Ecclesiastical power, to derive power to them; therefore also to Dissolve that Fellowship, and the use thereof, belongs only to him: Churches to be Erected, may and ought to have the direction and consent of Neighbour-Churches, because a New Sister is to be added to, and associated with them; but they receive no power from them, to become a Church. It was not the Intervention of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles power, that constituted Churches, further than as they converted Materials for Churches to be made out of, and as they Directed and Taught them to become
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:154381:107"/> Bodies unto Christ, teaching them to do whatsoever Christ hath commanded them; but we never read, that making them Churches, was a Ministerial Act in them; we read they Ordained Elders, but not that they Ordained Churches. <hi>Paul</hi> says, he planted indeed, and he was a Wise Master-builder; but he speaks the one of converting Persons, the other of Doctrines, because he speaks of building Hay and Stubble afterwards.</p>
                  <p>It is the great Error of some of this Age, that having lost all Church-state and Ministry; therefore (say they) there must come Apostles to make Churches again, whereas if all Ordinances had been lost under Antichrist, yet if there be Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and they have the Apostles Writings, those Writings do Authorize them as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to become a Church, and choose Ministers, and then to Ordain them, as if the Apostles were alive. <hi>Moses</hi> was not the Builder of the National Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but Christ immediately did it, and not merely gave Directions, Heb. 3. 3. <hi>This Man Christ, hath more Honour than</hi> Moses, <hi>in as much as he that Builded the House, hath more Honour than the House,</hi> whereof <hi>Moses</hi> was but a part himself.</p>
                  <p>If it be answered to all this, that by Excommunication, their Fundamental Church-State is not Dissolved, as the character of a Brother, or of a Minister, is not so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced when Excommunicated; but that if he Repent again, he remains a Minister without a New Ordination: We Reply, besides the Reasons forementioned, that so likewise if Christ should remove the Candlestick, and unchurch any, if they Repent, their Church-State would be Restored; and 2. If they be thrown out of their own Church by Excommunication, this Church-State must remain as it were in the Air, as an accident without a Subject. And 3. If they be cast out of the visible Church (which is the greater) by Excommunication, then they are cast out of the less also.</p>
                  <p>It may, and hath been said, that in cases of Male-Administrations, wherein Churches have Miscarryed and Erred, though Synods have the power of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in such cases; yet it is not necessary for the Rectifying of that Evil, that they should proceed against the Church, so as the Church should be the object of their dealing with; but it may be enough for them to deal with Persons only that are Scandalous, whom the Church will not amend; and that then in case of the Churches neglect, they may Excommunicate those Persons.</p>
                  <p>Now unto this we Reply, that in these cases of evil Administrations, what power Synods are betrusted withal, is to be primarily, or at least as much exercised upon the Church that hath miscarryed and neglects its Duty, as upon the Persons: And therefore it will not Salve it, that they should let the Church alone, or deal more lightly with them; and so take upon them to Excommunicate the Persons, whom the Church neglects to Excommunicate. Which is made good by these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the priviledge and power of that Church, be it Classical or Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, that is the first Subject of Excommunication; they have the power first from Christ to do it, and a command so to do, and the Duty lies on them. And therefore Synods are to call upon them, and to provoke them to do it, who have that power committed to them, and not take it out of their Hands; for Synods are not to assume more power than the Apostles did. When the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to Excommunicate the incestuous <hi>Corinthian, Paul</hi> did not take it upon him, and Excommunicate him himself; but in this case he deals with the Church, for not doing their Duty, because the power of Judging was committed to them; <hi>Do not ye Judge them that are without?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. He blames them, lays it upon them as a Sin, and if they had still continued in that neglect, their Sin had been as great as that of the Man himself, and greater. And therefore Christ also in his Epistle from Heaven, to the Church of <hi>Thyatira, Revel.</hi> 2. 20. blames that Church and the Angel thereof, for suffering <hi>Jezabel</hi> to Teach, and lays the Sin upon them in this case, as well as upon <hi>Jezabel</hi> her self: And therefore if Synods are to Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate at all, and have power to Excommunicate the Persons, they must proceed against the Church also.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If it be said, that the Church must be supposed not to see that Reason (for want of light) to Excommunicate a Member or Members, that the Synod doth, and so they may not have that cause to deal with the Churches, that they have with the Person or Member: We Reply, that if the Sin be not evidently notorious
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:154381:108"/> in all Mens Eyes, deserving Excommunication; but such, as it may be well suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the Inferior Church might not see ground for Excommunication, why should the Synod meddle with cases of that nature, why should they not rather rest in the Sentence of those Inferior Courts? And if it be such a Sin as is Notorious, and the Scandal answerably, then surely this Church that Person belongs unto, is as much, yea more in fault for their neglect or partiality. And surely Synods (if they had any such Authority) being such Great and Superior Bodies, should not intermeddle but in cases suitable to themselves, in cases of Moment, great and manifest to all Men's Consciences.</p>
                  <p>And 2. The constitution of Synods, and the Relation they bear to Churches ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues it. They are not as <hi>Totum integrale,</hi> but <hi>Collectivum; not an integral whole,</hi> they are not <hi>Ecclesia integralis,</hi> but <hi>Collectiva,</hi> not an integral Church, but Collective, that is, they are in our Brethren's intent, a Church of Churches (if a Church at all) and not in an immediate way a Church of the Members of those Churches singly, and apart considered. Their First and Primary Relation is therefore to the Churches, as a part of that whole, and but Secondarily unto the Members; and they are therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to deal in all such cases of omission with the Churches. Their Work is to have the care and care of Churches, and their Miscarriages; and therefore to deal with Members only, and let the Churches alone, is to neglect that which is their proper charge.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. So it was in the Government of <hi>Judah,</hi> the <hi>Synhedrim</hi> did not themselves med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Person to be Judged, and pronounce the Sentence in stead of the Judges of a particular City, but left it to them still to Judge according to their proper Priviledge; but dealt with the Judges, in case they pronounced not the Sentence; and so here it should be, if we will suppose any such power at all to be in Synods.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may and hath been said, that Presbyterial Government supposeth the fault of this Excommunication, to lie in the Elders that Excommunicated the Man, and so need not to deal with the Churches by way of coertion to them; but only with those Elders that had the Hand in it, who may be Deposed, and others placed in their room.</p>
                  <p>To which we Reply, 1. That the People are supposed also at least to give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Excommunication of a Person in a Church (by their own acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and according to the practice of the Reformed Churches) yea, and are to Judge as the Jury doth, by finding a Man Guilty; and the Officers are as the Judges (so in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. 5th</hi> and <hi>6th chap.)</hi> And if so, then they are to be Judged in fault, as well as the Officers.</p>
                  <p>But 2. If the People are not to be Censured and Judged, yet suppose they cleave to their Officers in this Act, as thinking that they ought, and as being convinced with them, that this Man is to remain Excommunicated; and therefore dare not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with him, as it is their Duty in such a case: Then the People are to be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, as well as their Officers, and both of them for this same thing, as being a Church Act, according to their interests, common to both.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Officers only should be Excommunicated in this case, and others put in their rooms: Then 1. If the People do cleave to their former Officers, these Officers will want a Church to officiate unto; and why should they Desert their Elders, when they in their consciences Judge their Act to be Just? It becomes them to say, let us all dye with them in such a case. And if the Synod will Excommunicate a Pastor, and the Elders of a Congregation (supposing the People cleave to them) where is it that you will Excommunicate him? In their own Church, or in your Churches? In his own Church, the People are against it. And if in your Churches, where is the Peoples concurring consent to this Man's Excommunication? And if it be done in your Churches, you only throw him out of your own. Or 2. If they do not cleave to their Officers, yet they conscientiously Judging that they ought not to receive the Man into communion with themselves, here is still no sufficient remedy for the Man by this.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let it be further considered, that if these Elders only should be Deposed; yet they are perhaps the whole, the greater part at least of a Classis (for by the greater part, every thing is carried) and so of the Elders of many Congregations. Yea, if the Provincial hath seconded the Sentence; then the greater part of the Elders of a Province, are to be Excommunicated also: And if the People cleave to them (as of old they did use to do to their Bishops) then the People of all those Churches
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:154381:108"/> also, must be Excommunicated, and what a havock of the Churches will this make?</p>
                  <p>If it be said, that in this case as in a Rebellion, some few are singled out for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the rest: It is answered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not in this, as in civil Government; for there capital punishments are chiefly for example, to prevent and deter others; but here this of Excommunication, is for the personal good of those that have Sinned, to destroy the Flesh, that they may be saved; and therefore the Souls that deserve it, ought and must be Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Neither is there any Warrant to think, that when the Merit and Obstinacy of the Sin, calls for that Ordinance appointed, the only means to cure it (which cure is only to bring Sinners to Godly Repentance) that that Sin will be healed, by any low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er means of making others an Example: The Excommunication of some few, may be a means to prevent those that are not fallen; but not those that are fallen into obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy. 2. In such civil Mulcts, Princes and States have power to Pardon the Rebels, or to pass the Crime by; because the Injury (so far as 'tis civil, is to themselves) but no Ecclesiastical Court hath power to forgive, but where Christ forgives, and he forgives only the Penitent; nor yet ought they to forbear, if they have the power of inflicting this Spiritual Punishment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let the Inconvenience be considered, if Synods should Excommunicate Persons (when the Inferior Churches did acquit them) without Excommunicating the Churches themselves, what Confusion and Disturbance it is like to bring. The Persons Excommunicated will say, where I am known, and am a Member, there I am acquitted, and not medled with; but by Strangers, and the Elders of a Nation (having taken the cause out of their Hands) I am condemned. This will bolster up Persons, and make them obstinate, and they will oppose Sentence against Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Arguments against Subordination of Synods, to rxercise Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction or Government. The first Argument, that there is no Warrant or Design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of such a Subordination in all the Scriptures.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THough we judge Synods to be of great use for the finding out, and declaring of Truth in Difficult cases, and encouragement to walk in the Truth, for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offences; and to give Advice unto the Magistrate, in matters of Religion: And though we give great Honour, and conscientious Respect unto their Determinations: Yet since not only an occasional, but a standing use of them be asserted and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that in Subordination of one unto another, as Juridical, Ecclesiastical Courts; and this in all cases: We Humbly present these Reasons against it:</p>
                  <p>All Subordinations of these Spiritual Courts, having greater and lesser Degrees of power, to which in their order causes are to be brought, must have the greatest and most express Warrant and Designment in the word for them. Whence it is argued thus.</p>
                  <p>Argu. 1. <hi>Those Courts that must have the most Express Warrant and Designment for them in the Word; and yet have not the least, their power is to be Suspected; and not Erected in the Church of God; But these have not the least: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>There ought to be the greatest and most express Warrant, and that for two things belonging to them. 1. For their Subordination and Number. 2. For their Bounds and Limits of Power. And because this principle is made use of both in the point in hand, and other of like nature; Namely, to argue <hi>à pari ratione,</hi> from like and Parallel Reason, the Argument to Establish this Proposition, shall proceed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, from the strength of like Reason, in other cases and instances, that there ought to be, that there ought to be a Warrant and Designment in the Word for them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the like Reason, in the case of Subordination of Officers in the Church, one over another, there was a special Institution, and it is required; or we own them
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:154381:109"/> not; and that for intensive power, and extensive power; and therefore for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of such Courts also. The Rule of proportion holds; for a Government of, and by special Subordinations, whether of one Church-Officer or Person over an, other, and of him over others; or of a many in the like Degree of Subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are but several Forms of Government, of which there is the like reason in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. As of Subordinations in a Monarchical way, wherein but some one Person is Superior to another downwards, or in an Aristocratical way throughout, in this they come all to one; that if there be to be an Institution or Warrant for the one, there is to be for the other, whether God or Men be to be the Institutors of them. Now in the Government of the Church, for the Subordination of Officers, there was an express Institution, or Men ought not to have assumed it, 1 Cor. 12. 18. <hi>God hath set in his Church; First Apostles, Secondarily Prophets and Evangelists</hi> (who were of a Parallel Order) <hi>Thirdly Teachers;</hi> and the difference of power in Apostles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelist's, is by Subordination; but Christ hath not set the like Subordination of Courts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is proved from what the Presbyterial Principles themselves Reject: An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution is required by them in the case of Subordination of Bishops, Archbishops, Popes in their arguing against them and their power: Yea, and by the Episcopal Writers themselves, who when it is objected, that if there may be a Bishop, and an Archbishop over him, why not a Patriarch over Archbishops, and a Pope over all? They deny this, and Reject a Patriarch or Pope (although these Popes should Renounce Infallibility) as not warranted by the Word. They say, an higher and more Universal Subordination, alters the case. And the usual exception against this Subordination of such Church-Governours, is that in Scripture, we read neither of the Name of an Archbishop, nor of the thing, and therefore not of a Subordination. The like may be said of those; where read we of Councils Provincial, National, Names or Things? Yea, and in this way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in this Respect) the Disadvantage is on this side rather; for we are sure that once there was in the Church, such a Subordination in Church-Officers, Evangelists over Pastors, Apostles over Evangelists (only they were extraordinary, and so no Patterns.) But of such Subordinations of Councils in an Aristocratical way, there is nothing to be found.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is argued from like and just reason, in other Societies and Bodies politick. In all Kingdoms and Commonwealths, well ordered and constituted, there is, and ought to be a set and express Order by the Laws, both of the number and bounds of Courts of Judicatory, from whom, and to whom Appeals are made, and in what cases, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if this Subordination should be set forth, and fixed by the Law, is as necessary as the Laws and Rules by which Men in a Kingdom are to be Governed. The Wisdom of the Law doth Judge it not enough to appoint several kind of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as to say, <hi>Councellors, Serjeants, Judges;</hi> but designeth also, and appoints se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Courts, with their power and bounds, the Designment of which (especially standing Courts being made up of these) is a matter of much more Moment, than the other. Yea, and still the greater and higher such Courts and Assemblies are having amplitude of power over others, the more express Evidence and Warrant for their power, there is and ought to be; as for Parliamentary power, and the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereof. And this is evident, as from the Example of all Kingdoms, so from what the Scripture speaks of the constitution of them. Each part of the Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such power in all Government, both was and is called a Creation of Men in things Humane, whether it be in a Monarchical or Aristocratical way, 1 Pet. 2. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your selves to every Humane Creation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he speaks there evidently of (and therefore thus stileth) the Subordination of powers in a Common-wealth, whether Officers or Courts, for it follows, whether unto the King as Supream, or unto Governours, as those that are sent by him, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> and so have Subordinations of power under him, now Parallel, Spiritual and Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Government with this. As in the rearing of an Humane fabrick and contig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of power, there must be an Ordinance or Creation from Man, when God hath left the framing of it (as in this case he hath) so this Subordination being in Divine power, there must be a Divine Institution of it, besides that of the Distinction of the Officers themselves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is argued from like Reason with Christ's Institution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. If in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church, Christ hath prescribed the several Subordinations of proceedings, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:154381:109"/> set forth the Degrees, Bounds, and Order of them; then much more it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in these, by how much a larger extent of power is committed to them. The First Rule in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. for proceeding, is, <hi>If thy Brother offend thee, tell him thy self:</hi> Then 2. Take two or three, and if he hear not them, then 3. <hi>Tell the Church.</hi> If there were a Thousand Brethren in a Congregation, a Man were not bound, nor were it orderly in an ordinary and set way, to take, as the Church shall please, first two or three, and then ten, and then twenty, and still the like proportion of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and greater number, ere he comes to the Church it self: But Christ hath set the Order, and his Wisdom saw it meet thus to design, and limit the proceedings in a particular Church: And it had been much more necessary, to have appointed the like about these more general and greater Assemblies; because every one of these Courts (intended) have the power of a Sentence and Judgment, whereas those two or three, proceed but in a way of Admonition, in order to a Superior Court. Shall he take care of Congregations (which are esteemed the meanest) and not for these, of which if he should not have set the bounds of power, and the Subordination thereof? None would know what belongs to them, who is in fault, if offences be not corrected; now would any know whom first to Appeal unto, I will appeal to the National Assembly first, says one, and am not bound to the Classical or Provincial: Another would say, I will appeal to a general Council, which can best judge, and will be sure to make an end of it. Why should any be hindred from going, <hi>per saltem,</hi> if Christ hath not set forth, and obliged us to these Subordinations in their Order?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the Churches of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the Subordinations that were, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>re set forth and Determined, by Institution or Example, how many Courts there should be, and where to rest. There were the Courts of the Cities and the Towns; and then their <hi>Synhedrim,</hi> to which the cause was to be carryed, if it were too hard for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Courts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. In the New Testament, we have for removing Scandals, a Congregational standing Court and Government (or be it a Classical standing Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, over many Congregations, as our Brethren say) and we have an example also, of going out from a particular standing Church, whether the one or the other electively to another Church or Churches, when Divisions are therein (which <hi>Acts</hi> 15. holds forth) but still for such standing Subordinations and Courts, as these out of this Church nothing at all. If there had been any National <hi>Synhedrim,</hi> a set and constant Judicatory; then Christ would have appointed it as he had done before, but he hath not, no example, no constitution holds it forth, which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. And</p>
                  <p>I come now to prove, that these Subordinations of Synods, have not the least Warrant and Designments of them in the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The New Testament is silent in it. And if it be said, that all Nations were not then converted, when the Apostles Wrote: It is answered, that God in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, took care aforehand to set the Order when they had no Cities, nor were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Land. And accordingly, if the Apostles had not lived to see that which might occasion such an Institution or Precept; yet they would some way have left order for time to come▪</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But, Secondly, Though the Apostles lived to see many Famous particular Churches Erected in a Province, as well as in Cities; in a Nation, as in <hi>Judea,</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> in <hi>Creete,</hi> there were many Cities and Churches in each: And although all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in those Countries, were not Christians nor Members of Churches; yet there was matter for the moulding and casting them into these Subordinations, as well as now in <hi>France,</hi> where not the third part are Protestants; or in the low Countries, where not the Tenth part of the Inhabitants are Members of their Churches. It had been as necessary to have appointed them. They set up, and appointed all needful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, for ordering the Churches after them, when they should be gone: And 'tis more strange, that in the case of the spreading of Errors, they should not Write to Churches as gathered into Synods, and as having the standing power to prevent and suppress them (if such Ordinary standing Assemblies Armed with coercive power, had been then in that existence as now.) That upon no occasion, this should be done, when yet they had occasions.</p>
                  <p>Take the Seven Churches in <hi>Asia, Ephesus, Thyatira, Smyrna,</hi> &amp;c. with the rest of the Churches therein, a Province, called therefore <hi>Proconsular Asiae,</hi> and though
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:154381:110"/> therein we find many great Disorders, and some in Doctrine (the more proper Work of these standing Synods) yet we see that Christ Writes only to each of these Churches apart; and Reproves each, for the Disorder in Each: Whereas had they been one Church, in such a standing Association for Government, and had had ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial and National Assemblies extant, as now, the Reproofs would have been especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally directed thereunto. As if Errors and Disorders were in the classical Churches (as those all are pretended to be) of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the chief Rebuke would now more justly fall upon the National and Provincial Assemblies as their constitution is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yea Thirdly, The Holy Ghost would have at least vouchsafed to these or some other Churches that were in like manner in a Nation or Province, as <hi>Galatia,</hi> &amp;c. in Respect of such a Combination, the Name of a Church, who must have had accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Principles of this Government, so much of the power of a Church. But no where are the Churches in a Province called a Church, but Churches in the plural: And if the lesser Churches, then these; yea, rather these, having most of the power, should therefore rather have had most of the name. Yea, and by how much the Church-power thereof, should have been most independent (as a Nation is) and so come most eminently within that Rule, <hi>Tell the Church</hi> (from which words, these pretend their power; and yet cannot shew so much Title there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as to have the Name Church given them) let a Rational account be given of this.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Second Argument against Subordination of Synods, that it would introduce a Foreign Ecclesiastical Power over every State and Kingdom. The Third Argument, that there is no constant standing Rule, by which such a Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be ordered and managed.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Arg. 2. <hi>IF there be such a Subordination of Synods in the Church of Christ, then there is no Independency, but in an Oecomenical Council: Which first would bring in a Foreign Ecclesiastical Power over each State and Kingdom. And Secondly, which therefore of all other, should have its Designation and Existence in the Word, and is more needful, than all the other two sorts of Synods mentioned; for if any should be Extant, then that which is</hi> Remedium efficacissimum. 'Tis said, there is wanting <hi>Remedium efficax,</hi> if these Subordinations be not; but according to these Principles, there is wanting that which is the most Efficacious Remedy, if a General Council be not extant. For if there be not a Resting in a classical Presbytery, but Provincial also must be, and appealed to; neither are they reckoned Efficacious enough, but there must be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional also, upon this Supposition, that the greater Assembly hath more of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and assistance of Christ, than the lesser; then of all other, a General Council must be supposed in a Transcendent manner above all the rest, to have the promise of Assistance made to it, and so to be the most eminently Efficacious (if not the only) Remedy on Earth; yea, and only to be Rested in, being that which only is the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. Some of the Papist's, they gave this to such a General Council, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err; but according to these Principles of Presbyterial Divines, though it might err, yet it is supposeable to be Transcendently more irrefragable, than all the other under it; and God more with it, than with all the rest: And therefore God in his Word, would have given especial Order for this, above all other; and the same God that suits his Providences to his Institutions, would not have fail'd in what is the most Soveraign Remedy of all other, that it might have been existant in all Ages; as we see his promise was to the <hi>Jews,</hi> to keep their Land, when the Males thrice a year went up to the <hi>General Assembly</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> But for 300 years, the Churches wanted them, and could not enjoy them, and they are adjudged, therefore not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Government of the Church, which yet according to these Principles, must have been the most necessary of all the rest. Yea, and further else, Thirdly, there must be an Injurious Independency set up in a National Synod; For when a Man hath Appealed from one Court to another, and comes to this National, that is,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:154381:110"/> the ultimate existant, and upon the Sentence thereof, comes next to be Banisht out of a Nation, to have his Estate forfeited, to the Ruine of himself and Posterity; then it is he most of all needs the Relief of an higher Remedy, more Efficacious, than all those he hath gone through (if such an one may be) yet then he is left Remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and (according to those Principles) left more unsatisfied than ever; because, thinks he, there is by God's Appointment, a Court that hath more of God, and of Christ in it, than all these to Judge of the Truth and Right; and Lo it is not, nor can ever be expected.</p>
                  <p>Let it be withal considered, that when God appointed a Subordination of standing Courts, he withal designed out which should be the Supream, and made it the Ultimate: And the Supremacy and Independency of it, in a Set and Standing way, was his Institution, as much as the appointment of the Court it self: So that he was to be put to Death, that obeyed not the Sentence of it, and all Appeals were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by cut off. Therefore if a National Church, doth take upon it to be an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Church, upon the Sentence thereof, to have the extreamest punishment execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (but that of Death) that in a Nation Men are capable of it, had need, for the quieting of all Men's Spirits, that must submit to it, not only shew a Warrant from God, to be an Ecclesiastical Judicatory; but also to be the Supream Court, as the <hi>Synhedrim</hi> was, that Appeals should be made unto.</p>
                  <p>Arg. 3. <hi>To that end Thirdly, Let it be examined, what Set Rules there is, or may be supposed to be of these Subordinations, and their Bounds, and the Ʋltimate Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in a National Church; which should be fetcht from some standing considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the word Warrants: God never having constituted a Church, but he gave the bounds thereof.</hi> All variation of Church-power, is from God. The alteration of the Government of his People the <hi>Jews</hi> from a Family Government (which had been under the Law of Nature) to National in <hi>Moses</hi> his time, was by express ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: And as himself made and constituted it a National Church, so there was an Ecclesiastical Government framed by himself, suited thereunto. And in the New Testament, there is a Reed to measure the Temple, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1. a Rule to set out the limits of Church-power, as well as under the old. And therefore the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is framed thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Church-power which cannot shew a set and constant Divine Rule for its Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and Subordination, and Ʋltimate Independency, is not of God, and so</hi> May not be. <hi>But this Variation of Church-power into these Subordinations, cannot shew any such steady constant Rule for these things. Therefore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is evident from what hath been said. The <hi>Minor</hi> is made good by a removal of all particulars, that may be supposed to be the Square of framing these Subordinations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not that Rule, that the greater number or company of Churches, should Rule and Govern the less; and that the whole should Rule the part, is a sufficient square, by which to Frame these Subordinations.</p>
                  <p>For then, 1. There would be as many several Subordinations, as there can be supposed Variations of greater Numbers; and that will arise to more than these three only. Every New greater company, would constitute a New Synod. 2. Where is the promise of God, that he will be more with the greatest part of them that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Christianity, rather than with a few, so far as to constitute a New Power and Government? Yea, 3. The greater number of Churches professing Religion, are more corrupted; the pure Churches are fewer. It had been ill for <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and the Angel, and Elders thereof, if those seven Churches in <hi>Asia,</hi> had been cast into such a Subordinate Association for Government, to be exercised by the Angels and Elders of all the other six Churches, with the rest in <hi>Asia.</hi> And the like may be said of the purer Reformed Churches in <hi>Germany;</hi> if the greater number of those that yet were True Churches, should have Ruled the lesser; then <hi>(Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> being bound to this Government) the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (being also True Churches, and yet the more in number) would by vertue of this Law, have soon corrupted the purer. And what reason can be pretended (according to this Rule and the Principles of this Government) to leave any True Churches out of an Associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? 4. Suppose there should be as many Elders and Churches, more purely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in one Province or Shire, as in the rest of a whole Nation besides (as instance
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:154381:111"/> might be given in some of the Reformed Churches that there are) why should not God be thought to be as much with them, as with the National Assembly? And if all are to give themselves up to this Law, how will the greater, which is the wose, either corrupt the purer, or express them? 5. If <hi>Qua</hi> greater, then the Decrees of greater; <hi>(viz.</hi> General Councils) in former Ages should bind us more than Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or Provincial now; for they should have had more of Church in them (by this Rule) and so more of Christ; and then take all General Councils, that set up Popes and Bishops, and all other Superstitions. If it be said, we chose them not; yet still that is not the ground makes their Decrees less Divine, or obliging to us; but it lies in the Authority of God's Ordinance, that they were the greater and more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils. And however, still if this be the Rule, that the greater number of Churches, Rule the less; then take the measure of this greatness and number of Churches from Time, stretching the Line over all Ages past, as well as from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number of Churches in such or such a place, or Nation in the present times; and so look what General Councils, for most Ages of the World did Establish, should (by vertue of this Law) oblige the present times, and have more force upon us, than the Universal Church in this present Age; much more than of any National Assembly, if either be simply considered, under a meer Ecclesiastical obligation; that is, <hi>Qua</hi> greater, and more of Church: Time varies not the case so, but that all their Acts, having been Acts of the Church-Universal in all Ages, should comparatively stand more in force; but however, the Acts of any of the last General Councils will stand in force, until a Ceneral Council of like extent, Repeal those Acts, as the Statutes of Parliament of our Ancestors do, if not Repealed by like and equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not the notion, or the consideration of their being Churches in such or such a Nation or Province, that can be the Rule of making this Obligation, or setting of these Bounds. It must be considered, that the question is of a meer Ecclesiastick obligation, by vertue of Church Principles, such as should have been a just Rule and Measure to the Primitive Churches, e're Princes turned Christian, to have rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the like Subordinations. Now then the Limits from hence, must either rise from being first one Church in a Kingdom, under the same civil Government. Or Secondly, One Church in a Nation; that is, either from a <hi>National</hi> respect, or <hi>Political.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. First in general from neither; for that instance in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. of the Council there, its Rise, or the bounds of its Authority, was founded upon either: For if either <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> or <hi>Political</hi> Respects, should have obliged them, they should have sent to <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> or <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and not <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> who were both under a differing Government ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and of another Nation. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, More particularly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not <hi>Qua</hi> Church in one Kingdom; for that is <hi>per accidens</hi> to a Church, that it grows up to a Kingdom, or that the whole Nation is converted to Christianity; and therefore a Set Rule for all Times cannot be fetcht from thence. This could not be the certain measure of the Independency of Church-power, in the Apostles times.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This makes the bounds of Ecclesiastical Independency and Jurisdiction, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, varying, as the bounds of Kingdoms do vary. When the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> had all Kingdoms under it, all the Churches must then have been obliged, to have had then General standing Councils, suited to the extent of the Empire, to have been the next unto the Provincial, for their Supream Judicatory, such as the National are now to the Provincial, or else before the Empire turned Christian, there was this Rule, even as many Independencies as Churches: And then again, when this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was broken into ten Kingdoms, yea, and many more, there arose instead of the former, many new Independent Boundaries of Church-power (of which only the question is, and not of that power which a Church doth come to have, and simply and alone holds of the Magistrate, which will be meerly civil) and then, as Kingdoms vary by Conquest; the like alteration the bounds of Church-power must receive. Among the <hi>Jews</hi> it did not, which when the Church was broken into two Kingdoms, by Gods appointment, yet the Church-State by God's Institution, varied not; but was still one Church. Lastly, If this Independency ariseth from the Magistrate, then there is no need of such Subordinations, which is proved by experience in Reformed Churches abroad, who are well enough governed, without
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:154381:111"/> these Subordinations. <hi>Geneva</hi> hath no Appeals, but is governed by one classical Church; and why may not all other Churches, as well without them; if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate oversees them, and keep each to their Duties? The Churches in the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, want National Synods, and yet are peaceably governed; yea, some for a long time have been without Provincial, and say, if they can, they will never have more; and yet are peaceably and quietly Governed. It is as the civil Magistrate will Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the Independency, and himself overlook it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, If these bounds be fetcht from National Respects, then in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> the <hi>Calvinist's</hi> must be subject to the greater number of <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and in this Kingdom, all Ministers must make up this Association, and the greater number will be the worse, and oppose the good. If because the <hi>Calvinists</hi> that profess a further Reformation, are Disobliged from Associating with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> then those in any Nation, that profess a further Reformation than others, are free by the same Law. Surely uniformity of Principles, is a more intimate bond of such Associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, than any such outward extrinsecal respects. 2. If <hi>Qua</hi> Nation, then <hi>Wales</hi> must be Independent. 3. If <hi>Qua</hi> Nation, then 1. If Nation be taken for a People of the same Tongue and Kindred, all the Christian <hi>Jews</hi> in the Primitive Times, when scattered into any Nation, were bound to have made one Church Distinct, from all the Churches they cohabited with. 2. If for a People dwelling in the same National bounds; then the same <hi>Jews</hi> being dispersed into several Countries and Nations, must have made one Church, with the several Nations where they lived; whereas <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epistle, and <hi>James</hi> in his, and <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> wrote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Jews</hi> apart, as Churches in all Nations.</p>

                     <p>The Fourth Argument against Subordination of Synods, that it requireth Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Spiritual Power, arising from other Representations.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>Arg. 4. <hi>THAT Government which necessarily requireth and produceth Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, arising out of other Representations of Spiritual Power, having a Derived power therefrom, there is no Warrant for. But these Subordinations of Synods, Provincial, National, Oecumenical, for the Government of the Church do so,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> shall be spoken to, after the <hi>Minor</hi> Proposition is both cleared and proved, which is done by putting two things together. 1. That if there be an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Subordination of all Churches in the Provinces, to a National Assembly, and so of many Nations to an Oecumenical, binding unto Subjection; that then all in the Provinces, must be interested in that National, and all in the Nation, in that Oecumenical; so as it may be said, that they are all involved and included, and so obliged, as it is in Parliamentary power, wherein the Shires are involved. 2. That this interest in this Subordination, cannot arise but either by immediate choice of those Elders who shall Represent them, by each Church and Congregation immediately (which is the case of our Parliament Men chosen immediately by those they Represent) or else, that the Provincial Elders sent by the Congregations, shall choose out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, some few that shall Represent the Provinces; and so likewise the National Assemblies, shall choose out some few, that shall Represent the whole Nation in a General Council. Now the first of these is not, nor can be: The Congregations meet not for any such immediate choice; but the Elders of them, all choose out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. So as the Obligation of all the Churches, to Subject to a National Assembly (arising out of those other Subordinations) is not because they are a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Elders or Divines; for in a Provincial Synod, there may be Assembled as many, as in the National; but it ariseth from hence, that some out of all, do Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the rest; and otherwise, when a National Assembly sits in a Great City, all other Neighbour-Ministers must come, and Vote with them, and Outvote them who are the Representers of the whole.</p>
                  <p>Now such a Representation, having a derived Spiritual power from other Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, is not in matters Spiritual Warrantable. Besides all Arguments against de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:154381:112"/> power in matters Spiritual, all Ministers being immediately <hi>Christi vicarii,</hi> and that all such Representations grow weaker, as Reflections use to do, Elders Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Churches in Classical and Provincial Assemblies, as being immediately chosen by them; but the Elders in National Assemblies, are the Representations of Elders in Provinces, and so are a shadow of that first shadow, whereas yet they have the most of power, even all that can be supposed to belong to the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Besides such considerations, it is argued thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If that these few out of Nations, should bind all those Nations in matters Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and a few out of Provinces, the Nation, they must be supposed to have the the promise, and an Assistance answerable. But where is either the promise, or can Gifts in a few, be supposed to produce such an Obligation? 'Tis true, <hi>where two or three are gathered together,</hi> his promise is to be in the midst of them, and so suppose with more, when more are met; but that his promise should be to be with a few out of a Nation, as with the whole Nation; and those not chosen immediately by the Nation, but the Representers of them, cannot be expected. 'Tis granted, that each so met, hath the Gifts and Assistance of an Elder; and so the whole, as of so many Elders met (as we in this Assembly are to be lookt upon, and the Judgment thereof accordingly Reverenced.) But that as they are Elders Representative of Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of other Elders, who themselves are Representers of Churches, that any such Addition should arise to them, by vertue of this Duplicated Representation, over and above what is in their single Gifts and Offices, let either a Warrant be produced, or a promise. Two things are allowed them; but a third denied them. 1. It is granted, they may have Assistance to Judge as Elders, which is their Office. 2. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance to Judge according to their Personal Abilities, being thus called to give their Advice. But 3. Such a Superadded Assistance, as holds proportion to that Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Bulk and Body, which they Represent (for suppose that always it falls out, that the best and choicest of a Nation, are chosen; yet still not to hold proportion to a whole Nation) there must be a more than ordinary promise for it, and therefore had need be express and evident. That it is otherwise in Common-wealths, is because the Representations, and also the power conveyed, being Humane Creations, the Persons Represented, can set up a power which shall Represent them: But this power we speak of, is Supernatural, and must be from God, and his Institution. The <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> had a special Assistance above all Courts else; and therefore God appointed causes to be brought to it, which special Assistance is intimated twice in the Institution of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. by this, that they <hi>should go up to the place which God should choose,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>and do according to the Sentence which they of that place (which the Lord shall choose) shall shew thee.</hi> An Emphasis is put upon the Blessing, which by God's Choice and Election, did accompany that place which God had chosen, to put his Name, and promised to be in an eminent manner, present in, and to accept their Sacrifices there offered (which was a Representative Worship of that Nation) and not elsewhere. Now as that was the Representative Worship of the Nation, so these Governours were the Representative Governours of the Nation; and both Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in that place, as the Gift was by the Altar, as that which God had chosen. If the like Institution were found, with the intimation of such a Blessing from a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar choice of God's, of National Assemblies, all ought to subject to them in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Spiritual.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there be such Representations as these, in one or few Persons of many Churches; they have each for that time, whilst in such an Assembly, Archiepiscopal and Episcopal power, and their case is Parallel (Parallel then for that time and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and as met in a Synod) with that of so many Bishops, when met in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, whose Episcopal power, as then and therein met, lies in this, that they are so many Churches Representative, especially this would fall out, if these Synods should still consist of the same Men, or if some few should be always chosen to them. And why may there not be standing Persons, that are more Skillful in such Affairs, through exercise usually chosen, as well as standing Assemblies themselves? And then as touching matters of Jurisdiction in such an Assembly, they are for the present, the same with so many Bishops met in a Convocation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If these Representations, having the power of all the Churches in the Nation, were Warrantable, they must be a Church. Besides, that they are no where so called (we leave the Usurpation of that Name, to the Popish Clergy) and if so, then a Body
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:154381:112"/> to Christ; for so every Church is, and where is Christ said to have a Representative Body, of his Body? They are a Church, that is, a company of Elders personally ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, but a Representative Church they are not, cannot be; and yet must be, or they have not the power of all the Churches in a Nation in them, nor otherwise do their Acts oblige them to Subjection.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reasons against the Allegation brought, of</hi> Acts 15. <hi>for the Subordination of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, Provincial, National, Oecumenical. And Reasons against the Argument drawn from the Analogy of</hi> Matth. 18.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BEsides what hath been said against this Example, alledged to prove Presbyterial Acts of Government, by the Elders of the Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> in the Reasons formerly present, proving, 1. That that one Example, cannot serve to prove both the Presbyterial Government and Synodical; but that if the Assembly will lean to the one, the other must be quitted. 2. That the Assembly was not a formal Synod, but only a Reference by the particular Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> of their differences among themselves, unto this particular Church of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and no other. It is moreover added, that the Example of it is here further extended, to prove all sorts of Synods and Subordinations thereof, both Provincial, National, and Oecumenical, and so it must suit all these so great varieties, when it was not made fit for any one of them.</p>
                  <p>But if it had been a Synod; yet 1. Neither Provincial, nor National, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for <hi>Antioch</hi> consults not with the Churches of her own Nation, but seeks to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> a Church of <hi>Judea,</hi> of another Nation, and another Province. 2. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it the instance of a standing Synod (which the word Subordination doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily infer them to be standing Courts, or else the Links of those chains, will not hang together) but Elective; for they sent, out of Election and choice to them, but about this one question at this time, without any obligation to refer all other matters to them in an ordinary way. 3. Nor is it the Multiplication of Synods, but only of one, in whose Judgment those of <hi>Antioch</hi> rested. 4. Much less is it the instance of rearing up of a Subordination, and Contignation of Synods, Superiour and Inferiour, which is a further thing. For though when offences are not healed, and one Reference to other Churches is not sufficient to cure them, there should be a seeking to others; yet the example obligeth the Churches that are in difference, not to take and choose the Churches of that Province, either as of that Province, or as the greater number to whom both those among whom the controversie is, and those to whom it was afore referred, must be Subordinarily Subject. Much less doth it hold forth, that the Churches of that Province, may judicially challenge a Right of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to decide it, and oblige them <hi>sub paena,</hi> to their Determination; and then the Churches of that whole Nation, challenge the like over all. But still it runs in this way only, that those who shall be Judged meetest and ablest, and Faithfullest to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and compose it, by those who are to refer it.</p>
                  <p>The Argument is usually drawn from like Reason, and let there be found like Reason, and it is granted; and though it self is not the pattern of a Formal Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, yet it holds forth this Rule of Equity, that when offences arise among Churches, References ought to be made from out of themselves, to Churches abroad to heal them. But the question is, to what Churches these References are to be made, and how? And let the like Reason held forth in the Example, be kept unto, and decide it. Say we still to those Churches, the Churches offended or divided, shall choose as fittest and ablest to determine it. This is clear in the Example; <hi>Antioch</hi> was not bound to refer it to the Church of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as greater, or as a next Neighbour, or of the same Province; but as best able to Judge of the Differences. And this way agrees with the Law of Nature, and of Arbitration, so usual amongst Men, which God hath there set up, as an Ordinance and Pattern of proceeding in such cases. But this Subordination of Synods intended, holds so differing a course from this, as 1. In stead of Elective Synods and Occasional, it sets up Standing, and so set to be the Judge
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:154381:113"/> of the Churches under them for ever. 2. Not in one case (as <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem)</hi> but in all cases what ever shall fall out. 3. Not in a way of Multiplication or Diversification, as need shall be, but of Subordination and setled Superiority; and the grounds of this to be, because the greatest must Rule the less, and that they are Neighbour-Churches, in the same Province or Nation. And this the like Reason, in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. is so far from countenancing, that in all things it is unlike, and so there is a differing constitution, and Rise of those Synods thus Subordinate, and what the Reason drawn from <hi>Acts</hi> 15. will warrant; and therefore doth make a differing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Reason in the Government; and Humane Prudence added, will not Rectifie it, when the Reason of the Institution is so much varied from. For instance, if the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Law for Remedy of Wrongs, and deciding controversies in any Kingdom, were by Arbitration Elective to take them their Judges, whom the parties in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence judge aptest every way for the present controversie, and that the Presidents and Ruled cases hold forth no more; and if that the Government of another Kingdom were, that the greater should Rule and Determine the causes of the less, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion thereof, to have Subordinate standing Courts erected, to which (by Appeal from the one to the other) all causes should be brought: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were not these two such differing Frames of Government, so as that he that would mould the first to the second, might not be challenged to set up a new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, differing from the Fundamental Law of that Kingdom? And whether the one is not at liberty to withstand the Second, if it were vouchsafed to any Kingdom (and that is the case here) is humbly Submitted? And the bounds of such Assemblies Elective, needed no set or standing Rule; because they rise from occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Electiveness, in case of controversie and offence, and the extent thereof: And so the condition and nature of the things themselves, do prescribe their own Limits, and hold forth their own rise; like as the bounds of particular Congregations, to be of such as live so, as conveniently to meet in one place, ariseth from the Nature of the thing it self, and the necessary requisites thereunto.</p>
                  <p>I shall now consider the Argument drawn from the Analogy of <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The strength of the Argument runs, that because there should be this Remedy, that therefore there is such a Remedy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis granted there is a Remedy, which is a going forth to other Churches, which <hi>Acts</hi> 15. holds forth; but that Excommunication (which is the Remedy held forth in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.) of the offending Church or Churches, should be the Remedy, is not there held forth, as hath been shewn. There is a Remedy of Co-ordination, such as between two Nations, and as between <hi>Pares</hi> (as Churches are) proceeding in a way suitable to their condition, but not this of Subordination, that the greater number of Churches should become standing Courts, and have power to Excommunicate the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser; but that all Churches have a power to <hi>Declare</hi> the offence, and withdraw commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from those Churches. And in Reason, how is it possible for a National Church, to Excommunicate all the Churches of a Province? And how ineffectual would that be? Or for a General Council to Excommunicate a Nation? And if they cannot use this Remedy, to what end is this Subordination of Synods, having this Authority pleaded for?</p>
                  <p>And whereas 'tis said, that there must be the same Remedy, that is is in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation for an offending Brother, or else where the Disease is strongest, the Remedy is weakest: It is answered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That where the Disease is strongest, there this, which is called the strongest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, cannot be applyed, or with an apparent inefficaciousness; for when the Churches in a Province err, or a National, here the Disease is strongest, and yet it would be in vain to interdict them communion among themselves, or deliver them unto Satan. Yea, when it comes to the highest, and where the Disease is greatest and strongest, there is not only no Remedy, but the highest and greatest power to do hurt upon all under them; as when the generality of the Clergy were <hi>Arrians:</hi> And if they err, the error is worse than of a Pope's erring, or of a Bishop's, he is but one, and may be Deposed; and in the greater Bodies of the Clergy, the greater part are, and have been still the worser, and more corrupt, as is apparent in this Kingdom at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, in which (by vertue of the Presbyterial Principles) all Ministers must be taken in; and if you will put them out, where will others be had in their room? Convert
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:154381:113"/> Men we cannot, and if not converted, Ministers of all others, are the worst and greatest opposites to Religion: And if a National Assembly be chosen by these, the greater number are like to be of the worst, and such as may alter all that you now have done. And if it be said, that this would hold against great politick Bodies as well, who may undoe the Common-wealth: The Answer is, that the common and equal interest of all, and the common Principles of preserving the Rights and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a State, and seeking the common good, is natural to the generality of Men; but the Truth of the Gospel and Purity of Religion, and the power thereof, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the principles of all Natural Men; and in all Ages the most of the Clergy have been aptest to corrupt the one, and oppose the other. And in those Ages, when such Councils began to be standing, and in most credit, after the first 300 years, then was it that the Mystery of Popery did work most powerfully, and those Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious and corrupt Opinions grew up, which made way for <hi>the Man of Sin,</hi> and that Body of Popish Doctrine, that hath overspread the World. And if there should be no danger of corrupting the Truth; yet the Churches (though Reformed) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all out of Popery, and not being fully enlightned in all things, and the first No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing further in matters of Theology, usually falling into the Hearts and Spirits but of a few, we shall have no further Truth taught, but Suppressed, till a whole Nation is inlightened in it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Efficacy of all Remedies, doth depend first upon Christ's Blessing on them, which depends upon his Institution of them; and <hi>Par Ratio,</hi> or like Reason will never set up an Ordinance, unless Christ hath himself appointed it: And in the example <hi>Acts</hi> 15. there is not this way of Proceeding held forth. Secondly, it lies insuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the condition of those that are to be dealt with: Now when many Churches deal with an erring Church, the Churches in a Province, with many erring Churches, or of a Nation with a Province, they must be in Reason dealt with, suitably to the condition of Churches, and of a Multitude; and surely a Brotherly way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and withdrawing Communion, is more suitable unto such: As in the civil Government, if a Province Rebelleth, or a great Multitude of Subjects, should the State presently hang up all in that Province, although unto particular Persons Rebelling, this is Efficacious to suppress Rebellion. Thirdly, Christ hath suited his Remedies unto all times. and unto all conditions; and how National and Provincial Assemblies could be during the first 300 years, when yet the Churches were all Governed, is submitted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And Lastly, if the Analogy of this <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Matth.</hi> be argued; then first let the Analogy be kept, and then when a Church hath offended other Churches, they are not to bring them to a Set Court of Judicatory at first; for Christ's Rule is otherwise, in dealing with an offending Brother, electively to take two or three Churches, and Admonish them, which is suited to that way forementioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. But as for the proceedings against a Brother in a Congregation, there is not a Set appointed number, of two or three standing Persons, to be the Admonishers of all, e're it comes to the Church, nor have they power to Excommunicate: And thus by this proportion, in stead of these Set and Standing Provincial Assemblies, to whom causes are next brought, and these Armed with power of Excommunication, there should only be two or three or more Neighbour-Churches, to Admonish the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church; and not a Stated Court to bring it unto. Secondly, Let it be shewn, where a standing Synod of Elders is called <hi>the Church;</hi> and how then can the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy hold, when it holds not in this, the main, <hi>Tell the Church?</hi> Lastly, the like reason holds not, unless these particular Congregations have the power of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; for otherwise if these greater Assemblie's power be argued from the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of the lesser, and the same Remedy, Excommunication, and the particular Congregations have not that allowed them; then by the principles of this Analogy, it is no where to be found, but as the Congregational Churches have a power only to Admonish, and to Suspend to Sacraments, that so the greater Assemblies should <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Assembly of Divines at</hi> West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mister.</note> have no more also. And though the Church Universal, is called a Church, and one Body to Christ; yet as materially considered, and not as a politick Body, in respect to Government; which was never yet asserted by this Assembly.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Intercourse or Communion, which particular Churches are to hold one with another. That there is a Twofold Communion of Saints, the one arising from the Relation which they all bear to one another, as Members of Christ's Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body; the other which proceeds from their being formed into particular Churches by Christ's Institution. That the Duties of Catholick Communion, which one Believer ows to another, by vertue of their all being Members of the same Mystical Body of Christ, those Duties, one, or many Churches, may and ought to perform to another Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving proved that neither the Church Universal, nor a Church as National, or in a Kingdom, nor a Church classical of many Congregations associated, are the Subjects and Seats of political power for Juridical censures, as Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a Congregational Church only: There yet remaineth to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what Intercourse, Communion, and Correspondency we assert, to be between each Church and their Elders, by vertue of any, or all those considerations and respects. We acknowledge, that by vertue of the consideration of the Church Universal, whereof each Congregation is a part; and by vertue of Churches being in a Nation of the same Language, under the same civil Government, or living in the same Neighbourhood, and being of the same Judgment; there is to be a great and near communion to be entertained between all such Churches, and according to such respects. This communion is to be observed, with some more nearly and strictly, and such is the Nature of this communion, as it will oblige all Churches one to another, in a multitude of mutual Duties; which if observed, may help to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Churches from running into confusion, may rectifie miscarriages, preserve them from errors, and may Salve all those inconveniences, which use to be objected against this Assertion, of placing only political power in Congregational Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>We lay this for a General Rule; that there is a Twofold Church, and Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which the New Testament holds forth; and answerably, a Twofold way of communion. There is first, a Church-Mystical; and secondly, there is a Church Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical, or a politick Body, which is the Seat of Government by Institution. We said at first, that communion of Saints and Churches, do both run along together, in a parallel proportioned communion of Saints, being the Foundation of uniting all into that Body of the Church, and as we said, there is a Twofold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, one fixed for communion in publick Ordinances, the other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional, so there is a double constitution of Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is first a Church Mystical, and a communion answerable, whether we take it for the invisible company of the Elect, or for the visible company of the professors of Christianity, that do walk as Saints throughout the World. The invisible Church, is acknowledged by all sorts, to be a Mystical Body; but it is not only called a Mystical Body, as it is opposed to the Church visible, but as it is opposed to a Church by Institution, that is, a politick Body. The visible Catholick Church, is not a Body by Institution, as in Heaven it shall not be. We acknowledge, that the visible Saints in a Kingdom, or in a City, may be called the Church, as bearing the respect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, or notion of the Mystical Universal Church (as every part of water bears the Name of the whole) so as it is not only the Church Universal, that hath the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a Mystical Body put upon it; but the same consideration may be put upon any company of Saints, whether smaller or greater, in a Kingdom, or in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or in a Province. And so we believe, that oftentimes when in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Saints in such a place are spoken of, and called the Church; they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so. <hi>Sub consideratione Mystica, under that Mystical consideration,</hi> and not as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a politick Body; as when it is said, that <hi>Saul persecuted the Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9. it was not the Church Universal that he persecuted, it was not a Church under a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical consideration; but it was the Saints in every place, where he came: So when it
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:154381:114"/> is said, that Prayers were made <hi>by the Church for</hi> Peter, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 5. it is not spoken of them, as a Church congregated for Worship, or a Church political; but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the Saints generally in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and about in <hi>Judea,</hi> prayed for him, the Saints being there called a Church under that Mystical consideration, that the Church Universal is called.</p>
                  <p>Now answerably unto these two several considerations and notions of Church, whether applyed to the Church Universal, or to any parcel of Saints; there is a Twofold Communion, and the Duties are Twofold, which the Saints owe one to another. The one in respect of general and Mystical Relation, as occasionally they meet, or are cast together; and the other is as they are formed up into several Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by Christ's Institution. This may be exemplified by the like, among Mankind. Take all Mankind, as they are made of one Blood, under the general notion and consideration of being Men, by vertue hereof, there is a communion that one Man may have with another, and there are Duties that thence do arise, and as it is the Law of Nature, singly and apart considered, which obligeth them, as they are Men; so answerably there is a communion, and there is a Duty, which every Man oweth to every Man, as a Man, and a Duty which one Man oweth to many Men, considered as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or to a greater number of Mankind; and therefore we say, there is the Law of Nature, which holds all the World over, and Laws of Nature, that are Fundamental to Men, as Men: And if you cast Men into several Nations, there is the Law of Nations, common to all Nations, as they are Nations, which binds them to Duties, one toward another. But there is another communion that Mankind hath, as they are formed up, and when they are formed up into several commonwealth, which tho' it be a mutual communion of those commonwealths, one with another; yet it ariseth not to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Authority over one another, but is but suitable and answerable to that communion, which Men have one with another as Men. Thus in the matter of communion of Saints as Saints, there is a communion which is carryed through all Saints, as it were by the Law of Nature, and that is carryed between these Saints, as formed up into several Bodies or Churches. The same kind of communion, holdeth between Church and Church, Elders and Elders, that would hold between Mankind, as formed into several Common-wealths; and there are Duties which they are obliged unto mutually, for mutual Help, for mutual Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are Associations, and Leagues made to several purposes; and there are Defiances, and Renunciations, when the Laws of Nations, and Nature common to Kingdoms, are broken. Amongst the Saints, there is a communion betwixt the Saints cast into the same Family, and there are Duties answerable and suitable; and then there is a communion which the Saints have, consisting of many Families united into one Church, and there are Duties agreeable: And there is a communion, and Duties which are to pass between these Saints, as they are Members of a Nation, and as they are Churches in the same Nation, and upon many such Respects; yea, and also as they are parts of the Church Universal. Only in this, here lies the difference between us and our Brethren, that they would make the communion which is between all the Saints, and all the Churches in the World, to be as truly political, the lesser being subject to the greater, in the Church Universal, or in a Nation, as it is in a particular Congregation, as we would; or as it is in a Church classical (according to their Opinion) or as it is in a particular Congregation, as we assert it.</p>
                  <p>Now that there is such a differing kind of communion, the one by way of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Jurisdiction; and the other according to the common Law of Nature as we may so express it) is evident by the Principles of either side. For the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Divines, who hold National Churches, in a political consideration (when Churches come up to that number, as to make a Nation, and so several Nations, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See the</hi> Scotch <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for Ʋniformity.</hi>
                     </note> National Churches) yet hold, that there is a communion to be held between these, and an obligation to a multitude of Duties; yea, and an uniformity that is to be between these, when yet they will not say, that the one hath Authority, or power of Jurisdiction over the other. As for instance, if you take the National Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the National Church of <hi>England,</hi> or if you suppose that there were but two Churches in the World, there would be a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion held between the one and the other, and ought to be, when yet the one could not assume a power over the other; but each retains a power of Jurisdiction intire within themselves. This different kind of communion, appears likewise by
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:154381:115"/> this, that there are Duties which one Saint oweth to another, upon meer Moral grounds, as that a Man should pray with, and pray for a Saint, and build him up in his Holy Faith, and Admonish him; and not let Sin lie upon him, or withdraw from him, if he do not Repent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that if there were but two Saints in the World, which could not make a politick Church, they would owe all these Duties one to another; but not upon a ground of Institution, as a Duty of the Second Commandment, but as of a Duty the Second Table, which bindeth us to love our Neighbour as our selves. And so if there were no Congregations or Churches in the World, the Saints would upon such a consideration, owe to one another abundance of Duties. Yea, indeed there is almost no Duty that is practised in a Congregation, by way of Institution; but a Duty of a like kind upon another ground, is required occasionally of Saints one to another. Men that have Preaching Gifts, might exercise them occasionally, to the edification of others in a Natural way, where there was not a Church, nor Officers of a Church; and yet God hath took up Preaching into an Office, made a calling on purpose for it, by way of Institution. So, to avoid any Man that walketh inordinately, to instruct him, to reprove him, are Duties which one Saint oweth to another, and one Saint to many Saints, and many Saints, to any Saint; which kind of Discipline, the Saints did practice one toward another, in the Bishop's times, and had a Warrant so to do, in the Word of God; but all this did run, as it were by the Law of Nature, in a Moral way, by vertue of the Second Table, and the Duties of it. But as Jesus Christ hath by Institution, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his Saints into several Churches (so that such Bodies are by Institution) He hath stamped all such Duties, as are amongst Christians by this general Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with an Institution over and above that former meer Natural or Moral conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He hath here appointed one Brother to Admonish another, in order to bring him up to that Church he belongs unto, to a censure; and he hath Ordained pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Persons, that should be by way of Office Admonishers in publick; and that should Admonish with Authority, and with such an Authority put upon that Admonition, as thus performed, as is not to be found in all the Saints in the World, if they should Admonish a Man. There is not only a withdrawing (which one Saint may do from another, though there was no way of Church-Fellowship) but there is Superadded, an Institution of casting out; and not only so, but a delivering unto Satan, which all these Saints in the World cannot do; for what power had they, unless it be from a promise annexed to an Institution, to deliver a Man to the Devil, for him seize upon a Man's conscience, when he is thrown out.</p>
                  <p>Hence therefore the Saints formed up into Congregations, with their Elders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, the only Ecclesiastical Body by Institution; an instituted Authority and Power of Jurisdiction, is found only answerably in them; and all other Relations of Saints and Churches one to another, fall only under a Mystical consideration, and therefore their Communion and their Power, is answerable. The one runneth <hi>in a way of special Institution;</hi> the other, <hi>Modo Mystico, in a way of Mystical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:</hi> To the one, the Ordinance of Excommunication, is therefore only proper and peculiar, to the other a withdrawing, or a Non-communion appertains.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence therefore in the first place, we do grant and acknowledge, that many of the same Duties and Actions, which performed in a particular Church, do rise up to Jurisdiction, are and may be performed by a greater number of Churches to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church; but only <hi>Modo Mystico, in a way of Mystical Communion,</hi> because the Relation is such; and yet the Duties may be the same, and the Actions the same. A greater number of Churches, may Admonish another Church, they may cast out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church from their Communion and Association; but all this will not arise to a Juridical power of Excommunication. They may declare Men to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of the Faith, to be Hereticks, so as to fulfil the Apostles Rule, not to eat with them, or bid them God speed, <hi>John</hi> 2. 10, 11. and yet in all this, it doth not arise to assuming Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We acknowledge in the second place, that in such Actions of many Churches toward one Church, there is an Impress of Authority, taking it in a larger Sense, for that which hath a perswasiveness, and an inducement in it; but it will not arise to an Authority Juridical, such as Jesus Christ hath placed in them, as they are a political Body: But for that power which is placed by Christ, by vertue of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, there is a Superadded Authority of Jesus Christ, beyond the force of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:154381:115"/> or Rational Inducements; and the conscience is to be subject to the Power and Authority therein, as unto the power of Christ, for his Will and Institution sake. If we take the Elders of one Congregation, besides all the considerations that are common to them, with all other Elders and Sains in the World, there is an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity stamped by Christ upon them, by vertue of their Relation and Office, so as the Members of that Congregation, are to be subject to them, not only upon Moral grounds, but on account of that Authority with which Christ hath invested them: And in the Acts that they do (Admonitions, casting Men out, Excommunication and the like) there is an Efficacy to be expected, which is in no other order of Men in the World, if they would undertake the like. The Difference of these two powers may appear, by Abstracting all Rational or Moral Inducements. 1. This Authority of the Elders, is more than Authority by way of Reason, or by ones al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging an express Rule out of the Word, which a Man's conscience may apprehend by Faith, from the Mouth of him that doth direct him, or lay it before him. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Wife or Servant, may Subject her self to the guidance of a Reason, or of a Scripture, that is brought by another Man, who yet hath not Authority ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, such as her Husband hath, when he addeth a command thereunto besides. A Child is said to lead one New Converted, <hi>Esa.</hi> 11. 6. But in this case, it is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Authority of the Word or Reason alledged, that the conscience subjects it self to, without any further respect to any thing in the propounder. 2. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Jurisdiction, which is in a particular Church, is more than the Authority of Reverence or Respect, to the Grace or Judgment of another, founded upon whatever considerations, besides the Institutions of Christ. There are many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, that may breed Reverence to another, as their Grace and their Holiness, and the power of their Gifts, as <hi>Herod</hi> Reverenced <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and feared him, because he was an Holy Man. Thus a Man's Wife may be iuduced to obey the command of one that is a Minister, though not her Minister, she knowing him to be a Judicious Man, and a Man of much Holiness; but yet still, this doth not arise to a power given from Christ Juridically, by way of Institution, over and above such Respects. It is not such a power, as her own Minister hath over her, and for which, she is to respect and regard him; neither is it such, as her own Husband hath over her. The Judgment of many Ministers Assembled, hath an Authority of Reverence in it, because they are Wise; yea, and because they are the Ministers of Christ, by whose Judgments, Jesus Christ leadeth Men into Truth; and as they are Ministers of Christ, they have a special Blessing accompanying of them, and all such Respects the Consciences of Men are to take in to move them to yield to what they declare and determine: Yet, still this doth not arise to the consideration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridical Authority, which they have from Christ, over those whom they would guide, but such a Man's own Elders have. 3. There are many considerations, which may make a Man to Subject himself, to what another saith, which yet doth not rise to Juridical Authority. A Man in the cases of Scandal, and offending of a Church or a Brother, may forbear to do that which is in his liberty to do; but the Brother offended, hath not Authority Juridical over the other; for it is but an accidental consideration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the Third place, we acknowledge that by vertue of this Mystical communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Churches hold one with another, in their Mutual Transactions one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are to look on them as Churches, and on the Elders, as instituted by Christ, and not only as Holy; but yet still they are not to regard them, as having an Instituted Authority given them by Christ, over this or any other Churches. Thus when <hi>Paul</hi> would put a weight upon his commendation of <hi>Titus,</hi> he put it upon this; that he was one, whose praise was in all the Churches, and that he was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by the Churches, to carry the Alms. And therefore of old, in the Letters that were wrote from one Church to another, were Superscribed as from the Churches (as in <hi>Clement's Epistle,</hi> the Stile runs thus, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>to the Church of</hi> Corinth) and they do deal with them, as one Church of Christ dealeth with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and as having the Authority and Spirit of a Church with them, in their Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, in their Reproofs, in their Directions, or the like; but still it riseth not to Jurisdiction. As if one Kingdom or State, doth deal with another State, they look on it as such, and accordingly Respect it, and their Mediations or whatever other
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:154381:116"/> interpositions of theirs, are directed to them, not only as a company of Men, but as they are a State: And yet still it riseth not up to any Jurisdiction, that one State hath over another. And so also in the Transactions of Elders of other Churches, unto any Member of a Church, or to the Church it self, over which they are not Elders, they yet are to be looked upon as Elders, and accordingly respected in their Admonitions, and in their Judgments; but still it riseth not to Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If a Noble Man comes from one Kingdom to another, as the Nobles of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as Commissioners into <hi>England;</hi> they are to be Respected and Regarded as Nobles, according to their Place and Quality, by the Law of Nations, and the Law of Nature, and communion of one State with another; but still they are no way to be regarded, as having Jurisdiction, or exercising the Office of Nobles where they come, as the Nobles of <hi>England</hi> do.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the <hi>4th</hi> place, we do grant that other Churches may deal with any Church (as occasion is) as in the Name of Christ; and Admonish them, Reprove them, and the like: But they deal in Christ's Name, in this Sense, that they intreat them by vertue of that Name of Christ, which is called upon by them, and which in a common way, all do profess, and which would be thus and thus Dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But they deal not with them in the Name of Christ, in this sense, as if they had a Juridical power from Christ, to deliver them up to Satan, such as the Church at <hi>Corinth</hi> had, when met together, over the Incestuous Person, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the <hi>5th</hi> place, it may arise to an Authority of commanding, and that in the Name of Christ; and answerably it ariseth to be the Duty of that Church to be subject, and to obey them. In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 16. (says the Apostle) <hi>I beseech you, submit your selves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.</hi> He speaks of Ministers, those that Labour in the Gospel. It's the same word with that which is used of Subjection to a Mans own Elders, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And yet it is not <hi>Subjectio legalis, a Subjection by Law of Authority</hi> (as <hi>Estius</hi> Distinguisheth it) such as a Man hath to his own Bishop (saith he) but <hi>Moralis; Qualem reverentes praestamus virtute excellentibus.</hi> But a Moral Subjection, such as we yield in Reverence, to those who excel in vertue. So as all Elders are to have in all Churches, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of Elders; and yet but such as a Church, considered as such, hath, and is to have from all other Churches. It is Reverenced, as a Church indeed, and as a Sister Church, but not as having that Authority over another Church, which it hath over its own Members, and such an Authority all the Churches in the World have not over one Church; as all the Imperial Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> have it not over one City. So as the question is not, whether there be not an obligation ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the Admonitions and Judgments of many Churches, and the Elders of them, and also a Duty commanded from Christ; upon all such considerations as have been mentioned: Yet still so far, and no farther, than such grounds will carry it, is this Duty to be laid upon a Church, and a Subjection called for, as Jesus Christ himself lays it upon them. They are to be Subject, not only because these Churches do present to them, in the Name of Christ, what is their Sin, or what is their Duty; but further, they are to take into their consideration, their being Churches, and Churches Instituted by Christ, with whom the Blessing of Christ is to lead them into Truth, and to regard the Elders of Churches, as Persons with whom he is in a more peculiar manner present. But yet still they are not bound in such a Subjection to them, as to their own Elders, who are by Institution, set over them, and to whom they have a Special Relation, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. If a Pastor of another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation should come, and is admitted to Preach for his Brother Elder in any Congregation; they are to hear him as an Elder, but yet not to hear him with that special peculiar Subjection, which by vertue of Christ's Institution, a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ows to their own Pastor.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The several Duties of Communion, which one Church ows to another, Enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. That this Communion doth not include in it, that one Church may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise any Act of Jurisdiction over another.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HEnce then all sort of Duties, that the Law of Love and Brotherly Union can any way exact or extend to, and that are founded thereupon in the Word of God, of Saints to Saints, and Church to Church, we approve of, and Judge ought to be held by any Church, to all Churches in the World; which we take to be the true meaning of that Scripture, in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. that the whole Body of the Church being joyned together, every part is to edifie every part, and the whole, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occasions, and in all ways possible; but it is in ways of Brotherly Love, it is not with a Spiritual Rod, but of coercive censure and jurisdiction. The Bonds and Tyes of Law, are acknowledged, not Rods and Whips of coercive censure, and Jurisdiction <hi>Sub paena Traditionis Satanae, under the penalty of delivering to Satan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thus first, They are to afford part of their Spiritual good things, as occasion is, to all or any Church: So by vertue of that communion, the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> was bound to cause to be read, as much as in them lay, that Epistle which was Writ to them in the Church of <hi>Laodecea</hi> also, which was one of the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches; yet that their causing that Epistle to be received by the <hi>Laodeceans,</hi> was not by any Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, but by communion of good things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There may be communion in whatever is matter of meer privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in any Church; but not in Jurisdiction. Yea, there may be Associations, and Leagues of Friendship, as between two States, when yet not Subjection, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Kingdoms, a mutual intercourse of Trade. As he that was free of <hi>Rome,</hi> was free all the World over, and he might come and Trade in any other Kingdom; so any that are Members of such Churches as profess both, for receiving in of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and casting out of Members, to go according to the Rule of the Word, may occasionally receive the Sacrament in any Church truly constituted, and bring their Children to be Baptized, and may partake of all the Ordinances; for this is only to partake of the common priviledges, but they are not to exercise any act of power or punishment, when they come to those other Churches; as if a Minister were to be chosen, or a Member to be thrown out, or Suspended from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are not to take upon them, to have a voice in it. Between two Families, there may be communion of good things, without exercising of Acts of Power and Authority; when as one Family doth not take upon them, to exercise Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the other Family, as not to chastise the Children, to dispose of parties in Marriage; nor is there any communion in conjugal Acts. So in Common-wealths, there is a communion of things communicable, as to afford Men, Money, and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, to give Subsistence to any one that will live in a Stranger Kingdom: But they are not admitted to choice of Magistrates, to Judge of Causes, to be of a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in any Nation, but their own.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Also Thirdly, There is that Brotherly communion between Churches, that whom one Church denies communion with, having cast him out by a just censure, all the rest of the Churches do Reject him also; which was an usual practice in the primitive times, as often <hi>Cyprian</hi> Writes to other Churches, saying, <hi>Abstinuimus, we have abstained</hi> from such or such a Man, that they might have warning not to admit communion with him. And this seems to be one great end of Synods, as appears from the fifth Cannon in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council before cited. And the Reason is fetched from that principle, which both Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> and <hi>Didoclavius</hi> assert, that we have communion with the Universal Church, by means of being joyn'd to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>ch.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 148. <hi>Of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi>
                     </note> a particular Church; for communion with the Universal Church, we cannot have immediately, and yet by vertue of a particular Church, we enjoy the same kind of Ordinances, as if the whole Universal Church should meet together: Hence <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Altar. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascen. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>pa:</hi> 853.</note> therefore, as we have communion with the whole Universal Church, by having communion with a particular Church, so we are cast out of all Churches, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of being cast out of one; the trust being committed by Christ, to particular
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:154381:117"/> Churches: And the Law of Ecclesiastical Society, and Brotherly communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Churches, requires it; that if they be cast out by one, they are Rejected by all; for there is that Sympathy and Concordance between all the Members of this Body, as one Body, and so between particular Churches, as Members of this whole, that as when one Member suffers, all suffers; when one Member rejoyceth, all rejoyceth, so whom one Church casteth out, all Churches casteth out, and whom one receives, all receives by vertue of this communion. Or if, when it is bound by a particular Church, it is bound in Heaven, then all the Earth over too; all Churches being to Reverence the Act and Judgment of a particular Church, with whom Christ hath betrusted the Keys. So as all the Churches do not Reject such an one, by an Act of Jurisdiction, or of interest in the Jurisdiction, but by the Law of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and by the like Law, that there is among Kingdoms, where there is Leagues Offensive and Defensive, to be Enemies to those that are Enemies to any of them, and not to Harbour those whom they have thrown out, and to be Friends to those that they are Friends to, and that are their Allies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There may be a communication, by a sending out of Elders from Churches, to Churches that want; yet without Jurisdiction, or the choosing of Elders for them, or putting Elders upon them. So Anciently, the Bishops in Cities did Instruct and Educate young Men, to fit them for the Ministry, whom afterward they sent out to the Villages that wanted (as young Men in Colledges, now under a Master) but yet (as our Divines against Bishops have argued) that did not prove a Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in Colledges it doth not. So the Church in the <hi>Canticles, Cant.</hi> 8. 8, 9. speaking of a Sister Church she had, which wanted Breasts, by way of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of good things, she afforded help, but yet without Jurisdiction, for she was her Sister. For still those Elders which in that case they should send out and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and part withal from themselves, or any other Church, are to be received and chosen by that Church, as Elders to them; and no way by vertue of any Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the Church that lends them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. So also in matter of Advice, there is communion between the Churches. There <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Diocesan Trial, p.</hi> 72.</note> is a double Direction (as <hi>Baynes</hi> Distinguisheth) one <hi>Potestativa, Autoritativa,</hi> the other <hi>Sociacia,</hi> or <hi>Social,</hi> as one Servant that hath more experience than another, may give Advice to another upon occasion. An Advice we acknowledge in Churches, by vertue of this communion; but then let it be but Advice, and where there is need. And so now in difficult cases, we acknowledge they are bound to Advise with other Churches; and in case of Miscarriages, they are to be Advised, and Admonished by other Churches. But when they do Advise, that such a Man should be Excommunicated, for such an Act done, they do not add Authority to that Church: Jesus Christ hath furnished the Church with sufficient Authority in it self, only they add Counsel, and Direction, and Countenance: Moral strength or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance they add, but not political Power or Authority. There is as much power in the Church it self, to deal with its own Members alone of it self, as in all the Churches of the World, put together: But this Advise is given, but as Alms is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Neighbour-Church. And again, that Advice, as to the object of it, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly but only to give their Judgment of the Rule; it is not a joynt putting forth the Act of Administration of an Ordinance, in a way of Application of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to the Persons: Neither is a Congregation bound up by the Institution of Christ, to Advise so, as if they do not Advise with a Neighbour-Presbytery, the Act is Null, and made Void, which they do, as if by Christ's Institution it were so, that they ought to Advise, such their case would be. In <hi>Babylon,</hi> they had such Elders as came to enquire, but not to judge, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 1. &amp; 20. 1. But all this Obligation to Advise in such cases, and the help that the Churches do give, ariseth (as our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren themselves say, in their answers to our Reasons) <hi>Ex Charitate, ex debito mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuae societatis colendae, from Charity, and the Duty of maintaining Mutual Fellowship,</hi> as is between Friends and Equals; <hi>Non ex debito inferioris conditionis ad praestandum</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 49.</note>
                     <hi>obsequium, not from any Duty, obliging the Inferior to Obedience.</hi> And all that they there say afterward, <hi>pag.</hi> 50. unto <hi>line</hi> 16. we acknowledge. And since they say it is <hi>ex debito societatis colendae</hi> only, and <hi>ex charitate,</hi> or as others have expressed it, <hi>Jure fraternitatis, by the Right of Brotherhood;</hi> and that the communion between Churches, according to their own expressions, is founded but upon that ground, hence therefore it can never grow up to <hi>Jus Jurisdictionis, a Right of Jurisdiction;</hi> for if
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:154381:117"/> the communion of these Churches, be in a way of Fraternity, then the Acts it ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to, will be but Acts of communion in a Brotherly way, but for the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Friendship to arise to Acts of Jurisdiction, exceedeth the Sphere of it, as the Acts of Grace, exceed the Acts of Nature. And if it be said, that all Acts in a Church, are Acts of Brotherly communion; it is answered, they are Acts of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly communion, in distinction to Magisterial power, or such power, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster hath over his Servants. It is not Lordly Power; but the power of Spiritual Jurisdiction, is a middle thing, between that of meer Brotherhood, which is between Saint and Saint, or Church and Church, and that which is Lordly; for it is a power Ministerial, erected by Jesus Christ, and by Institution, having also a Spiritual pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment, put into their Hands, to execute it, with a promise to accompany it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. One Church is bound to communicate to another their Temporal things, to send Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and one Man may be chosen by several Churches, to carry in their several Alms, to several Churches, as (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 19.) it is said of <hi>Titus,</hi> that he was chosen of the Churches, for that Service, the contribution being to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed from many Churches. But it is not to be said, that all those Churches met, when he was chosen; but his Office, being the Office of an Evangelist, to Travel up and down from Church to Church, he was by a Tacite consent chosen, first by one, then of another, and so of a third; otherwise the Apostle would have said, he was chosen of the Church of such a Province, if all the Churches had been united into a Synod, when it was done; but in that he saith <hi>Churches,</hi> it implies, that they were a part, when he was chosen. But if it had been such a common meeting; yet it was not an Act of Jurisdiction, it was by a common consent, to carry Alms; and such Acts in Synods, we acknowledge.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. We acknowledge, that there are <hi>Res communes, things in common,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern many Churches alike, in a Brotherly way. There were between the Apostles themselves, some things that were <hi>Res communes,</hi> as that they should confer, to see how far they should agree in the same Doctrine; and how far God had Revealed the same things to them, as <hi>Paul</hi> went up to that end, to confer with the Apostles at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Gal.</hi> 2. And yet there was not an Authority, that the greater number of the Apostles had in matter of Doctrine over another Apostle. We acknowledge, that the setting up Ministers over particular Churches, is <hi>Res communis;</hi> because the Transactions of all Business's between Neighbour-Churches, is ordinarily done by the Elders thereof; and therefore the bringing in a new of Ministers to such Associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, should be with their Privicy and Knowledge. But that will not arise to this, that the Neighbour-Ministers have the power of Ordination, the power of Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or that they have a Negative Vote, by way of Jurisdiction, to which the Church must by vertue of an Institution submit: They may give the Right Hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and it may be a due, <hi>Ex debito fraternae charitatis, from the Duty of Brotherly Love,</hi> that a Church, when it chooseth its Elders, should ask the Right Hand of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship from other Churches; but it must be remembred, that it is but giving the Right Hand of Fellowship, it is not giving the Right Hand of Authority to choose them their Elders, or to lay Hands on them. Because that Marriages are of a publick concernment to a Commonwealth, and to Families in a Common-wealth; therefore States are to be acquainted with Marriages, but the Power and Authority to guide them whom they should Marry, lies in the Parents, and in the Persons that are to Marry; and they may Marry whom they will, only in the Lord. And such a Respect to other Churches, it is no more an Act of Subjection to them, as having Jurisdiction then according to our Brethren's Principles, it is a Subjection in the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not to Excommunicate, if the People (who they say have no interest of Authority, or of a Negative Voice at all) should be against the Excommunicating of a Person.</p>
                  <p>As there are these ways of communion, differing from Government; so there are <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vide Zanch. in Eph.</hi> 4. <hi>in Tom.</hi> 6. <hi>oper.</hi>
                     </note> certain Tyes and Bands, some more general, some more special among all Churches, by which this communion is to be exercised, as appeareth by <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>There is 1. That General Tye and Obligation of the Church-Catholick, which we acknowledge to be the chief Fundamental Relation or Obligation (Transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:154381:118"/> above all others) of communion of Churches: the other particular being but several Respects and Relations, that do knit more fastly by vertue of it. </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We do acknowledge that every particular Church is to be considered as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church-Catholick, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27, the Apostle speaks of the Universal Body, in the words afore, and in the words after. But although it be a part of the Church Universal, yet not of the Church Universal, considered as a Ministerial Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that hath Jurisdiction in it; but as being a Mystical Body, and it is therefore obliged to perform to other Churches, by vertue of this Catholick Obligation, only all such Duties of Christian communion, as proceedeth in a Mystical way, as hath been shewn. So as we profess our selves wronged, to have this put upon us, that in gathering of Churches, we make separate Churches from all the World; but do acknowledge as many, and as great Duties in a way of communion, to lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and all other Churches, as according to their Assertion, there are Duties of exercising Jurisdiction and Subjection, respectively among themselves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are to look also to the other Churches Elders, as Elders, and accordingly to Reverence them; but yet not as Elders, they carry Jurisdiction over all Churches, about with them. It will be hard to shew wherein Ministers have power of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over Persons that belong not to their own Churches.</p>
                  <p>If it be acknowledged that they are Elders, and so to be looked upon by other Churches; yet still but by vertue, and in the way of a Mystical communion, as all things in the World are the Saints, 1 Cor. 3. 21, 22. <hi>Therefore let no Man glory in Men, for all things are yours: Whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the World, or Life, or Death, or things present, or things to come, all are yours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, there are two things to be considered in every Elder. There is first his Separation unto the work of the Ministry, and unto Christ, that he is Dedicated, and set apart to him: And then in the second place, there is his Relation of an Elder, to this or that particular Church.</p>
                  <p>Now his particular Relation of an Elder to this or that Church, may cease by the Churches ceasing, by the Death of the Members, or by his Removal or Absence, when yet his Separation to Christ, and the Relation that is between Christ and him, continueth: It is here, as in the case of Widdows, as they were Dedicated to Christ, as Widdows, and should have waxed wanton against Christ, if they had Marryed; so <hi>he,</hi> if <hi>he</hi> should (unless upon an absolute necessity) divert to another calling, he would offend against Christ. And if his Relation to a Church, should thus cease; yet the Blessing of Christ, in Respect of his Dedication to him, might follow him in his Preaching unto those, who yet perhaps would not acknowledge him to be their Elder, in Respect of Relation to them. And the power of Jurisdiction, that he hath together with other Elders, is (for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it) in Respect of his fixed Relation to that particular Church, to whom he is an Elder: And therefore, although in many Ministerial Acts, he may have the Blessing of an Elder secretly accompanying of him from Christ; yet he cannot claim the power of an Elder, in respect of Jurisdiction. The Apostles themselves, had the Blessing of Apostles, and Ministers of Christ in their Preaching to them that were without; and yet they had not a Jurisdiction Ecclesiastical over them that were without; <hi>What have I to do to Judge them that are without?</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
                  <p>Again, our Divines have Distinguished, that there is <hi>Potestas ordinis,</hi> and <hi>Potestas Jurisdictionis,</hi> in Ministers and Elders; <hi>Power of Order,</hi> and <hi>Power of Jurisdiction;</hi> and that there are Acts, which are Acts of meer Power of Order of his Office, as an Elder, which he may perform alone, as to Preach, and the like; and that power he may carry along with him, where ever he goes; because he performs it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally, in respect of his Dedication to God and Christ: But the power of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction is a farther thing, which therefore he exerciseth with other Elders; and with other Elders not materially considered, but as formed up into the Relation of Presbytery, to a Church which is to be the Seat of it. Power of Jurisdiction, is an External power, and therefore dependeth upon an External Relation to Men; but the Blessing and Power, that accompanieth his Ministerial Acts, to Preach, and the like, that depends principally upon his being Dedicated unto God, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and hath a more special Relation to God, according to which Relation, Men where ever he cometh, Reverence him, and receive him; and the Blessing of God
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:154381:118"/> may accompany him. And therefore this power of Jurisdiction with others is not to be extended beyond the Seat, the Church, to which he hath Relation. As is the case also of Magistrates, if you could suppose, that besides the Relation of a King to his People, in respect of which, he hath a Jurisdiction as a King over them, that there were such a Dedication and Separation of him to this Office, that where ever he came, he were a King in respect of some Acts, had a Kingly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Kingly Wisdom, to give Counsel in an Diety or Assembly of King's and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the World, he might be received in all such, to perform such Acts; when yet he could not perform an Act of Jurisdiction; because that's founded upon that special Relation he hath to his own People.</p>
                  <p>And it is in respect of the communion of Churches, and other Elders, as it is in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Churches, and the Brethren of other Churches. If the Brethren of other Churches, few or more, occasionally come to a particular Church in a City, where, a Mart of Men coming from many Cities, is kept, if they receive them to all the meer Priviledges of that Church, by vertue of their Church-communion; yet they would not receive them, so as to sit and Vote with them, in the choice of Officers, or the like; because that's an Act that properly concerns that particular Church, whereof he is to be an Officer. So answerably, a particular Church, may receive the Elders of other Churches, and receive them as Elders, in respect of some Acts, as Preaching and the like; but not in respect of Acts of Jurisdiction, which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Brethren themselves, would deny to the Elders of other Churches: As for example, if upon an occasion, the Elders of other Churches, belonging to other Presbyteries, should be present at some one classical Presbytery, although they would receive them as Elders, and Reverence them as such; yet they would not have them to sit with them, and Vote, so as that the Vote of those Stranger Elders, which yet they acknowledge Elders, should over-rule, or cast the Acts of their Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They would perhaps hear their Advice, and their Judgment as Elders, but not admit them to Acts of Jurisdiction, and Eccesiastical Authority; because that <hi>that</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon Relation to such a Seat or Corporation of several Churches, according to their Principles; but, to the Seat of a particular Congregational Church, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ours.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. X.</head>
                  <argument>
                     <p>That though it were granted, that the Elders of one Church, might exercise Acts of Authority and Jurisdiction in another, occasionally and when called to do so by that Church; yet from this cannot he concluded, that Authority over particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregations, which our Presbyterian Brethren challenge.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>BUT if the Elders of other Churches, were capable to exercise the Acts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction occasionally in some cases over Churches (which they have not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Relation of Eldership unto) by vertue of the Catholick communion of Churches, yet the Seat in which, and the Bounds of Extent, over which this Jurisdiction should be exercised, must still be only a particular Congregation. And the call by which this Jurisdiction is to be exercised, should be occasionally from that Congregation, in case of want or need; which therefore should, in such cases, stand in stead of a fixed and a constant Relation, that Elders do bear to that Church, the call being occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and from themselves, in case of need, as the Jurisdiction they exercise is but meerly occasional, and for that time. And so by this means, still as the right bounds, that Christ hath Instituted for the Seat of Jurisdiction, is kept unto, and not exceeded; so the power of the Congregation it self, is hereby also preserved. But it is another thing, which by vertue of the Catholick communion of Churches, and the Elders thereof, that the Presbyterian Divines do challenge, and would erect, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Principles. They do challenge an Association, to be an Institution of Christ; by vertue of which, the greater company of Elders of other Churches may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume and challenge a power over any Congregation in that Association; and so erect a constant and an ordinary consistory, whereby not only the bounds and limits set
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:154381:119"/> by Christ, for the Seat of Jurisdiction, are transgressed and exceeded; but an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power is erected, and set over the Churches; not only in respect of the constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it, but in respect also of the want of that Relation, of being Elders to them, which is the Foundation of the constant exercise of Jurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>So as the question will not be, whether by vertue of this Catholick communion, a particular Congregation may make use of the Elders of another Congregation, to Ordain, to assist them in Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so they may come to have power in a particular Church, by their special and peculiar call, for such an Act at such a time, (though this will not be acknowledged by us) but the question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Christ's Institution, they may erect a Judicatory, and challenge a Subjection from all the Churches. In the other way, the Congregations do not Subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor their Liberty, but make use of that Ministry of an Elder, which Christ hath put upon them: Even as in Arbitrations, or in References unto other Churches, they do not Subject themselves to other Churches, it being done occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, and by their consent, whom they would single out to be the Arbitrators. So as it is one thing, that there may occasionally be an exercising of an Elder's power, in another's Congregation, and it is another thing, that it should be assumed and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (which is the thing that remains further to be proved by the Presbyterial Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) as it is one thing for a Child under Age, though he should not govern himself, to have liberty to choose a Guardian for the time; but it is another thing, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Men should assume to be his Guardians for ever. It would be one thing for a Corporation to send to another Corporation for their Recorder, a Man skillful in the Law, to perform the Office of a Recorder, with a Jury at their Sessions, they now wanting one, or there falling out a case of Difficulty, wherein their own doth need assistance: But it would be another thing, for the Recorders of several Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a County, to go and challenge by vertue of Association, and the common Law of communion in the Kingdom, a constant power of Jurisdiction to be exercised over them.</p>
                  <p>And in this case, the communion of Churches in respect of Members, <hi>Qua</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and of Elders <hi>Qua</hi> Elders, answer one another, according to our Principles. For as the Members of another Church, if they come to a particular Church, and are received by their consent by them (and so for that time, become as one Body with them, by vertue whereof, they receive the Sacrament amongst them, as being for this Act incorporated, and as one bread with them occasionally) in this do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive meerly and simply, as Members of another Church, distinctly and a-part consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, although by vertue of their being Members of another Church; but they are thereby for that time, occasionally received into that Church, <hi>ad tantum, so far,</hi> as to enjoy such and such a Priviledge: So as the Sacrament in this, is not said to be given to the Members of two Churches a-part considered, but to one Church, as thus making one, tho' upon a differing respect. And so it is also in their receiving Elders (if we may make that Supposition) to perform Acts of Eldership occasionally, they do it not in this single and a-part consideration, that they are simply Elders of other Churches, as if considered only as such, they may make a consistory met out of this Church, to be over this Church, and so Excommunicate; but they come to, and are present in and with that Church, being called by them, and received as Elders for that Act, and for that time, as one with them: So as the Acts which they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form are acts as of that Church, or of Elders in that Church, and are not to be considered as acts of other Elders that have power over that Church.</p>
                  <p>Though Ministers thus should be supposed to have, in respect of their Dedication to God and to Christ, a passive capacity to be used for any Ministerial Act in any Church, by vertue of the communion of Churches; yet it would be electively, and upon the call of that Church: But that they should have an active power, so as to come unto Congregations, and say, we ought to have this power amongst you, by vertue of Christ's Institution, and you ought to Associate with us, for all Acts of Government in common; and thus to challenge, as Elders, a power, upon occasion, in any or all Churches in the World, this is that which was properly the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of an Apostle. The greatest thing in the Apostles, for their extent of power, lay in this, not only that when they came to a Church, they were capable of being called to joyn with a Sister Presbytery, and Eldership, when they wanted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Elders; but it lay in this, that when ever they came to any Church, they
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:154381:119"/> could challenge this as having an Universal call as Apostles, from Jesus Christ; and so they had Authority active, which they might assume. And if it were granted by us, that ordinary Ministers succeed the Apostles so far, as to have a passive capacity and power to be called to exercise their Ministry, in all or any Church; yet to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the other, were to step into the Apostles Throne. The power of Authority of Jurisdiction is an active thing, not a passive, it is not as a dead Instrument that may be used; it is not simply to have the Gift and Ability to Judge, but it is to have the Power and Authority to Judge; which if the Church should not call them unto, they might call upon the Church, regarding it to be their Duty to exercise it for them. As the power of Government, or Jurisdiction of a King, is not a meer passive capacity, but it is a power to command them that are under him, which he is to perform and exercise among them. It is the Authority that gives the calling.</p>
                  <p>And in this respect, the Arguments that our Brethren use to bring, that Elders may exercise some Acts of Elders in others Churches, as that they may Preach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are to be received as Elders in other Churches, by vertue of the Catholick communion of Churches, are no way sufficient to prove and establish that Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their way. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It doth not follow, because they may do one Act of Ministry, as of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Administring the Sacrament, that therefore they may do all; no more than it would follow, that because a Man may Preach alone, Baptize alone of himself; that therefore of himself alone, he may exercise Jurisdiction. Unto Acts of Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction there is a Formality, and the Formality doth lie in their Relation to such or such a Seat or Subject, over whom the Jurisdiction is exercised, and so and so bounded, and that by special Institution.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will not follow, that if they may exercise as Elders one Act of Ministry, therefore all of Jurisdiction; because there may be some Acts of Ministry, which are properly belonging to the Church Universal, as Universal, and such Acts we judge Preaching, and Baptizing to be; and therefore we read, that Baptism was done both out of a Church Relation, and without the presence of a Church, as the Baptizing of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> by <hi>Philip.</hi> But so Ordination is not, so the Lord's Supper is not; Baptism we rather take to be an Ordinance of the Church Universal, <hi>One Faith, One Lord, One Baptism, Eph.</hi> 4. 5. But the Lord's Supper is an Ordinance of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, making one Body, and one Bread, and consisteth in a communion. One Apostle, and one Man, could not receive the Supper of the Lord together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they could not make one Church, for this is made essential to it, 1 Cor. 10. <hi>We being many, are one Bread;</hi> therefore it is called, <hi>the Communion of the Body of Christ.</hi> But one Apostle may Baptize one Man when alone, and so we think one Minister may do it at this day, if he had converted him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Elders of other Churches should have power to Judge and Determine things in a Doctrinal way, to give the Rule upon occasion; it will not follow, that they have the power of Juridical Application, of Excommunication according to that Rule. The Apostles might deliver the Doctrine of Faith, as Apostles to them that were without, when yet they could not Juridically judge them that were without. The <hi>Pharisees</hi> by their Doctrine, did bind Burthens upon Men's Consciences, and that in their Sermons, when they Sat in <hi>Moses</hi> his Chair, when yet they did not bind by way of censure. Yea, every Minister may Doctrinally deliver the Rule, when yet alone, and that as a Minister he cannot exercise an Act of Jurisdiction. We see this in civil power in Kingdoms, the Judges of the Kingdom altogether met cannot condemn a Man, without a Jury, though they may deliver what is Law, and say what is the Rule. Yea, though the House of Commons in Parliament, in an extraordinary way, by way of Bill, may adjudge a Man to Death, yet in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry course, they are not Witnesses to the Fact; and although they have power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the Laws in the Kingdom, they do not give an Oath, as the House of Peers doth. The Assembly that now Sitteth, they are betrusted with power in a Doctrinal <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines at</hi> Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> way, to give their Judgments what shall Reform the Kingdom; and their Judgment herein is to be looked upon, as the Judgment of so many Elders of several Churches; but they have not power to Administer a censure.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because they may come to have as Elders, Authority in any Church, in the way forementioned, occasionally, electively (the power of the Church being seen, in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:154381:120"/> them upon such an occasion together to assist them, and to be present with them, they exercising that power but in that Church, and joyntly with that Church, and as an entire Act of that Church, whereto for the present, they perform the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Elders) it will not follow, that therefore they may in all Churches, usurp a power over them, and call upon them, and challenge it from them. This will not follow from the other, because, as was said, the Priviledge of Government is given unto the Church, as the Seat of it, and is therefore to be drawn down to it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in it, and not to be claimed out of it.</p>
                  <p>The one therefore running thus in a Natural Moral way, the other by a special In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, forming up a Body on purpose, and arming it with a power, over and above what the Natural Law of communion and Non-communion reacheth to, which is to deliver unto Satan, and to perform all Acts of Admonition and Censure, in order thereunto: Hence therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This commuion with other Churches, is not in a fixed set way, but occasional. The <hi>Synhedrim</hi> was a Set and a fixed Court, and therefore by Institution; but this communion is but as the communion of Saints one with another, in a general way. Hence,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It being in a Moral way to other Churches, and the Elders thereof, therefore the Obligation for matters of ending of controversies, is answerable and suitable. They are not bound to go to the next Neighbour-Church, but to any other whom they do most Reverence, or who are most fit and proper to end the controversie; therefore <hi>Antioch</hi> sent to <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> If it were by Institution, it would take in the Neighbour-Churches, as in the case of Murther, the next City was to make an Atonement. When <hi>James</hi> doth bid us confess our Sins one to another, in case a Man be so troubled with Lust, so that he is called to confess it to another, the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not require him necessarily to confess it to his Minister, or to the next Saint or Brother he meeteth; for it is not laid upon him in a way of Institution, but upon a Moral ground, and answerably he is Morally to consider who is the fittest Man to confess this Sin unto, and will be Faithful and Secret, and is able to ease him; so that it runs not in a way of Institution of Set Persons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence therefore, that Neighbour-Churches should have a Ground and a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to call a Neighbour-Church in question, or to an account, is not by way of Power and Authority, as, if it ran in a way of Institution, it should be; but it is by way of Offence, and therefore they are to do it, when they are offended with their proceedings, and with their miscarriages. So then, as the Subjection of a Man or a Brother, in the case of Offence, to forbear such a practice, which is otherwise indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent to him, is not by vertue of any Authority his Brother hath over him, but it is in a Moral way; so it is in this case.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whereas the Analogy of <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. is urged to be as well between a Church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and other Churches, as between a Brother and a Congregation; that when they are offended, they are to tell it to a greater number of Churches. We shall not be against this Analogy, for the like way of proceeding; only we are against the like Authority of proceeding. If other Churches will deal with a Sister-Church, in the way of Moral communion specified, let them observe the same Analogy, and we shall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it; but if they will erect from that Analogy the like Authority and Power of Jurisdiction, unto that we deny the Analogy to reach; because that in the Church-Universal, and the communion thereof as such, Christ hath placed no such Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>

                  <p>AS there is the general Bond of which I have Discoursed, that knits all Churches together, which, like to that which the Apostle speaks of charity, is above all, and runs through all, and gives Strength to all other, so there are more special

                  <p>And herein we give and acknowledge much to those National Relations of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under one common civil Government, if considered as a bond or Tye, which makes the communion more near, and occasioneth more obligation of Duty. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so there is a closer communion between Churches, that are more near, Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the same City, and the same Vicinity; because they have a more special occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of converse, and of knowing each other's Affairs. But yet still all those Bonds and Tyes, by which Churches are thus knit together, doth not give Neighbour-Churches, or a National Church, power of Jurisdiction. For it runs in a way of that Mystical communion of the Church Universal; only there is a ground and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of exercising that communion more nearly. Thus in the Churches of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many Advantages do arise (we acknowledge) unto Churches thereby, as that they have the benefit of the common Laws, to protect them under the Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, who is to be a Nursing Father, and a Nursing Mother to them; and so to unite them together, and make that Mystical communion more entire. But the power of the Magistrate cannot set up, or form them into any other Ecclesiastical Power and Government than Jesus Christ hath Instituted. What communion Christ would have to be amongst Churches, the Magistrate may exact of them, and keep them to it; but he cannot raise up a new kind of communion, their having one Language, their having one Government, makes a greater nearness of it. The Apostles Write therefore unto the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> as in one Nation, or in one Province. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> Writing to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> Writes to the Saints of <hi>Achaia,</hi> and many Churches in <hi>Achaia,</hi> may be called <hi>Achaia,</hi> for so it is in the Apostles Stile; <hi>Achaia was ready a year agoe</hi> (saith he, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 2.) meaning many Churches in <hi>Achaia.</hi> So we may say <hi>England,</hi> for the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> and the Name may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the Nation, but the Name with the word <hi>Church,</hi> is never put together, as being a <hi>National Church,</hi> cast into one Body, in respect of Ecclesiastical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Jurisdiction, as the Kingdom is for civil Government. The Apostle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he Writes to Churches of a Nation, calling them Churches and not Church, doth argue, that the common Relation between them, was by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, each Reserving their Jurisdiction as several Churches, but not as cast under one Jurisdiction, as being one Church. Yea, perhaps the Name <hi>Church</hi> may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto a Nation in a Mystical Respect; that which is given to the whole, being given to any part or number of Saints. The Strangers that were scattered all over lesser <hi>Asia,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. are called <hi>a Flock,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. And so our Saviour Christ saith, he had Sheep that were not of that Fold, <hi>i. e.</hi> that were not of that Nation, but that were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and yet they are both called one Church in the General; for he would make them (both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile)</hi> one Fold; but they are so called, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their Mystical Relation, as under him their Shepherd, not in respect of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the <hi>Jews</hi> that were Scattered, a Flock in the General, distinct from the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> because they could not perhaps understand the Tongues of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and therefore kept together, as <hi>Jews</hi> distinct.</p>
                  <p>So then we shall grant very far to National communion of Churches kept in a Mystical way. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Yet we understand this in the same sense, as</hi> Revel. 5. 9. <hi>interprets it, of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed out of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so that all the people in Nations, will never grow up to be Members of Churches, especially, not till the call of the</hi> Jews.</note> We grant, that God under the Gospel, hath made a covenant with, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise unto Nations (in respect of the Gospel) as well as unto Families. <hi>Paul</hi> when some in <hi>Achaia,</hi> had received the Gospel, calls them <hi>the first Fruits of</hi> Achaia, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 5. He calls them the first Fruits, as a sign that more would come of the same Nation; but he would not Baptize Men of the same Nation upon it, or upon a bare outward profession, as the Apostles did not therefore Baptize all the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> because some received the Gospel as the first Fruits. <hi>Abraham's</hi> covenant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed goes to Nations, as well as to Families; Esa. 52. 15. <hi>He shall sprinkle many Nations.</hi> And God removes the Light of the Gospel from Nations, as well as from particular Churches. The Gospel it self becomes a National Blessing; and we see
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:154381:121"/> that one Nation hath more light in one Age than another; as the <hi>Grecians</hi> and those in <hi>Asia</hi> once had, and now we <hi>Europeans,</hi> in the Northern parts have. That part of <hi>Brittain</hi> which is now called <hi>Wales,</hi> had it more than the rest of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when <hi>Austin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> came into this Island, those that opposed him, being only found there, whereas now the whole Kingdom hath had it since, and the Gospel becometh a National Blessing; and when the Practices and Priviledges of it are Established by the Law, it cometh to be a National Right. And when the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magistrate by Law doth countenance Religion, God doth bless the Nation, and bless the Magistrate for it, as he did the House of <hi>Obededom,</hi> for the Ark's resting there, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are National Duties, which the Churches in a Nation, as they are a Nation, owe unto God in a joynt way, as to keep Solemn Fasts and Days of Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for National Blessings, or for threatned Judgments, as <hi>Nineveh</hi> did.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In case that the Churches of a Nation are corrupted, they may have Assemblies and Conferences, where mutually it may be seen, what light these Churches can hold forth; so to make a Reformation, and to become a new lump, they may have such Assemblies, to direct them to do it. In <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had Elders to come one to another, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Eze.</hi> 20. 1. but they had not the power of a <hi>Synhedrim,</hi> which was Instituted by God, that was only proper to them, while they were in the Land; and the promise was to it, as being in the place that God should choose. They came to enquire, but not to judge; and the Prophet was with them, who yet had not the power of Jurisdiction as a Prophet. Or otherwise at other times, we acknowledge, that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Assemblies may be chosen out by Parliament for National Respects, to advise them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And by vertue of oneness of Language, and of Affinity, Churches in one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are able (by vertue of this Bond, as a Band and Tye to knit together) to edifie one another more than other Churches; as by Writing Books in the same Language, speaking the same Tongue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, and as they are Churches in a Nation, as they walk more exactly, God will give such a Nation more light than he doth another Nation. These, and many more such Advantages as these are, in ways of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we do acknowledge belong to them as a Nation; and the same also, by reason of Neighbourhood to Neighbour-Churches.</p>
                  <p>But to cast all these Churches into such a National Government Ecclesiastical, and such Subordinations as Presbyterian Government casts them into (such as being a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in respect of civil Government, they are cast into) and that they should be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in respect of a National Bond to an uniformity, or obliged for uniformities sake, to the same Pitch and Model, that one particular Church, should not practise further than another, or hold forth more light in matters of Doctrine than another; but that there must be one Standard for all, and that they should be obliged to this, by vertue of a National constitution, such an Uniformity as this, we think is prejudicial to the Churches; the Apostles Rule holding in this, that so far as we have attained, we should walk by the same Rule. So the Churches in a Nation, may meet to see how far they have attained, and to convince one another, and so Establish by common consent, a common Rule amongst them so far; but so as that if any be otherwise minded, they should wait in this, till God Reveal it in his time; for otherwise the purer Churches, which will still be the fewer, must be kept and conformed to the light of the impurer, which would some corrupt them. And the greater compass is taken, to make the uniformity, still it will be the worse; because the greater part is still more corrupt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore for meer uniformities sake, to make a general Rule, that should bind weak and strong alike, when that general Rule also, is made in favour of the weak only (as to prescribe forms of Prayer, because many, or the most of Ministers, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray conceived Prayer, or to make one and the same form of Government for all Churches; because many or most Churches, have not Ministers, or a People fit to Govern, or to give Prudential Rules for Worship, which should bind all; because some Elders of Churches as now constituted, have not wisdom to direct themselves, and yet are suffered still to be Elders) thus to bind up both weak and strong, under the same Rule, and to Restrain the one, for the sake of the other, we think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s contrary to the Apostolical Rule. As Men in a personal walking, are to be left to a more or less purity,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:154381:121"/> so Churches too, and there is no reason, that those that have a further light, should be Retarded by those that have not.</p>
                  <p>And that which we say of the Churches of a Nation, may in their several respects (so far as the Bond or Tye will hold) be said of the Churches in a City, or in any Neighbourhood: Yet so, as we conceive, that always Neighbourhood is not so near a Bond to induce Churches to Associate, as correspondency of Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As in <hi>Germany,</hi> where there are Churches that are <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, others that are of the <hi>Calvinist's,</hi> the Neighbourhood is not so near a Tye or Bond, as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Principles to Associate themselves; tho' this principle is to be held Sacred, by vertue of the universal Catholick communion, that so far hold forth as Churches have any thing that is good in them, so far forth (whether in respect of Doctrine or Worship, or the like) there is to be a communion held with them (when in practice there cannot, yet, in judgment there ought to be) to acknowledge them the Churches of Christ, and the Ministers of Christ, and approve whatever is good in them; and if in one practice we cannot joyn, yet in others we may. This we do acknowledge, to be the universal Law of communion between Church and Church, throughout the World.</p>
                  <p>And we do acknowledge that it is possible, that a Congregational Government may be adequate with a Nation. For if it were a Nation of all visible Saints, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules of the Word (as the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when called perhaps shall be, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 28.) then the Nation and the Church, would be adequate. But a few in Nations, come to be Saints; and then the Government must be suited to them. And if you would make a Rule for a whole Nation, where there is but a few Saints, tho' the whole profess Christian Religion; then the Rulers, whereby Jesus Christ would have his Churches Governed, as by the Peoples choosing the Officers, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples having an interest in censures, would not universally be applicable, and such a Government would not suit to a whole Nation, in a Congregational way; but the fault is not in the Government, but it lies in the Persons. <hi>Castellus Bononiensis,</hi> would say that the Old Government of Churches would not be available, <hi>Nisi Ecclesiae quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que statum antiquum obtineat.</hi> The Rules whereby Jesus Christ would have his Church Governed, will not suit Churches, unless they have that State and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Members, which in the Apostle's times they had, which, in the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christianity in a Nation and Parishes, as now more generally they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in respect of Members, cannot be.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That though no Church or Churches have the power to Excommunicate any other Churches, yet they have Authority of declaring Non-communion with them, upon occasion of just offence given.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE upshot of the difference, between us and our Brethren, lies in this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; that all Church-Government, consisting in a Spiritual Instituted Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or being in order to it, which is properly called a censure and an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment by the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. (for that is properly Government, which hath a power inflicting of punishment as such) now Excommunication being properly a Spiritual punishment, in a strict Sense so taken; hence therefore, where that only is placed, there is the Government placed, in a strict Sense. And that which makes Excommunication, as it differs from Non-communion, to be a punishment, lies in this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is a delivering up to Satan, which because it Superaddeth to the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Person or Persons from external communion, which is common to it, with that which we call Non-communion; therefore it must be a special Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cannot be founded upon a natural ground, for who hath power to give up a Person to Satan, when any Church hath thrown him out, but only Christ? And hence other Churches, after a particular Church hath Excommunicated a Man, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Excommunicate him further, they cannot give him up to Satan again; for that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:154381:122"/> Act is already done, if he be rightly Excommunicated, and all their Act can be but a pronouncing Non-communion. </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Excommunication and Non-communion differ thus, that in Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Person is to look upon himself, as cast out of communion with Christ, and he hath his sins Judicially bound upon his conscience, not only in a Doctrinal way (for so his sins are bound, when a Brother reproveth him) but as by such an Ordinance, wherein Jesus Christ doth, as as a Judge from Heaven, bind his sin upon his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, having promised to do so, upon the Churches binding sin upon him; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring Non-communion, they do not a-new Judicially bind his sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In Non-communion, there is not so much an Authoritative Act over others, as an endeavour to keep themselves pure. It is indeed an Authoritative Act over others in this Sense, or the Church that doth keep another Church, or the Persons of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church from communion with them exercise Authority in this Sense, that they having Authority from Christ positively, to partake in such and such Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to receive Men thereunto, they receive only such and such Members (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though of other Churches) and refuse others. Both these Acts are comparatively (take both positive and negative together) Acts of Authority; for they proceed by way of consequence, from the Authority they have to Administer ordinances amongst themselves: Yet the keeping out of that Person is not an Act of Jurisdiction over that Person, as the keeping out of an Heathen is not an Act of Jurisdiction over him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Look what difference is between Suspension from the Sacrament and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication within a particular Church; the same may serve to express the difference of Excommunication and Non-communion by other Churches. The Act of Suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Sacrament is but by vertue of the Mystical communion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all Saints; but Excommunication is by vertue of the communion, which the Members of a particular Church, have one with another.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that they differ thus, that Suspension is but for a time; but Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is a Final Sentence: The Answer is, that even Suspension is for ever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Man Repents, as well as Excommunication; but they differ only in this, that the one is a withdrawing from a Brother to keep themselves, and the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pure; but the other is an Authoritative giving him up to Satan, in the Name of the Lord Jesus. Suspension therefore is after the Sin, till they try whether he will Repent or no; but Excommunication is when they have tryed, and they see he doth not Repent.</p>
                  <p>Of Non communion, there may be two grounds.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The one is when a Church urgeth, suppose in some one Ordinance (as kneeling at the Lord's Supper) that practice upon a Person which to him is Sin, although in all other Respects, that Church to him, is as pure a Church as any is in the World. In this case he is forced to a Non-communion, that is, to a forbearing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them in that practice, and in that Ordinance, wherein especially pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick communion with the Saints lies: And this is done without any censuring of that Church; but only professing his not being able to see that light and ground, upon which he should have communion with them in it. Therefore those that leave other Churches upon such grounds, do not pronounce a Sentence of Non-communion with those Churches; but do it meerly and only to keep themselves pure and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another ground, or perhaps a Second kind of Non-communion is this, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Church or Churches do judge another Church or Churches to be corrupt in their Doctrine, or in their countenancing such gross Sins, for which Men should be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, and so are offended at those Churches; which being Admonished, do not Repent, but continue obstinate. Now such a kind of Non-communion in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is materially for such kind of Sins, and ought not to be for such, as for which in a particular Church, Excommunication is to be Denounced against a Member or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: And so both the one and the other do agree.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the object matter of offence, for which, Men proceed to the one or the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They may agree in this, that for the external Act they are the same, and for the consequences of it too, so far as lies in their practice one toward another externally. For the outward substance of the Act, they are both a denying outward commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:154381:122"/> in Ordinances; and also for the consequent Act, they are both of them a deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion in ordinary converse.</p>
                  <p>Then 3. They agree in the Analogy of their proceedings, that as in a particular Church, in Admonitions tending to Excommunication upon Impenitency (upon which Excommunication follows) there are these degrees of proceedings; first to take two or three privately, then to give two or three Admonitions in a publick way, e're they proceed to Excommunication: So should other Churches deal with a Sister-Church offending, e're they proceed to Non-communion.</p>
                  <p>If the question be askt, what Institution there is for Non-communion: We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There needs no Institution for it, since it ariseth from all the former Principles, and is not an Act of censure by way of Institution; but according to the Law of Nature; And as the Saints are taught of God to love one another, so they are taught of God to withdraw, and also any Church to withdraw from those that live inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately. As the Mystical communion runs in a natural way, by Reason of the Law of Love that is in the Hearts of all the Saints, so doth the Law of Non-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It cannot be said that there is no Warrant: For 1. The same Precept that Warrants Suspension, Warrants this; Namely, the withdrawing from a Brother that walks inordinately, as to what is in their power to give or refuse him Fellowship in, and it is in the power of one Church, to give or refuse Fellowship to other Churches in their Ordinances. So that it cannot be alledged, that there is not a command for it, but only that there is not an Institution for it; it is a Duty, though not an Act of Authority. 2. That which Warrants any Christian not to bid an Heretick good speed, which yet is not an Act of Jurisdiction, nor to receive them into their Houses, Warrants also this. 3. That which Warranted <hi>Timothy,</hi> being a Minister to Guide and Direct the Churches, <hi>to turn away from those who had only</hi> a form of <hi>Godliness, denying the power of it</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.) Warrants also this Non-communion of which we are Discoursing. It was Written to him by way of Prophecy, and so to all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and Churches in the latter Age, when the profession of Christianity should grow as common, and be carryed by the same grounds of common Education and Imperial Laws, as the <hi>Pagan</hi> Religion before had been. When before (all in a general implicit way, thus professing Christianity, the Churches might be in danger of being defiled, by holding communion indifferently with all, since the case is such, that many should have a Form of Godliness, and deny the power of it, although professing Religion: Therefore (saith the Apostle) from such turn away. 4. What one Apostle did to another in case of offence, the same one Church may do to another, upon the same grounds. One Apostle had not power to Excommunicate another in a way of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; neither had <hi>Paul</hi> power to Excommunicate <hi>Peter,</hi> or Admonish him in an Authoritative way; but to Admonish him by way of that Mystical communion, which all Saints owe one to another, and so was due from one Apostle to another. <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly did Admonish <hi>Peter,</hi> and withstand him to his Face. And when in that contention between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Barnabas</hi> was in the wrong (for he went upon a carnal ground, because <hi>Mark</hi> was his Sisters Son, and so therefore he would have him along with him, though formerly he Deserted the Service; for which <hi>Paul</hi> would not take him into Fellowship with them) they, upon this occasion, part Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship one from another, and <hi>Paul</hi> did justly do it from <hi>Barnabas,</hi> though he could not Excommunicate him.</p>
                  <p>If the question be, why Jesus Christ should put this Ordinance of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and delivering up to Satan, in a particular Church, rather than in a Multitude of other Churches: I answer, although the Reason of Institutions is only the Will of Christ; yet all his constitutions are consonant to Spiritual Reasons, and the consonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this particular instance to Spiritual Reasons may appear in this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because in the proceeding of other Churches with another Church offending, they can have but half that power as present to concur in it, which the Ordinance of Christ hath setled Excommunication upon. For there cannot both Elders and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple meet in Synods ordinarily; and yet in a Congregation, both Elders and People must concur to Excommunication, as a Judge and a Jury use to do. Now to suppose that the power of this Ordinance should be Transferred to those that have but half the interest, to a company of Elders only, where the concurrence of the People as
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:154381:123"/> present is wanting: To suppose that in a Congregation both these should concur, and that in a Synod which hath the greater power but one of these should concur, would not be uniform to this Ordinance. Dealings with other Churches, must be Transact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Commissions, and by way of Representation; and the power of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is not given to a Representative company. And for these to have power to take upon them to Excommunicate not only Persons, but Churches, when yet to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Persons in a Church, both People and Elders concur, is yet less imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again this Honour God hath given to his Church of Saints, that if the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Authority of Jesus Christ be not placed in them; yet virtually it should be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised as amongst them, so as the unanimous concurrence of their Spirits, as well as of the Ministers, should have an influence unto this Ordinance, or should be conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant to this Ordinance; and that therefore the power of Jesus Christ should be put forth, 1 Cor. 5. 4. <hi>When you are gathered together,</hi> both Elders and People. As the vertue of the Load-stone is then put forth, when it is set in Steel, and as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative power of an Act of the King and State is exerted, when both Houses of Parliament are met, and in their Presence; without which it would not be an Act of Authority, to Ratifie and Establish Laws; so is here: The power of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, to deliver a Man up to Satan, must be in the presence of the People: And as tho' the Eye alone sees, yet, as Seated in such a Body; so suppose all the power should be in the Elders, by which a Man is delivered up to Satan, yet, in the Elders, as Seated in this Church. And therefore to take a company of Elders abstracted from their People, Jesus Christ hath not given this power unto them, as the Laws of this Kingdom hath not thought fit to give the power of condemning any Man to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es alone, but as concurring with the Jury.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The enjoyment of a constant communion, as in a Congregation formed up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fixed Body for Worship, is only proper to a particular Congregation, and the Members thereof; therefore the throwing out of such an enjoyment, out of such a Body (having this punishment annexed to it, to be given up to Satan when he is thrown out) is most proper to it, rather than to any other Body, where a Man comes but to meet occasionally: And as it only is the Seat of fixed Worship, so it only is the Seat of throwing one out of the Seat of Worshippers, and of delivering him up to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. And the nature of the Ordinance is such as that it could be placed but in one Seat; and therefore that Seat which hath it first should only have it; or a Man can be delivered to Satan but once.</p>
                  <p>Now the next question will be, how far this Law of communion of Churches will draw on a Subjection of one Church to another, and will tend to order Churches? And what proceeding by vertue hereof, one Church may have toward another, and what one Church, or many Churches, is to give to any Church?</p>
                  <p>We lay this for a general ground, that as there are particular Duties, and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the external part all the same kind of Duties, which are to pass between a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, and the Members thereof; therefore by Analogy, there may be the same proceedings used, and courses taken for the discharge of these Duties between Church and Church occasionally, as is amongst the others. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is an obligation of one Church over another, by vertue of this commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; to enquire in case of Jealousie, or common Fame and Report, how it fares with them? And therefore there may be an Association of Churches, whereby (in the meetings of their Elders or others Deputed) there may be enquiries of Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, which may be equivalent to those of Annual Visitations, which have been amongst us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If that Persons wronged do complain, and their complaints do arise to that Height and Appearance of Injustice, as that there is a just offence occasioned: In such cases, or in what ever other cases of Miscarriages, one Church or many Churches are bound to give an account; and in cases doubtful, to give Oaths to clear things; and to Swear Witnesses to help to find out the Truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the Judging part, they may declare against Churches, by way of Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Doctrinally, that they have thus and thus Transgressed the Rule. They may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them as having Sinned against light, as perverters of the Faith; they may Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish them and Threaten them in the Name of Christ; that is, for his Name (his Name is put for his Honour) and so for his Honour's sake, that is called upon
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:154381:123"/> them; his Name is put also for power. They may declare that they are offended as a Church, and that it is a Church Act as from them, and so deal with them, as a Church offended with a Church Delinquent; but still they act not by a power over them given by Institution from Christ: They do not Act from a power of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering up to Satan; but only with the power of Christ's word, and Threatnings laid a-fore the offending Church.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When by way of Sentence, they profess to hold no communion with them; that Sentence yet is not that of Excommunication, for therein tho' they exercise Church-power over their own selves, in Relation to themselves, binding themselves as a Church, not to have communion with them; yet it is not an Act of Authority over them: As a Lord of a Mannor meddles not with anothers Mill, when he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts his Tenants to grind there; for it is not an Act of Jurisdiction over the other, but only over his own Tenants.</p>
                  <p>If the question be, what Fruit and effect there may be from Regulating Churches in this way? We answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Efficacy of all means, lies in the Blessing of Christ. Now there being two ways of Church proceedings, one by way of communion of Churches, and the Law of Nature, the other by Institution: there is to either, in their kind, a promise of Christ. The Admonition of one Saint to another, though not in Church-fellowship, as it proceedeth by vertue of the communion that is among Saints, and as a Duty of one Saint to another; so it hath a promise of Blessing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable. The Exhortation of one Saint to another, hath a Blessing often to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, though Preaching by Officers be the only instituted means; and so is it here. Therefore such proceedings, by way of Admonition and by way of Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communion, have the promise of the Blessing of Christ as well as that of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in a particular Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a Moral way there is a great deal of Efficacy in these means, to work upon Men. 1. A convincing of a Church offending of their Sin, and of the Error of their way. 2. There is a Testimony given against them. 3. There is a shaming of them, for the design of such withdrawing is (as the Apostle saith, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 14.) that they may be ashamed: There is 4. A Depriving them of the Priviledges of communion with all other Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In an External way, this is like to work as much as Excommunication it self, especially, being back'd by the civil Magistrate, as Excommunication useth to be.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is more suitable for Churches to deal with another Church, or with Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, with Provinces, with Churches in this way, than to assume a power of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them up to Satan.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that Excommunication being the Highest Supream Means, if this means should not be used, there is the most Efficacious means wanting: I answer, that God doth not always Establish that means that is most Efficacious for one sort or kind of Persons, or in all cases that he doth in some, and unto some. Neither is it necessary therefore, that what is in it self to be supposed the most Efficacious means should be applied to Churches, from a greater number of Churches, as the Argument would hold forth. For according to this Reason, God should have appointed Apostles always infallibly to have Governed Churches; because that was the most Efficacious means, and was once extant in the World. And it may as well be said and objected, as it is by the Papists, that unless there be an Apostolical Seat assisted with Infallibility, there is not an Efficacious Remedy for all controversies; and that God hath not provided for his Church, in our Age, as he did for his Church in the first Age. But it suited his Wisdom to leave the Churches in after Ages to have Recourse, in respect of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to a means less Efficacious. The like he did with the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom he stirred up Prophets in all Ages, till after the Captivity, but then left them to the ordinary guidance.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Reasons why God and Christ would have a Church, as the Seat of Divine Worship, wherein they might be Adored and Praised. What a Church is. That Saints or Persons Regenerated and Holy are the proper matter of it. The Church is either the Universal Mystical Church, or a particular Congregation. The grounds of this Distinction shewed from Scripture.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is the practice of all Societies and Corporations, at first embodying themselves to read over their Charter. Thus at the Assizes the Commission is first Read, and in Parliaments, the Writ, by which they are Summoned, is opened.</p>
                  <p>It is then requisite, when any number of Saints do, by mutual consent, joyn into so Holy a Fellowship as a Church is; to shew what Charter and Commission they have for it from Jesus Christ. The question otherwise may be put to us (which was put to Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 23▪) <hi>By what Authority we do these things?</hi> Which Authority, if we are not able to produce, we incur that <hi>premunire, Acts</hi> 19. 40. <hi>We are in danger to be questioned</hi> by God, by Men, <hi>If there be no cause whereby we may give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this meeting.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whence, the name of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is given to such a Fellowship of Saints.</p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:154381:124"/>
                  <p> All inferior civil Societies do embody themselves by a liberty granted and derived from the Head of the Common-wealth they live in; especially when they take on them to exercise any judicial Acts. Therefore this Holy Divine Fellowship, must much more be Authorized by Christ the Head of the Church Universal, since those joyned in it, take upon them the Authority to Judge them within it, as occasion is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. As all meetings in civil Affairs are said to be in the King's Name, so we must prove this to be in Christ's Name: and for this we have that known place, Matth. 18. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together in my Name,</hi> &amp;c. Where he spaaks not of every Assembly of Saints; but of such an Assembly as doth make and constitute a Church; for <hi>(ver.</hi> 17.) those two or three to whom this promise is made are call'd the Church. And by <hi>Name</hi> is, among other things, chiefly meant the Power and Authority of Christ; and is usually so taken in Scripture. So <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 7. The <hi>Pharisees</hi> take it, asking the Apostles, <hi>by what Name or Power have you done this?</hi> And in that Sense the Apostles make answer, ver. 10. <hi>Know that, by the Name of Christ, this Man stands whole before you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there is and ought to be a Church is the confession of all the Professors of the Name of Christ: Papists and Protestants agree in this Assertion, it being a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the Gospel, universally asserted to by all, to whom the sound of the Gospel is come: As, <hi>that there is a God,</hi> is owned by all to whom the sound or preaching of the Works of God is come. As that Notion of a God was preserved in the ruines of the fall; so the Notion that there is a Church hath been preserved, notwithstanding the Apostacy and falling away of Nations to Antichrist, and accordingly hath been Transmitted to us. And as that Notion, that there is a God, was the occasion of an Idolatry and false Worship through Darkness; and of Worshipping a false God, not knowing the true: So this Notion, that there is a Church on Earth, hath, through the like Darkness been the main occasion of all Errors about Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Men not discerning what was the Church which Christ intended.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, that God should have a Church, is exceeding natural and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Divine Nature in God desires it, as it desires communication of it self to the Creatures, that they might glorifie him, so it design'd a communication of it self to many, and to many together united, mutually to praise him. The God-head it self is naturally communicated to three Persons, who mutually rejoyce each in the other, and together in the Union and Participation of such glorious Attributes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30. There is a blessed Fellowship between those three Persons; and God would also have Creatures taken up into the same Fellowship; not only each a-part with himself; but mutually together to glorifie him, which is the nature of a Church. Those three Persons that were three in one, would have a Church of Creatures also; and resolv'd, <hi>that many should become one, as they are one, John</hi> 17. 21. 23. The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is called <hi>the Fellowship of the Mystery, Ephes.</hi> 3. 9. Wisdom also loves to open and cry her precious Wares in places of concourse, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 22. <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 9, 10. Christ who was this Wisdom of his Father says, he had declared his Faithfulness not to his Brethren only apart, but together in the great Congregation, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 35. 18.) Because thereby Glory and Praises, being joynt and mutual, are so much the more encreased; for Glory manifested Results out of the Apprehensions and <hi>Encomiums</hi> of many joyned: Therefore God, e're he would so fully communicate himself, desires a meeting, and an Assembly of the People. So Exod. 25. 8. <hi>Let them make me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them;</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. 42, 43, 44. <hi>There I will meet with you,</hi> that is, when they are all met there. And therefore it is called, in the Original, the Meeting-place; so that if there be a God, he will have a Church to Worship and praise him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jesus Christ desires it also, who was to be made glorious; and therefore was to have a Church, that is, many united in one, whereof he might be the Head: So <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 22. God gave him to be Head to the Church. It was a priviledge to him to have a Church, she is therefore given him; and as this was his desire too, his Father in answer bestows her on him, <hi>Ask and I will give thee, Psal.</hi> 2. 8. As he was to be a Head, so to have a Body; in whom, as in a Head, they might be gathered together in one, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. He was to have many Brethren; and his desire was, that they might be gathered together about him. Thus he declares, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 22. and thus he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to them when assembled on Earth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. and thus he Prays, John 17. 24.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:154381:125"/>
                     <hi>That he and they may be together.</hi> So as if there be a Christ, there is to be a Church also.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Divine nature in us, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.) breath's after such a Fellowship. As Reason and Understanding desires communion with Men, since Man is by Nature (as he that had but Nature said) <hi>Animal</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>sociable, a sociable Creature,</hi> so a Saint is too. As it was not good for <hi>Adam,</hi> the New Creature of the First World, to be alone; so nor for the New Creature of Christ's World. It was <hi>that one thing</hi> of <hi>Davids</hi> Desires, that is, the Top the chief of them, Psal. 27. 4. <hi>One thing have I desired. to dwell in the House of the Lord.</hi> The Church, as they have a Relation to Christ, so likewise one to another; for they are not an <hi>Holy Seed</hi> only, but an <hi>Holy Nation,</hi> a <hi>Royal Kindred:</hi> Who, out of an instinct, desire Fellowship one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>They are taught of God,</hi> (says the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 9.) And therefore as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural instincts shew themselves in Creatures, who, when new fall'n from the Dam, gather in a company about it; so a Spiritual instinct shews it self in those, who, being new Born, associate together. So in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Paul</hi> gives thanks <hi>for their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Gospel from the first Day;</hi> as if, when they were not an Hours standing, they desire it. And therefore in the <hi>Acts,</hi> to be converted to the Church and to the Lord are used promiscuously; they breathing after a Church-Fellowship with the Saints as well as with God.</p>
                  <p>But our Business further, is to enquire what manner of Church it is, which Christ would have erected; and unto which his promise is made that he will be in the midst of them.</p>
                  <p>We shall come the better to know what this Church in particular is to be, if we enquire what the Church in general is?</p>
                  <p>A Church in general is an Assembly of Saints, of Believers, of Men called.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a Company or Assembly united. If there had been but one Angel, or one Man saved, he had not made a Church. 'Tis a Body that hath many Members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. <hi>We being many, are one Body.</hi> 'Tis a Nation, 1 Pet. 2. 9. <hi>A Flock,</hi> an Houshold, a Kingdom, a Common wealth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. The same Men, that considered a-part are call'd Saints, collectively taken, are called the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Church is a company united in one, for without Union, they are not a Church, but a confused Multitude; Therefore it is called one Body, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 4. as there is one God, and one Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12, 13. And <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. it is said to be knit together.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Church is a company of Saints united in one. It is a Society of Believers who are called, as 'tis a Nation for Multitude and Order, so 'tis a Holy Nation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. as it is an Houshold, so of Faith. As it is a Common-wealth, so of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Ephes.</hi> 2. 12. As it is a Temple, so an Holy Temple, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>Holiness</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thine House, <hi>Psal.</hi> 93. 5. It is a Congregation, but of Saints, Psal. 89. 5. 1 Cor. 1. 2. <hi>To the Church of God at</hi> Corinth; <hi>to them that are Sanctified in Christ Jesus, and called to be Saints,</hi> not by Invitation only, as if all to whom ever the Gospel is Preached, might have that name; for so the <hi>West-Indians,</hi> if but Preach'd unto, should be called. But they are called Saints by qualification, that is, they are Sanctified. <hi>They that were not my People</hi> shall be called my People, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 25. (called Saints) that is, that are Saints; for God calls things as they are. <hi>They are called with an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Calling,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. To all callings a qualification is required. If a Man is to be of the Privy-Counsel, the place requires that he should be Wise: If he is to be of a Company to Trade, it is requisite that he be brought up to it: If he is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that he be Gifted; and so, if he be of a Church, that he be Holy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a company joyned to have Fellowship with Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. It is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therefore Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. and <hi>Complementum Christi,</hi> the fullness of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom is Spiritual, so are the Subjects; for Christ is, in Relation to his Church, a King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. To be in a Church is to be fellow Citizens with Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. and with Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. And as Reason only fits us to have Fellowship with Men; so Grace only qualifies us to have communion with Saints and Christ. A Fellowship is of those who are alike in Nature and Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus God would not have <hi>Adam</hi> joyned in Fellowship with Beasts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:154381:125"/> made a Woman for him, as a meet companion, much less will God admit his Second <hi>Adam</hi> Christ, and his Members to be joyned with Swine. <hi>What Fellowship is there between Righteousness and Ʋnrighteousness,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16, 17. They are a Temple to God, and the Stones which frame it are Hewn, before they are laid in the material Building, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17, 18. and therefore they are to be lively Stones, not Dead, as <hi>Peter</hi> alludes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. They are a Body, and the Body of Christ, and therefore the Members are to be simular to the Head. Hence hath arisen that distinction of a Church Mystical, and of a Church Instituted, which suppose the same matter, the same Men, and which are but several Adjuncts of the same matter or relations, whereof the one may be Superadded to the other. As in <hi>Holland,</hi> the same Man that is a Member of the Society of the States General is also, and may be also, of the States of a particular Town; but yet still he must be a Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: Or as in <hi>London,</hi> every Man of a particular Company, may also be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Common-Council of the whole City, but yet he must be a Londoner, and free of the City. So here in this case, if a Person is a Member of the Church Mystical, or of an Instituted Church, he ought to be a Saint. As a Church in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is a Company and Assembly of Saints united; so the Church Mystical is the general Assembly of all Saints on Earth united in Christ to him, and one to another: And the <hi>Church Instituted is,</hi> a particular Assembly of Saints on Earth, united in Christ by a special Covenant. The Members of both the one and the other, are to be Saints united into a Company and Assembly, that so there may be a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I will show the ground for this Distinction of Church, in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There one Church is called <hi>The General Assembly, and the Church of the first Born, Heb.</hi> 12. 23. An Assembly it is, and a General Assembly: And that part of the distinction argues, there is another to be found from which, by that word, it is Distinguisht. And therefore, there are particular Assemblies, which also must be called a Church. Members of this General Assembly, these <hi>Hebrews</hi> were; for he saith, ver. 22. <hi>Ye are come to this General Assembly</hi> as being made a part of it: And that these <hi>Hebrews</hi> were also Members of particular Assemblies, though Dispersed through all Countries, and that they had a Relation unto them, is expresly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Heb. 10. 3. 25. <hi>Not forsaking the Assembling of our selves together.</hi> And they were so to Assemble, as in a special Relation joyned to consider and exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Yea, more expresly we find this mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. where having Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed of the whole Body in the former verses, he (in <hi>ver.</hi> 27.) draws down all he had said in the General of the whole Church, to that particular Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to whom he Writes, chap. 1. 2. <hi>Now ye are the Body of Christ</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>and Members in particular:</hi> Where the Phrase <hi>in particular,</hi> hath Reference both to <hi>Body,</hi> as well as to <hi>Members.</hi> So as the meaning is this, that they in particular, made a Body of Christ; and were Members one of another, also in particular. And therefore all that he had Discoursed of the Nature of the Body, and the Members, and the Offices, and Duties in General, he brings home as particularly true of them, as making a special Body a-part, so the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. They were a Body a-part in Relation to other Churches, and more particularly Members one of another, and that in such a particular manner, as they were not so of any Church else. The like we have as express, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. Where having Discoursed of the Body Mystical, as made up both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as appears by <hi>ve.</hi> 16. he shews <hi>(ver.</hi> 19.) their Relation thereunto. <hi>Ye are no more Strangers, but fellow Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houshold of God,</hi> (namely, that great Houshold of Heaven and Earth, as he calls it, (chap. 15. <hi>and are Built,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 20. <hi>With all Saints into an Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And then he further adds, ver. 22. <hi>and you also are Builded together for an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of God, through the Spirit.</hi> Where 1. He means some one more special fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Temple, then to be Members of the Mystical general Building: For he had said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. Ye are Built up with the whole Church into such a Temple, and it needed not so Emphatically be Repeated again. But in that he says, <hi>you also</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he affirms some further thing of them, then what he had said of them before. He means something more than that, whereas the whole Body is built into a Temple, they are built with them, as a part of that Temple: For that he had said afore <hi>(ver.</hi> 19.) they being part of that whole Temple, of which he says, all is built, <hi>&amp;c. ver.</hi>
                     <pb n="246" facs="tcp:154381:126"/> 20. 2. he makes them a distinct Temple from the former, and plainly intends, that as with the whole they grew up into a Temple: So they in particular, were built up as an Habitation, besides the other. You <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and you as together considered (says he) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>are built up together.</hi> So as he speaks it not of that Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Relation and Conjunction, which they had with all the rest of the Saints in the World, and which every one had privately and personally to the Mystical Church (for that was as common to the <hi>Galatians</hi> as to them) but he means that which they had together in a more peculiar manner, in joynt Relation each to other. If he had designed only their common Relation, he would rather have said, <hi>you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all Saints, are thus built up,</hi> but this he had said afore; but now (says he) <hi>You</hi> Ephesians <hi>together one with another, are built up into a more special House,</hi> or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Oratory (as I may allude to private Chappels in great Cathedrals) or little Sanctuary (as the Prophet speaks, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11. 16.) private by themselves. I might prove the same out of <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. where having first at large Discoursed of the whole Body on Earth <hi>(ver.</hi> 12.) he then passeth <hi>(ver.</hi> 16.) to the use, and end, and benefit of a particular Congregation, which he also calls a whole Body fitly joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so as to supply Nourishment, and to edifie each other. Which of all the Saints on Earth, making up a Mystical Body, cannot be said; for how is every one so Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed able to edifie each other in love?</p>
                  <p>And because there is the same Reason every way of the Body Mystical, and of the Body Instituted; therefore the same priviledges every way, which appertain to the whole Body Mystical, do belong also as fully to every such particular Church, so as indeed they are one, that is, there is <hi>unica &amp; eadem ratio, one and the same conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of the one and the other, as there is the same Nature of a drop that is of the Ocean, since both are Wrater, the one as well as the other. Therefore the Apostles do so promiscuously speak the same things of the one and the other; and in their Discourses, pass without much Distinction from the one to the other. As he that reads an Anatomy of the Body of Man in general, may be said to read it of every Man in particular: So what is said of the invisible Church may be said and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the visible. As the one is called the Body of Christ, so is the other. Yea, as the one is called the whole Body of Christ, so is the other. So of the Church of the <hi>Corinths</hi> he says, when the whole Church is come together in one place. For the Church of Christ is <hi>totum homogeneum, an Homogeneal whole,</hi> whose parts are of the same Nature with it self; and so what is said of the whole, is said of every part.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>The Reasons why Christ hath Instituted a Congregational Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I will now give Reasons, why Christ did Institute such a particular Ordinance, as a particular Congregation of Members joyned, to grow up to be a Body, a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple apart unto Christ, and why he hath thus endowed them with the priviledges, Name and Nature of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there should be joynt and publick profession of the Name of God; and that God should be Worshipped of his Creatures, as Assembled together, is exceeding necessary, and indeed natural. Though the manner of Divine Worship is Instituted, yet that God should be Worshipped by many (when many are extant, that may Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him) is as natural, as that he is to be Worshipped. Therefore all Nations have ever had publick Assembly's, in which to Worship their God's. And therefore in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi> no sooner did that common Work of Mankind spread into Branches; but it is upon the Genealogy presently Recorded, and put unto it, as the consequence of it, Gen. 4. 26. <hi>Then began Men to call upon the Name of the Lord,</hi> that is publickly and together; for privately, they had done it afore: Or if it be meant of Idolatrous Worship (as some interpret it) that the Men began prophanely to call on the Name of the Lord; yet publick it was. And however that they thus fall upon it, argues the voice of Nature as it is, <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 5. and is argued from it. The People of God argue from it, to provoke one another to publick Worship, of which he there speaks,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:154381:126"/> (ver. 1, 2.) <hi>How in latter Days,</hi> that is, under the Gospel, <hi>there should be flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Mountain of the Lord, and all People should flow to it. And many Nations shall say, come, let us go up and Assemble,</hi> &amp;c He speaks in the Language of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to express the Worship of the New. You know the Temple stood upon a Mountain, to which the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> Resorted for publick Worship, so as to go up to the Mountain of the Lord, is to Assemble together to Worship. And how do they provoke one another to this? By the Law of Nature Written in all Men's Hearts, ver. 5. <hi>For all People will walk in the Name of his God;</hi> that is, make a joynt and publick profession of him, and together call upon him: For to that he there exhorts, <hi>v.</hi> 5. It is a Natural instinct in the New Creature, therefore they breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to have Assemblies wherein to Worship God, is natural; so now under the Gospel, particular Assemblies are necessary. When indeed the Church was contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Judea,</hi> so as all the Nation might at once meet; for greater Solemnity, God ordained three Solemn meetings every year; and therefore they were a National Church. But now when the Gospel was Preached all the World over, and Saints were to be gathered from over all the World; it was necessary that Church Assemblies should be Instituted, and set up every where. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> gives Directions for publick Ordinances, that as now they might pray for all Men, which the <hi>Jews</hi> might not do, so that God now would have all Saved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4, 6. And therefore he was the Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> 8. 7. <hi>I will therefore</hi> (it is an inference therefrom) <hi>that Men pray every where,</hi> he speaks of publick Assemblies, and the ordering them, as in the whole Epistle. Therefore <hi>Judea</hi> it self, which was before a Church National, and they were to come to the Temple to Worship, now had many Churches in it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 2. And therefore the Prophets speaking of the latter days, and Prophecying of the Church Assemblies, then call them not an Assembly only (as that of the <hi>Jews</hi> was called the great Congregation) but Assemblies. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 5. He says, <hi>He will create upon every dwelling place of</hi> Mount Sion, <hi>Assemblies,</hi> &amp;c. not <hi>Assembly:</hi> Which yet should be all on <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> and have the same priviledge and promise, that <hi>Mount Sion</hi> had. So we have it expressed in <hi>Malach.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Incense shall be offered up every where;</hi> and so the Temple was to be every where.</p>
                  <p>For 3. It cannot be imagined, that Christ should not be as good to his Church, in respect of Dispensations of Grace under the Gospel, as under the Old Testament. Therefore all the Priviledges that the <hi>Jews</hi> met together in the Temple had, and all the Ordinances wherein they joyntly partook, and the like helps, and more full of Grace in stead of those other, were to Succeed in the New Testament: For his Name, he says, should be as great among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> as ever among the <hi>Jews.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ sets up a Temple, and gives power to his Church in all places to set up Temples and Habitations to himself; and endows all those private Churches, with all the priviledges and endowments that the Assembly of the <hi>Jews</hi> had. And hence now, every such Assembly is called the Lord's Mountain, and his Temple; and hence, all the <hi>Encomiums</hi> mentioned of the <hi>Jews</hi> Church, are now given to two or three poor Assembled. As he said of the Temple, I will put my Name there, <hi>(Deut.</hi> 12. 11. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 29.) so now Christ's word is, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 18. 19, 20.) <hi>I say to you, That where two or three are gathered together, I will be in the midst of them.</hi> Which words as <hi>Cameron</hi> Notes, are not Assertory only; but Institutive. Yea, I say further, look what Priviledges and what Ordinances all Saints on Earth, if Assembled together, should partake of, the same as fully and entirely hath Christ appointed, two or three Assembling in his Name to partake in, till they all meet together in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It was for Christ's Honour, that it should be thus; that such Spiritual Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Common-wealths, and Bodies of Saints, should be erected to shew that Christ is King. For Christ is a King, and must Rule amongst the midst of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. He Reigns over Wicked Men by his Providence; but as he is peculiarly King of Saints, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 3. so in and over his Saints peculiarly, and that not in their Hearts only; but outwardly and visibly in an ordered instituted Kingdom and Body. He is King not only in having Saints, but in having Saints or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and embodied together in Holy Societies, Col. 2. 2. <hi>I rejoyce to behold your Order.</hi> He is a King over the Bodies of his Saints, as well as their Souls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. for he Redeemed both. And therefore as his work is to guide their Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:154381:127"/> by his Spirit; so their outward Man by his Officers and Ordinances appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. An Instituted Church is called his Kingdom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 43. For he says, <hi>That Kingdom</hi> shall be taken away, he means Ordinances, and the Candlestick of the Church. And it is reason, that his Kingly Office should be extended as large as his Prophetical and Priestly. His Prophetical reacheth to outward things, to Baptism, and the Lords Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His Priestly Office was performed externally a-fore the World; and so he was to the <hi>Jews</hi> in outward things, <hi>Jesus Christ the same to day that yesterday, Heb.</hi> 13. 8. The Kingdom then answerably, is visible in an external Administration. Christ was to have an House under the New Testament, as under the Old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 21. We have an High Priest over the House of God, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he urgeth Assembling together, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. which makes Christ an House: Now if we are not to forsake the Assemblies, it is then our Duty to begin to form them, and it is remarkable that he says <hi>Assembling,</hi> not Assemblies only.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. By the Institution of these particular Churches, Christ sets up a Kingdom, and judgeth a-fore-hand. He judgeth them within, by casting them out if Offenders, which shews, that he will not bear with Scandals: And he Judgeth also those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, in denying to admit them, and so separates between the Pretious and the Vile, and makes a day of Judgment aforehand. Therefore we find it made by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Fruit of these Assemblies that Christ Judgeth amongst the Nations, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 3. 4. <hi>Michah</hi> 5. 2. 3. And another Fruit is that they are Blessed, as means to convert Souls, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Saints have as much need now of Assembling thus, as then. <hi>Adam</hi> had need of Fellowship in Innocency, and much more do we need it in a State of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore the Apostle exhorts upon that ground to these Assemblies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Comparison between the Church Mystical, Universal, and an Instituted par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church. Wherein they both agree, and in what Respects there is a difference between the one and the other. The Definition of a Congregational Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>SInce there is like Reason for the Universal Mystical Church, and particular Churches; and since every particular Church hath the Resemblance, Name, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and Attributes of the general, and all that it hath, is Modificated by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Institution: Let us therefore compare a little the one with the other, by which we shall the more clearly see the true Notion and Nature of an Instituted Church, by seeing both what is common to both, and wherein the one is Modificated, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the other.</p>
                  <p>A Church Instituted, is a company as well as the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17. for the Ordinances of it are a communion, ver. 16. <hi>And we being many, are one Body, and partakers of that</hi> one Bread, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. There is only this difference, that an Instituted Church is but of as many as come together in one place, 1 Cor. 14. 23. <hi>When the whole Church is come together in one place;</hi> mark that, he calls that the whole Church, which yet was but those Saints at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. When you come together in one, not with one mind only, but in one place: But that other Mystical Church, is the company of Saints all the World over. And the Reason why God did contract this Instituted Church to such a number, as could meet in one place, was because the end of that Institution and Meeting, was full communion and entire, such as that they who meet, should partake in all Ordinances together with one accord, as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46. And then Nature doth teach, that it can be but such a company, and so many as can all hear and edifie one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and who may from the same Pastor, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Holy Ghost, and the same provocation of Grace at the same time; and who may <hi>Glorifie God with one Mouth, and one Mind,</hi> Rom. 15. 6. <hi>and serve him with one shoulder, Zach.</hi> 3. 6. And therefore in that Institution of a Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions their agreement. 'Tis agreement as met together, which is essential to every
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:154381:127"/> Ordinance. <hi>If two shall agree,</hi> our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19. The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is make up a Consort, an Harmony; for Ordinances and Prayer are so to God, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 19. And therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. Though he says, many made that one Body at <hi>Corinth;</hi> yet they were but so many, as could be partakers of that one Bread, and receive the Sacrament together, and as many as might all learn, when they Prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one by one, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 31. And so at <hi>Ephesus, (Acts</hi> 20. 28.) The Elders were to take care of all the Flock, therefore such a Flock is to be no more, then such as Pastors can take the care of. And therefore in those Countries and Regions, where the Saints did Multiply, their Churches were Multiplied also, as in <hi>Galatia,</hi> there were the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 1. and so in <hi>Asia</hi> too, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 4. 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 41. But the Mystical Church, is the Assembly of all Saints, it is <hi>the whole Family both in Heaven and Earth, Ephes.</hi> 3. 15. which, like the Sea, is too vast in this World, to be gathered into one place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the Church Mystical is a company of Saints; so is the Church Instituted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be. So was the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 2. <hi>To the Church at</hi> Corinth, <hi>called to be Saints.</hi> And it is a company of such as are Elect: So 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 5. 13. The Church which was at <hi>Babilon,</hi> is said <hi>to be Elect together with them,</hi> that particular Church was such. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> Testifies of that Instituted Church at <hi>Philippi, Phil.</hi> 1. 1. calling them the Saints there, with the Bishops and Deacons, and in as much as he mentions Officers, he speaks of them as of an Instituted Church. And this he says, not speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the better part, as giving the Denomination to the whole; but as of every one amongst them, ver. 6. <hi>being confident in this, that you have a good Work in you.</hi> And he expresseth that it was meet to think so of them all, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, else they all had not been meet, to have been of the Church. The like is spoken of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 2. and 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 5. And there is a World of Reason for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For to all callings there is to be a Qualification.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because these are to make up a Body to Christ, as well as the Mystical; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must be answerable to their Head. It would be very unsuitable, <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano capiti cervicem jungere equinam, To joyn Monstrous Members to such a Glorious Head.</hi> They who are joyned to Christ, must not be Members of an Harlot.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. These are called to Fellowship with Christ and his Saints. And as Moral vertues fit Persons to have communion with Men, so Grace only qualifies Men to have communion with Christ and Saints.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Their Fellowship, and Meetings, and Transactions, are to be with one accord, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32. and with one Heart. Now Faith will give them that. The Believers met with one mind, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 32. And they only can and will do so. There is to be an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an Harmony, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in a Church, and one false string makes a Discord. There must be agreeing in Principles to fit Men for Church-Fellowship, and as Men that agree in the Fundamental Laws of a Kingdom, are only fit to be Subjects in that Kingdom: So those only are fit to be Subjects of this Spiritual Kingdom, that agree in acknowledgment of the Fundamental Principles of Godliness; which only true Faith will enable a Man to do, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Philemon</hi> 6. Therefore those, who deny the power of Godliness, are not to be received; but we are to turn away from them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. Nay, such a mixture will cause apparent variance, so Christ says, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 34, 35. For such Persons are contrary, and led by contrary Principles; and how then can they be joyned in such a Fellowship, as is the most near communion with Christ.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ends of Church-Fellowship, are the Form of it (as I shall shew anon) Now therefore such matter is only to be taken in, as may comply and be Serviceable to those ends. Christ, when he makes any Institution to an end, makes it such as may attain that end; or else it is in vain, and so not an Ordinance. Now wicked Men are no more fit matter, nor no more capable of the Spiritual ends of a Congregation, than the body of a Beast is fit for a reasonable Soul to dwell in and enform, and to use to actions reasonable. For the ends of this Body of a Church, and of this Holy Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and of every Member of it, is to edifie one another, and every part is to supply Grace to it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. And for that Men must have received the Spirit, and some Spiritual Gift. Therefore those who have not the Spirit of Christ, and have no Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts and Graces, have but the Spirit of this World, and are unfit, and will be so far from edifying the Church, that (as <hi>Solomon</hi> says <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9: 18.) <hi>One Sinner will destroy much good.</hi> And are such Persons also fit to Reprove, to Judge, and thereby
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:154381:128"/> to preserve the Church pure? Since they are such whom Christ calls Swine; they are so unfit to Reprove, as they are not fit to be Reproved; <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. And it is of such the Apostle also speaks, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.) That they cannot receive things Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; but they are foolishness unto them, and therefore they are unfit to Judge those within, for the Spiritual Man only Judgeth all things, and is Judged of none, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. How many Men are of <hi>Gallio's</hi> Temper, if it be a matter of right or wrong, that is to be Judged of in the Common-wealth, they can do it: But if the matter is about the Spiritualness of the Law or Gospel (which things are within the proper cognizance of this Church Court) they care for no such matter; or if they Judge, they will certainly cast out their Brethren, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 5: And say God be glorified when they have done.</p>
                  <p>So then as well an Instituted Church, as the Mystical is to consist only of Saints, and Saints are to be the matter of both; only <hi>de facto,</hi> indeed there sometimes falls out this difference.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Mystical Church being immediately called by God, consists of those only, whom, as the Apostle says, <hi>The Lord approves and Judgeth such,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 18.) without the Judgment of Men coming between, who are <hi>Jews</hi> inwardly; and whose Religion is that of the Heart, and whose praise is not of Men, but of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29. But this Instituted Church, though immediately ordained to be of God, and according to his Laws; yet the gathering of it, and assembling of it, is an Act of Man's (namely of Saints) and therefore <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. It is called <hi>the Assembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves together.</hi> And such is the calling and apointing of Ministers; whose calling, though it be of God's Institution; yet the Designment, who should be a Minister, is immediately by Men. And therefore so the Apostle Distinguisheth his immediate call from that of other Ministers, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 1. 1.) That it was not by Men, but by Christ: Hence therefore because what Persons should be of this or that Congregation is Determined by the Judgment of a company of Men that are Spiritual, whom in these things God hath left Supream Judges on Earth, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>The Spiritual Man Judgeth</hi> all things, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> And because they in Judging are, and may be often deceived; hence <hi>de facto</hi> it comes to pass, that in great Congregations there may be some found that prove Hypocrites. Thus the Apostles tells them, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 30. that in <hi>Ephesus, Men of themselves should arise Teaching</hi> perverse things, though, in the institution and choice of Members, never so great care was had. But still though these Saints may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the application of the Rule; yet they are to hold fast the Rule it self, that Saints only are fit matter for a Church, and that such only are to be admitted (tho' they who have the power of receiving them are often mistaken. Yea, though Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Believers may be found in the Church, without a Wedding-Garment; yet to them in the Church they are as Saints, and justified as such, being not known to be otherwise. So as though before God, and as to his Knowledge, others than Saints may be in a Church, yet none but such as are to us, and in our Judgments, Saints and Holy, and of whom (as the Apostle says, 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6, 7.) it is meet for us to think they have a work wrought, knowing their Election, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5. are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by us into Church-Fellowship. By us there are none to be admitted, but such as to us are Saints. So then to us, a Church Instituted is all Holy, and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and Elected, and Sanctified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And hence also, this further difference between the matter of the one and the other ariseth; that those who are Saints invisible to Men, or inwardly such; and who yet are visibly such to God's Eye, are the matter of the Mystical Church: But such as are visible Saints to Men, not to wicked Men; (for they are blind, and Judge not of Colours) but visible to them who are appointed Judges, which are the Saints; who as they only have a Right to Ordinances, so to Judge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. So that as <hi>True Faith</hi> before God, is the Form of the Members of the invisible Church, so a true profession of Faith outwardly, is essential to make fit matter capable of being Framed into an Instituted Church. And as that is ordained to be an External Visible Body, so a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble True Faith is necessary in the Members of it; and therefore it is called the Houshold of Faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 23. Now it is not he that saith he hath Faith <hi>(James</hi> 2. 14.) in a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal profession that is outwardly a visible Believer; But saith <hi>James; Shew me thy Faith by thy Works, ver.</hi> 18. Faith is called therefore, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13.) a professed Subjection to the Gospel; but it must be a Faith that is effectual to the acknewledging of such Truths, as are after Godliness <hi>(Tit.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Philemon</hi> 6.) and so effectual, as to prevail
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:154381:128"/> in others that are Saints, to acknowledge every good thing in them, <hi>(Philemon</hi> 6.) and such as it may cause them that are Saints, to think it meet so to judge of them <hi>(Phil.</hi> 1. 6.) and such as hath the obedience of Faith to attend it, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 15.) and such as hath a professed Subjection to the Gospel in the whole Man; for it is to be such, as is no lye: Now to profess in Words, and deny in Deeds, is the greatest lye that is, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 6. And Lyars are to be without, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As the Church Mystical is a company knit and united together into one Body to Fellowship with Christ, and one with another by the Spirit: So also is a Church Instituted to be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is to be a company knit and united together; for they, though many, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>One Body</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20. and <hi>Ephes</hi> 4. 16.) <hi>joyned</hi> together and compacted, and <hi>(Ephes.</hi> 2. 22.) they are <hi>Builded</hi> together for an Habitation for God; a Distinct Habitation by themselves (those places speak all of an Instituted Church) yea, and so in particular united, as to make a distinct entire Body unto Christ from all other Churches, as those <hi>Ephesians (Eph.</hi> 2. 22.) did; and the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. Thus the Apostle speaks likewise, Rom. 12. 4. <hi>We being many are one Body in Christ, and every one Members one of another.</hi> And he speaks it in Relation to an Instituted Church, for <hi>(ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8.) he Reckons up the Offices and Organs of such a Body <hi>(He that teacheth on teaching,</hi> &amp;c.) and therefore he intimates them to be in such a particular manner, Members one to another, as to none Else; and to be joyned into such a Body, as that they have power by vertue of such a conjunction, to Judge one another that are within the Body (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12.) and to put out from among them, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Which power they have not over other Saints, or any Saints in the World; but only over such as were by some special means made of them, and of their Body; and therefore distinctly Formed, as into a Distinct Common-wealth. And it is a Body not <hi>Confused,</hi> but <hi>Ordered,</hi> according to several Gifts, to several Functions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. so the Apostle saith of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> that he rejoyced beholding their Order, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5. So he tells the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that they were a Body not only joyned together; but <hi>fitly joyned</hi> together, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to be a company united by the Spirit. So the Church of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> was built together <hi>by the Spirit, into an Habitation, Ephes.</hi> 2. 22. And those other places are to be understood of both, Eph. 4. 4. <hi>There is one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called,</hi> &amp;c. that is, this is exemplified in you, who by one Spirit have been called into one Body, as into an hope of calling, and (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12.) by one Spirit we are all Baptized into one Body, being made all to drink into one Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a company joyn'd to have Fellowship with Christ, such was the Church of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to whom he Writes as to a particular Church (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2.) and who are said <hi>to be called to Fellowship with Christ, ver.</hi> 9. such were the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who were an Instituted Church, <hi>Phil</hi> 1. 1, 2. And they are said <hi>to have Fellowship in the Gospel from the first Day, ver.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>These things are common to both the Church Mystical, and Instituted; but there are these differences between the one and the other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In their knitting together and union, there is a difference. The union of the whole Church Mystical is internal, and simply by the Communication of the Spirit, and by the communion of the same Faith and Love, having the same Spirit in them, that dwells in Christ, and all his Members; and having the same Faith (like preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Faith, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1.) which is called the communion of Faith; and being interested in the same benefits, in the same common Salvation, as <hi>Jude</hi> calls it, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. and in the same common Lord, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 2. with all that in every place call upon the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord. But the union of an Instituted Church (though it contains and supposeth all this in the matter of it) as it is more Special, particular, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, so it is founded upon something more peculiar. And as the Government of it is external, so the union of it is also. As 1. Is seen by gathering together in one place, in the Name of Christ, Acts 2. 44. <hi>All that Believed were together,</hi> and Mat. 18. 20. <hi>Where two or three are gathered together,</hi> &amp;c. When the Law was given, and that Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> was to be Constituted, the People were all Assembled to meet God. Thus it is under the Gospel too, when ye come together, saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. as coming together and cohabitation is necessary to a Marryed condition; so it is to this. Though indeed it do not cease to be a Church if dispersed, or any Member to be a Member, if severed a while; but their union being in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:154381:129"/> to gathering together, it may continue as Man and Wife, may be Man and Wife still,, though for a Season they are asunder, but yet their Relation was ordained to be by coming together, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 5.) And therefore if either voluntarily will depart, the other party is free, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. And because this Church-Relation is Ordained for coming together; therefore if any forsake the Assembling together, it doth unchurch them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25.</p>
                  <p>And whereas their gathering is in the Name of Christ; it is meant to be either in the Authority of Christ, as was said, or further also, for the Name of Christ, for so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is taken. This Christ says, (Matth. 11. 6.) <hi>Blessed is he that is not offended in me, that is, for me.</hi> So we are said to Exalt the Name of Christ in his Ordinances, and every Ordinance is Christ's Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This being gathered in Christ's Name, is the end of this Holy company, which Distinguisheth it from all Societies else; for <hi>Finis in moralibus idem quod forma in naturalibus; the end of Moral things, is the same as the form in Naturals.</hi> As a company of Students meeting together at publick Acts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> makes a Colledge; a company of Men Assembling to consult, are called the Council: So a company of Saints met not to any other purpose, as to eat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for then they make not a Church, 1 Cor. 11. 20, 21, 22. <hi>Have you not Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to eat in,</hi> ctc.) but in the Name of Christ, and to call upon his Name, are a Church for that end put upon the meeting, must go to make a Church.</p>
                  <p>They are to be united together, to a constant gathering together. It is not every suddain meeting that makes a Church, as to Pray, Fast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact together, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. It is an united company of Brethren, <hi>that must dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Ʋnity. Psal.</hi> 113. 1. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> the Type of our Assemblies, was a City com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, <hi>Psal.</hi> 122. 31. The first Church (as 'tis called, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 47.) continued in the Apostles Fellowship, and that stedfast, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42, 46. For otherwise it could not make a distinct Body unto Christ, as the <hi>Ephesians</hi> did, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 22. They were made an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation unto God, alluding to the Temple; which was called the House of God, and was a setled thing. And the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is observable to this purpose (as it is by <hi>Beza)</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

A Church is an abiding place, not a Tent for a Night; and in that he says, they were not only an Habitation, but that they dwell together <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be an Habitation, the Phrase implies constantly. And surely, that which setleth any Common-wealth into a Body, must fix this Sacred company. A company meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at several Fairs or Marts, never make a Body or Corporation, because they are fluid and part again; but constant Assembling and Unity, makes a Society; and in as much as it is a Body compacted to edifie it self, it implies constancy. For if Members should be Disjoynted, and some Members make up the Body the one day, others another, there would be little supply of Nourishment; for the Nourishment is from what every joynt supplies.</p>
                  <p>And therefore to fix them, it is meet and requisite they be joyned by a special co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which may make and express a more special Relation. For indeed, as the Relation which Faith internal works between us and Christ, is the Form of the Church Mystical; so the Special Relation to Christ and to one another, to enjoy all Christ's Ordinances, goes to make up the Form of the Church Instituted. This Relation a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant formally and expresly works; and constant meeting with such an intention, really and virtually makes. And therefore not Saints scattered, though living and meeting in one place, makes a Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 1. <hi>Apollo</hi> is said to find Disciples at <hi>Corinth,</hi> but not a Church.</p>
                  <p>The Tabernacle, the Type of this Gospel-Church was knit together by Taches, <hi>Exod.</hi> 26. 6. which <hi>(Acts</hi> 15. 16.) is made. by <hi>James,</hi> the Type of Building up the Church of Christ for Worship, under the New Testament. And if no mention had been made of any such thing; yet the Nature of the thing implies it: For a Scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed People, that Assemble not out of an obligation, cannot be supposed to have power each over other. Hence also we find in Scripture, that the Apostles Writing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, speak of such as were Members in covenant with them, in a Phrase of propriety and special Relation. So says the Apostle of <hi>Epaphras, Colos.</hi> 4. 2: <hi>Who is one of you,</hi> in Special Relation: And there was a Stipulated Subjection to Christ; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13: as indeed all Societies are knit by outward agreements:</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="253" facs="tcp:154381:129"/> 2. As the Saints are joyned into one Body, so, as occasion is, into a Body ordered, not confused. For God in the Church is not the Author of Confusion but Peace. It is to be a Kingdom, a Common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> a Body Politick, not civily Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, but Spiritually: An Army with Banners, in which are several Stations, Ranks, Laws and Constitutions. Therefore <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 5. he Rejoyceth, as in their <hi>Faith</hi> as Christians, so in their <hi>Order,</hi> by which things were ordered in their Church among them. Which Order may note out.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An Enjoyment of all Ordinances Instituted by Christ, according to Christ's Laws. So when the Apostle had Rectified their Abuses, and brought them to the Primitive true Institution of the (Sacrament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. <hi>That I received of the Lord, I delivered to you)</hi> He calls this a setting things in Order among them, the Rest I will set in Order when I come, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. All which Ordinances when rightly and duly Administred, he calleth, <hi>(ver.</hi> 2.) Traditions or Ordinances, as he delivered them. Whereof the one was the right Administration of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Which I think were called Traditions, not that they were unwritten, as the Papist's assert; but because they were new Institutions, which came in the room of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Ordinances, and Form of Government, and which were meerly Institutions, <hi>de novo,</hi> received from Christ, and delivered only to them, (as <hi>ver.</hi> 25.) implies: And not to be found formerly commanded, in the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Order of a Gospel-Church, imports the Ranking and Ordering all their Members into such proper Offices, according to their Gifts; that all those Ordinances might be enjoyed; and all Gifts among them, to the utmost, be improved to the use of the whole. As therefore it is called a Body, for the Identity of Members in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are made for substance of the same Flesh and Nature, (for all Saints are Flesh of Christ's Flesh, and Bone of his Bone (as we say) of those that are a-like and a Kin) and of the same Graces: So also it is a Body <hi>joyned, (Ephes.</hi> 4. 16.) for Union and Unity; and not only so, but fitly joyned. It is not only rightly joyned, but fitly placed and disposed according to the Gifts of every Member. It is fitly joyned, not for the Ornament and Beauty only of the whole; but for the use and supplying true Nourishment to the whole. Which we shall find to be that which under the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a Body, the Apostle doth much insist on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>In a Body there are not only many Members, as was observed, and so in a Church; But 2. These Members are of several sizes and measures of Gifts and Graces, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. There is a proportion in every part, which according to its measure supplies Nourishment to the whole; which the Apostle calls, (Rom. 12 6.) <hi>the proportion of Faith received by each.</hi> And 3. These Gifts are divers, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4.) there are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Gifts, as are in the Members of the Body. The Hand is gifted and fitted to do something, which the Eye is not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 15. <hi>The Hand is not the Foot,</hi> &amp;c. that is, serves not for that use the Hand doth. Which Diversity of Gifts or fitness for use to the whole, ariseth partly out of the several Institutions and ordering of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. All the Members for Substance, consists of the same Simular parts, Flesh, Blood, Veins, Nerves, Arteries, Bones, which are a-like in the Hand and Foot; but being variously ordered and tempered (as the Apostles word is, <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) in one there being more of Nerves, in an other more of Flesh; in some there being one Grace more eminent as Love, Pity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in others Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> accordingly doth there arise a several Gift out of the various composition and temperament of the same Graces. They also arise from Superadded habits, infused by the Spirit; as in the Primitive Church the extraordinary Gifts wholly did, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. And now these ordinary Gifts (that one should have his understanding furnished more for words of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> to teach Churches; another for words of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> to apply them wisely, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.) are from a several insused Habit, put in by the Spirit over and above their Grace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As their Gifts are divers, so the Offices, and Administrations, and Ordinances in the Church are divers; and the one are suited to the other, there being no Gift, but an Office is appointed to exercise it; and an Ordinance also is Instituted, unto which both these Gifts and Offices serve. This we find in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 4. that all Members as they have not the <hi>same Gifts;</hi> so nor the <hi>same Office,</hi> and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5. that as there are <hi>Diversities of Gifts,</hi> so of <hi>Administrations,</hi> that is, Offices, or Ministries, as the word signifies; to exercise them in. And the Operations of these Ordinances,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:154381:130"/> and Success by those Ordinances, are answerable in the Hearts of the rest. And all these are fitted to all the needs in the Church, <hi>(ver.</hi> 21.) <hi>The Eye cannot say to the Foot, I have no need of you;</hi> not so much as a little finger can be wanting.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. As the whole Church hath need of the right placing and disposing of all these Members to those several Offices, for the enjoying all those Ordinances, so Christ hath appointed it. This is the Order of the whole, and makes it a Body, when the Hand stands not where the Eye should, nor the Foot where the Hand should, which disposure the Apostle <hi>(ver.</hi> 24.) called setting divers Officers in the Church, or fitly ordering them. And therefore to this Day, the putting or ordaining of any to the Ministry, is called giving and taking Orders.</p>
                  <p>In this doth this Instituted Body differ from that Mystical; that though, when all the scattered Members of that Mystical Body, shall come all together at latter day, there will be a differing measure of Grace and Glory (which <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 14. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle calls the measure of the Stature of every Member) which, put together, makes up Christ's fullness, and each Person a perfect Man in his Body Mystical, all having their several, yet full Stature: Yet then because there shall be a perfect Unity in Faith and Knowledge, as there shall be no need of Ordinances (God being all in all, and the Lamb the light of them, and so no Temple there, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 23.) so nor of variety of Gifts and Offices, which in this Instituted Body are found, <hi>Till we all</hi> come to the Unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no longer, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>We may then take this for a sure Rule, in Reading the Epistles of the Apostles, that where we find the Body of Christ with Members, and varieties of Gifts and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and Executions of Offices spoken of; there this Instituted Body of Christ is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and principally meant.</p>
                  <p>The Church Mystical, and the particular Churches Instituted agree in this, that both of them are ordained, that in them we might have a Fellowship with Christ, and one with another, so <hi>(Phil.</hi> 1. 5.) It is called <hi>Fellowship in the Gospel.</hi> And in the Instituted Church, there are the same Ordinances that are in the Mystical, only there are some Ordinances in this, that are not in the other; so as it differs from it in some ways and means of Fellowship. In the Mystical Church, the Members have Fellowship with Christ, by Duties of the first command, especially private Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in an Instituted Church, they have communion with him by Duties of the second command: That as the Church it self is an Ordinance, so the means of Fellowship in it, are Ordinances external also. Christ here communicates himself by publick Gifts and Dispensations, by the Offices of Teachers, Pastors, Elders; and by Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by Excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so by these ways too, the Members have Fellowship one with another. By Ordinances of the Mystical Church, as the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have common Faith; so in immediate fruits of it, they have and may have a communion; as to love: and shew effects of it by Relieving, Reproving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For if there be a communion of their Persons, then also of their Graces, <hi>Philemon</hi> 6. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 1. 4. If they have a communion, as of one Christian Friend with another, then in Offices of Friendship too. Thus having the same Spirit of Faith, they may build one another in Faith by Speech, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 10. <hi>I Believed, therefore speak.</hi> They have the same Spirit of Prayer, and therefore may Pray in the Holy Ghost, may say our Father, and so likewise out of Love, may Relieve one another. But in a Church In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, there is this difference.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Tho' that these things are all taken in; yet they are made constant Set Duties, not to be omitted. To others they are but occasional, tho' by a special obligation, thus they are bound to do good to all, but especially to the Houshold of Faith; and so to love all, and to pray for all Saints as occasion is; but these joyned in Church-fellowship are especially, Setly, and <hi>ex Officio, by Office</hi> engaged in these Duties: As to talk Holily every Day, but setly on the Sabbath Day. Therefore Exhortation to these common Duties, comes in after a Church supposed to be Instituted so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23, 24, 25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These common Duties are taken in here as Ordinances, and so have a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Relation put upon them; so as they have the Nature of an Ordinance. Thus <hi>(Matth.</hi> 18. 15.) Private Admonition is made an Ordinance; and therefore comes in after and upon the Institution of such a Church-fellowship, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23, 24, 25.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:154381:130"/> 3. In a Church Instituted there are Ordinances, in which the Mystical Church out of such a State, cannot at all partake. There is the Sacrament, which is a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion of many made one Body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. and there is Excommunication; which supposeth a Body; and a Fellowship engaging each other, and having power to Judge them within it self. Thus likewise there are Offices in an Instituted Congregational Church, which are not in the Universal Mystical Church. The <hi>Jews</hi> had publick Feasts and Ordinances, not to be used out of the Holy Mountain, and a great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, <hi>(Lev.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 5, 6. and <hi>ver.</hi> 14.) which was not to meet out of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 26, 27. And this was a Type of Gospel-Assemblies; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 2, 3, 4. As private performances are not accepted, until a Man is a Member of the Mystical Body; so nor these, till a Man is joyned in the Instituted Body. As Ministers are set in the Church, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28.) so are these Ordinances too.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In an Instituted Congregational Church, there is a further Blessing on all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. We Pray in private, but in the Temple more acceptably, we Reprove a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in a Church way more acceptably. There may be a Preaching out of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but in the Church 'tis in Season, as Sermons, on Week-days, bless; but on the Sabbath, give a special Blessing Redoubled from the consideration of the Day, and of the Duty, so it is here in this case, Psal. 133. 3. <hi>The Lord hath commanded a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, one end of a Church is, that a Man therein may enjoy further fellowship and more ways of communion than out of it. There is a threefold Fellowship.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Personal in Secret Duties; so <hi>John,</hi> in <hi>Pathmos,</hi> had Fellowship with Father, Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1: 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a Mystical Fellowship common to all Saints.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a communion of Saints in an Instituted Church, which takes in all that is in the other, and some things besides. This was Typified ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had private communion in their Synagogues, as they had a publick communion in their National Worship.</p>
                  <p>Another end of communion of Saints, in a particular Church, is to edifie one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Faith and Love, which is the end of all Gifts, Ordinances, and of the Institution of a Church it self, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16. and <hi>Colos.</hi> 2. 19. The whole Body being thus fitly knit by what every Joynt, and Calling, and Member, supplies in every part, doth the whole in every part encrease to the edifying of it self in Love. For this end also, the several Gifts and Offices do serve, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Pastors, Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the edifying of the Body of Christ. It is not only <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we Translate perfecting, but it may signifie the joynting in of Members, so as it includes conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the bringing Men into the Body, which are scattered from it; and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafting and joynting them into the Body of Christ, and the excellency of Gifts is to be measured by it, 1 Cor. 14. 12. <hi>But also for edifying the Saints.</hi> Now to have the Church edified, is as much, and of as much moment and necessity, as to have the Saints converted at first: For there is a fullness of Stature appointed, and every Member must grow up unto it, before it goes to Heaven; for when all meet, every Member must have a due proportion in the whole. And therefore Christ says, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 18. 3.) <hi>Except ye be converted, i. e.</hi> Except ye be further converted; ye Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples already converted, ye cannot be Saved. Now for this edifying every part, doth this Ordinance of a Church, and of the Offices in it serve. And the Reason why among us, the Ministry serves to conversion more then building up; and the Gifts are more to work on Wicked Men, than to build up Godly Men, is that we want this Ordinance of a Right constitution of Churches, and of the Ordinances and Officers thereof. Whereas yet it is of as much consequence as the other. For as by conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Church is encreased <hi>Extensively</hi> in Persons, so, in the other, <hi>Intensively in</hi> Graces: And to this end should all exercises, in Church Assemblies, and other meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of particular Members of it in private tend, 1 Cor. 14. 26. <hi>Let all things be done to edification,</hi> ver. 31. <hi>That all may learn and all may be comforted.</hi> And so in private meetings of the same Body, they should provoke to love and good Works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24. and to have the Church edified.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude this, thus hath God ordained, that till the whole Body meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with every Member grown up to its full Stature (when they shall grow no more, and need no more edifying, being come to its full growth) these particular Bodies should serve to encrease them, and to fit them for that General Assembly
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:154381:131"/> against the time that they then meet; when this imperfect Church, and all the Gifts and Ordinances of it, shall be swallowed up in that General Church, as Rivers are when they fall into the Sea; and then all this, which is imperfect, shall be done away.</p>
                  <p>This communion of Saints in a particular Church, is further designed to the glory of God through Christ, which is the end of all: So gathering together in his Name, may be understood. Which may mean <hi>for his Name</hi> (as was observed) so 2 Cor. 20. 8. <hi>Thou hast Built a Sanctuary for thy Name.</hi> He would put his Name there; and his Name was Great, <hi>great there,</hi> Psal. 76. 1. Ephes. 3. 21. <hi>Ʋnto him be Glory in the Church through Christ.</hi> And through all his Works praise him; yet his Saints bless him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145. 10. And they speak of the Glory of his Kingdom, and of the Glory of his Power, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And where but in the Assembly of the Saints? <hi>Praise wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee in</hi> Sion, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 1. that is in the Church, where the sound of Praises Eccho again, and Resound in every Heart and Multiply, and is made more Glorious, therefore says he (Psal. 35. 18.) <hi>I will give thanks in the Great Congregation; and I will praise thee in the presence of much People;</hi> for that is the most proper place of Praise, and of making his Name Glorious.</p>
                  <p>This Fellowship of Saints in a Church, is <hi>all through the Spirit,</hi> Ephes. 2. 22. <hi>Built through the Spirit:</hi> 1. It is the Spirit makes them Saints, and so fit matter for this Building. 2. It is the Spirit, and not Man, that makes them willing, and moves their Hearts, to joyn in this Ordinance. 3. It is the Spirit, that gives all the Gifts that are in the Members. 4. It is the Spirit that is that Energy (as the word is, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 16.) through which every part supplies Nourishment to others.</p>
                  <p>The Definition of a True Gospel-Church, will Result out of the recollection of all these forementioned parts together. <hi>It is a company of Saints Assembling together in one place, built by a special covenant into one Distinct Body, which, as occasion is, is to be fitly ordered to enjoy constant Fellowship with Christ in all his Ways and Ordinances; to their own mutual edification, and the Glory of God through the Spirit.</hi> And the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of it may severally and apart be considered, as included all in this Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The true, and only true matter of this Church is Saints visibly obeying Christ, and a true profession of this, is the only true Adequate note of the matter of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Special Relation which they have to Christ, and one to another in this way, and the Fellowship with Christ, and with one another, is the true Form of a Church. The mutual agreement works that special Relation, and is the Instrument of conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Matter and Form.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Order and Right Administration of the Ordinances, and disposing of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is the <hi>Forma Externa, the External Form</hi> of this Body. The Blessed Spirit that Acts and Breaths in all the <hi>forma Assistens, the Assistant Form,</hi> and their own Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and God's Glory, through Christ their Head, is the Final cause of this particular visible instituted Church.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That Jesus Christ hath given Liberty and Power to his Saints, to imbody themselves into Congregational Churches. That in doing so, they are not guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of sinfull Separation or Schism.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have seen, that a particular Church is the Institution of Christ, and what this Church is, and of whom to be made up, and how: There yet remains to shew the Rise, Original of such Churches, and to clear it out, and by whom any such Churches are to be Reared, Erected, and Begun, and Set up; and in whom the Power and Authority lies to begin and Build, and gather together Saints into such a Church. Which we must consider; for otherwise; though the thing done is Lawful and Warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and is God's Ordinance; yet we may still be ask't (as they ask't Christ) by what Authority do ye these things?</p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:154381:131"/>
                  <p> For the building of the Temple, it was not only necessary, that a command and Institution could be produced, that such an House was to be built; which though <hi>Moses</hi> gave express Warrant for, but yet this was not Warrant enough for every one to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to Build it; no not for <hi>David,</hi> for though he was the King of <hi>Israel,</hi> and so had the Supream power in the Common-wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> committed to him; yet it was beyond his Commission to Attempt the Building it, till he should have a Special Commission from God to do it, as God tells him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. He indeed provided Materials, and gave the Platform; but <hi>Solomon</hi> was only to build it, <hi>v.</hi> 13. As therefore we are to look to a word of Institution, that it be done, and to a right Pattern and Modell how it be done, and to right Materials, of whom this House be built; so as much also to the true and lawful Power, by which it is to be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and by whom it may be built. For as the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells us, (Heb. 3, 4.) <hi>Every House is built by some Man;</hi> so this House must have a lawful Builder.</p>
                  <p>All Assemblies (as at first I intimated) must be conveened by lawful Authority; and so must this. Now though it is Warranted to be set up in Christ's immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution; yet the setting of it up is done by Men, whom Christ Authorizeth to do it. He Reareth it not as he doth our House in Heaven, without Hands (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.) but his Temple here below, as that of <hi>Solomon's</hi> is made with Hands; and the Rearing of it runs through the Hands of some, as the Builders of it.</p>
                  <p>Now there are that pretend to have this power as of Governing; so only of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and giving Warrant to Saints to make Churches: Who yet will be found to prove in this, such Builders as the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who refused the head Stone, and neither build truly themselves, according to the Pattern, nor will suffer others. And they are such Magistrates, and such Church-Governours, who would call in all Church-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, not erected by themselves, with a <hi>quo Warranto?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This power must certainly lie somewhere, else it were an Institution in vain, which could never be produced into Act. Now this is that which I am about to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. That as the Saints and Members of Christ Mystical, are only fit matter for this Church; so they have an immediate Independent Power and Authority from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, their immediate Head and King, to gather and combine themselves in such an Assembly, without expecting Warrant from any Governors, what ever on Earth: I shall first explain, and then prove it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ministers make not a Church, nor are they or their power requisite to the first gathering of it. The Ministers or Church-Governors, even those that begat to Christ, have not this power of casting us into Churches, and Disposing us herein. So far as they had a hand in begetting us: So far they may have a hand in it, that is by direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to it, and exhorting us unto it; but the power is in our selves immediately. And there is this Reason, why the power of gathering Churches is not Dependent on them, because they are to be set in Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. There were Churches gathered, e're Elders were made in them. And then besides, if such a power was Resident in the Ministers, then when they dye, a Congregation should cease to be a Church. We are not then to a-wait the leave of Church-Governors, for the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Two or three Saints have an immediate power from Christ, to begin this Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is so in Christ's Institution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. The Writ or Commission for it runs immediately and singly in his Name, not in the Kings, nor in the Ministers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because his Power and Authority is Warrant enough. Neither is it the meaning only, that when so gathered, they should do all in his Name, but even to <hi>Gather</hi> themselves into a Church, is in his Name. For if the very gathering together, be an Ordinance of it self to frame a Church thereby; then there is the same reason of it, that there is of all other Ordinances. And therefore as when gathered, they have power in his Name, to Excommunicate in his Name, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. and to Baptize in his Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so to gather in his Name too: And as a Magistrate hath power to forbid those an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to be Administred, so not to hinder this other. For if gathering together it self be an Ordinance, as it is, it therefore hath his Name put to it, as well as the rest; and they have not power to intermeddle in it, nor is their power to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the one, more than for the other. And besides Christ's bidding Saints to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Name, is as if the King should in a Commission, say to such and such
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:154381:132"/> when ye are gathered together in my Name, do thus, which implies, that he gives them power in his Name to meet. </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Christ did thus immediately in his Name ordain it: So the Apostles taught the Disciples to practice it as immediately from Christ, without expecting leave from Magistrates or any other; and what they taught them to do, we may do to the end of the World. And there is the same reason for doing it under Magistrates, Christian, as Heathen; for the power is but the same. The Apostles bad them not forsake Assembling themselves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. He speaks not only to particular Persons not to leave the Assemblies; but to the whole Churches of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not to forsake Church Assemblings, not to break up their meetings, notwithstanding they were Persecuted, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. And so for the same reason, we are not to forbear to Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And the true Radical Fundamental grounds of this are,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because as Jesus Christ is the King of Saints, so he is an immediate King unto them, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 22. As God hath given him to be over all things, so over all things a Head to his Church; so as in this point of Head-ship, no Inferior power on Earth doth come between. In all matters which immediately do pass between, and which concern him and them in this Relation, he is an immediate Governor to them; and hath put none of his power out of his Hands, to Magistrates or the civil power. And therefore his Ordinances they are to exercise and enjoy, without any immediate Commission from Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As he is thus immediate King; so he hath Reserved this power to himself: And you shall find that Christ mentions this his Transcendent power, to this very purpose. He first sent his Apostles out to Preach, and make Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. All pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is given to me in Heaven and Earth, (says he) <hi>Go ye therefore and make Disciples,</hi> (as the word is) <hi>and Baptize them, and Teach them to do what ever I command,</hi> whereof this, as was shewn, was one. And in this saying, <hi>I am not with you only, but those that believe on me, to the end of the World, (ver.</hi> 20.) Christ mentions his Supream Power, and shews that he was able to command and make good this; for he had power over all. He commanded it, and promised this. And with all to see the equity of it, consider that he who is over all, and hath derived much of his power to Kings and Magistrates, his Vice-gerents on Earth, hath Subjected the Estates, Lives and Persons of his Saints as Men, as well as the rest of Men to them; yet that which concerns Spiritual power between him and them as their King, he reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himself, as a so exempt flower of his Prerogative. And it is as equal he should assume it and ordain it thus, as it was that God should reserve to himself one day of Seaven, having given us Six. So doth Christ allow Magistrates power in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral things over Men, and all Creatures here below; only his <hi>peculiar People,</hi> and <hi>Royal Nation,</hi> as they are Saints, and in things pertaining to him and his Worship, he hath Exempted them. The Magistrates are indeed to use their power, to see his Laws kept; so that this Liberty of ours, is not to be maintained and practised of us, as our Liberty; but as Christ's Prerogative, which we his Courtiers are not to suffer to be encroached upon, or diminished.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As he is thus a King immediate, and hath reserved this power to himself; so he hath given and imparted all to his Saints, that might fully enable them, and qualifie them for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By giving them Right, and such a Right, as is Natural to a Saint, as a Saint; and therefore can no more be encroached on by them, then Natural Liberties of Men, as Men May be invaded. The Saints (as was said) by reason of the Divine Nature do breath after a Fellowship one with another, even as every one as a Man, doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fellowship with one of the same kind. It is not good for Man to be alone (as God said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18.) And therefore he Created the Woman, and besides Instituted that Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Marriage in Paradise, for the comfort and propagation of Mankind. The Right unto which Fellowship, and the comforts of it belongs unto a Man or Woman as such naturally, as likewise there is a Natural propension to it. So likewise to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie this common desire in all Saints, of having Fellowship together, Christ the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this New World and Generation, ordained this Ordinance of a Church, and Ordinances to be enjoyed in it, for the Building up of the New Creature; and the Propagation of it to others. And likewise the Right unto this Fellowship, and the Ordinances of it doth reside in a Saint as a Saint; and so in all Saints, whereever they be. So Christ says of Children, Mar. 10. 14. <hi>Suffer them to come to me, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid</hi>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:154381:132"/>
                     <hi>them not, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, they have Right in me, as well as you, and in some Ordinances, as well as you. But more expresly the Holy Ghost speaks, Rev. 22. 14. <hi>Blessed are they that do the commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and to enter into the City.</hi> He speaks of that Glorious Church, afore the end of the World; which was that City; and the Tree of Life is Christ, in the Ordinances of that Church: For so to <hi>Adam,</hi> the Tree of Life was a Sacrament of the Second Commandment. Which Tree of Life standing in the City, a Man must first enter into, and be admitted into the City; and then to the eating of that Tree. So that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He that doth the commandments, and is a Godly Man, hath a Right as such both to the Sacraments and to a Church-fellowship: But to the Sacraments but Remotely; and not till first admitted into the City. So that a Saint's immediate Right to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, is founded in a Church-State, into which he must first be admitted; yet such a Radical Potential Right he hath, as he ought to be admitted; as every Man as a Man, hath a Right to Marriage comforts, but yet remotely; for he must be Marryed first, and entred into that Fellowship, and then he hath an actual Right.</p>
                  <p>But 2. He hath to a Church-fellowship, a more immediate Right, so as there is nothing betwixt him and it; but only that others joyn with him in it, as in a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-fellowship it is.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unto this Fellowship and Ordinances none other have Right, ver. 23. <hi>Without are Dogs, and that make a Lye, false Professors,</hi> and Rev. 21. 27. <hi>There shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As they thus have a Right to this Fellowship and Ordinances (Christ having ordained them, and them alone, as the Children's Bread, and not for Dogs) so Christ hath given them an immediate power from himself to enjoy these Ordinances, not deriving it from any other power whatever, but his own. Wherein it doth, in part, differ from that Ordinance of Marriage, to which, though a Man hath a Right as a Man, yet Parents have power over their Children (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 37.) to enjoin them in this Ordinance, that their consent be asked, and obtained. But it is not so in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination Spiritual, unto which a Saint, as a Saint, hath both a Right and full power to cast themselves, and joyn in such a way immediately; not only without asking Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate's consent. Who as in Marrying of the Subjects, they have no power in any Common-wealth, nor are to have, (it being an Act of Natural Right, not Civil, and so out of his Bounds) so much less have they power in this Spiritual Union, it being a Spiritual Right, which is Transcendently more out of the Sphere of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Power. Also according to the Law of Nature, King's have nothing to do with Family Government and Order, to appoint whom I shall admit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> because their power presupposeth Family Government first: Much less have they power in God's Family-matters.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Tis true indeed, they have a power to permit it. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> gave commission to build the Temple, and protected them in it. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> bids them in their Congregations, to <hi>Pray for Kings,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 2, 3, 4. <hi>That they may lead peaceable Lives in all Godliness,</hi> and so in all the Ways and Ordinances of it. And that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the Saints have, when Magistrates are Godly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have power to exact the performance of Christ's Laws. Magistrates have a power to punish Saints that are either Subjects, if they neglect any Ordinance, and so if they neglect among the rest, this Duty of casting themselves into Assemblies. And God's good Hand may be with them in such commands, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. When <hi>Hezekiah</hi> sent out commands to the People to Assemble to the Passover. ver. 12. <hi>The Hand of God was to give the People one Heart, to do the commandment of the King, by the word of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. They need not to expect their power or leave, for their gathering into a Church, as if without it, such a Combination were unlawful; nor to forbear out of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their Prohibition. If indeed they used force or persecution actual, they might forbear their Assemblies as the Disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1. and scatter themselves; but not because of the command simply, but the Persecution; because God will have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Christian Magistrates have no more power herein, then Heathen Magistrates; for his conversion encreaseth not his power, but Sanctifieth it. And therefore
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:154381:133"/> not as Christian Magistrates are we to expect their leave if we have immediate power from Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christ hath invested his Saints with such a power, by giving them power to Judge of, and to call each other to come into such Church-Fellowship. <hi>Let us go to the Mountain of the Lord, Esa.</hi> 2. 3. For the Spiritual Man Judgeth all things, and is Judged of none; and therefore is Supream Judge in things Spiritual, as this meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is: As he is a Judge of Truths (so as he needs no outward Judge in Doctrines) so also of Persons. And if they have power to Judge them within, without the help of Magistrates power; then also to Judge whom to take in.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Christ Invests them with this Right, by communicating his Offices to them, even as <hi>Moses</hi> put some of his power upon the Elders; so hath Christ on his Church. They are Kings and Priests, and made so by him; and if so, then in what they are Kings, they are Supream, and Independent, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 6: And as he is to have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Government over them; so they are to have towards one another in his Church Fellowship.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Kingdom is too Transcendent for the Sphere of any Inferior power to deal in. For their's is but of this World; but my Kingdom, says Christ, is not of this World, <hi>John</hi> 18. 36. And if they have nothing to do in things Natural, which Men as Men have a Right and Power to do, much less in that which is Spiritual, and which belongs to Saints as Saints.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a Liberty that Christ hath purchased for his Saints: Which, whatever it be, we are to stand fast in, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. Now this is part of our Liberty, that in matters of Worship; which are things of another World, we are not Subject to Ordinances of Men, 2 Col. 20. <hi>Why as living in the World, are ye subject to Ordinances,</hi> In things of this World, you may be so, but not in things of another World; such as Christ's Ordinances, whereof the Fundamental one is this of Church-Fellowship. Which Liberty, though the Defence of it, hath cost us our Liberty in the way we once went in, and in the Ordinances then enjoyed; and so in some things, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in some times, may be a Snare; yet it is a Royalty, which take all times and seasons (that may run over the Churches Head) is for our Advantage, that by vertue of it in all times, we may enjoy the Ordinances as freely from Christ in one time or Age as in another.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. For that was the end why Christ ordained it thus. For if Christ had not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en this immediate Independent power to the Saints, as well as Right, then they might in some Ages, yea, in most, never have enjoyed that which they had a Right unto; and so that Right would have been in vain. But Christ did not leave his Saints so Destitute; but that as he gave them a fitness for a Church-Society, desires after it, a Right to it, and Ordinances to be enjoyed; so he gave power to enjoy them Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently, let Magistrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be in all Ages what they will.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what Power and Liberty we have to begin a Church: But then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, the question and case will further be put; that we living under Christian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, and among Churches and Congregations allowed by them: What War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may we have for this apart, and Clanculary practice, of setting up such a Church as this?</p>
                  <p>In answer to this, suppose them Churches we will, as indeed I will not Dispute it (only to any of you that think them not; you have the fuller Warrant for that Practice, Warrant enough for that opinion; which I have not) therefore I will go upon Supposition, and such grounds, as all may and will agree in.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though they are Churches; yet if you were never truly Members of any, you are free to begin where you will; and so to be of the best. This liberty we under the Gospel have, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had not; for there being to them but one Church, and that was National under the High Priest; they were in no case, to set up another; and but in case of Idolatry, to remove from communion with it. But now under the Gospel, Churches may be erected every where by Saints, and 'tis free to them to joyn with whom they please. Now for us, whether any of us may account our selves Members of any of their Churches, needs not much examining. To give our selves up to such a Fellowship with those, with which we did partake the Ordinances, was not our Intention then; but we came to receive Christ, as Members of his Mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body, and so as such who had a Personal Right to Christ, and that was all. Which Acts, though God accepted, winking at our Ignorance; and for those times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:154381:133"/> of receiving Sacraments, accepted them as Church Acts; yet not such as to oblige us to the Congregation we received in; we intending no more special commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Saints therein, in one than in another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though they are Churches before God, and so to be acknowledged by us, in our opinion of them; yet they are not such as necessarily we should be tyed to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in; and not to remove from.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because they are Churches defective in Ordinances, it is Warrant to remove to such a Church, where all may be enjoyed (which, do what we can, could not be in them) and this by vertue of that liberty mentioned under the Gospel. So as it is not a Removal from no Church to a Church; but from a Defective Church, to a Church more compleat in all Ordinances of Prophesying, Offices, Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in such Churches, where the Admission useth not to be Formal, the leave to depart needs not be Formal.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because they are Defiled Churches to our Judgments, and so Defiled, as to continue in them, a Man himself would become Defiled also; in this case a Man may remove from them; and therefore much more he may choose, whether he will ingage in them when he is free. For though they remain Churches to my Judgment still (as a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous Man is a Man) and that because they are so in God's acceptation; yet to me they are the same as no Church, if I cannot enjoy the Ordinances in them; or shall be Defiled in the enjoying them. So as they may be Churches as to their State, when not in use to me.</p>
                  <p>As 1. If to the free enjoying any Ordinance, any thing sinful must be practised; as in receiving the Sacrament, let that Church be in it self, and in my Judgment otherwise never so Reformed, yet if this be imposed on me, or I must not receive; it is no Mother to me, for it denies to me her Child, the Bread which is due to me as a Child's Portion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In other practises it is so Defiled, as that I cannot constantly be a Member in it, but I must also be Defiled; as in mixt receiving, in which since the wicked are made one Body with the Saints, there is a sin which lies somewhere, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. 17. And if that the not exercising this power, which is due to a Congregation, and which they are not to forbear to exercise, in casting out such is a sin of the whole, and it be a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not to joyn with them: Then I am not to partake constantly with them (because then I should partake of their Sin) in such a mixture, and should also sin in omitting the Ordinance of withdrawing from them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. The command being, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 24. That God's Laws shall be kept in all the Assemblies, (especially seeing by the Godlies presence, they become Assemblies; and God vouchsafes unto them that priviledge) they again should see to execute his Laws, which from Christ Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently they have Transmitted to them. However, if this Practice, and Omission, be made but doubtful unto me, it is to me a Sin to continue among them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though it should be granted, that I might occasionally receive the Sacrament in them (as being Churches <hi>pro hac vel illâ vice)</hi> yet it will not follow, that I should be a constant Member to continue with them. For in such an occasional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, I am not so made a Member, as to be called to exercise any such Judicial Act of casting out the bad; but it lies on them who are constant Members of it; who by their Approbation, make themselves one Body with them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 But in even such a receiving occasional, I am not to partake, till I am a setled Member in some Church: For, as was said, this is a Church Ordinance, which, as a Mystical Member of Christ, a Christian hath but a Remote Right unto. And therefore I must be in a Church, ere I partake of it any where. And seeing we are not so in theirs, Original Members, it is necessary we be of a more pure Church, e're we can be capable of receiving the Lord's Supper.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This Church-Society therefore is not a Separation from them, as no Churches in themselves; but as no Churches to us in use. For Separation is so to part from them, as to condemn them for no Churches (as when the Saints came out of the World, they are said to Separate from it, as condemning it as lying in Wickedness and Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate) but so we separate not from them; not as from no Churches to our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but as none fit for us to joyn with.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This, our not Separating, we may testifie by holding such communion with them, wherein we may not be Defiled; and by vertue of this our Church-Fellowship, have this further improvement by their Ordinances, as to partake with them in a New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:154381:134"/> And so it is not a Separation but a new moulding of a new Church more compleat, as whem a Man that pulls down an old House, and builds with the same Materials a new one more compleat. And herein we may do as the Saints did in <hi>Hierusalem;</hi> they were joyned in a Church-Fellowship-Christian, and yet went to the Temple, and enjoyed the Ordinances there, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 46. Which <hi>Jewish</hi> Church they Rejected, not as no Church, though such as was to vanish afore the new.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It need not trouble us, that this is not a visible Church (that is in the exercise and profession of it) for though that would be more comfortable; yet it is not of the essence of a Church, it being but an Adjunct. And it is called visible, not in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a necessary visibility to others; but as to themselves, and one to another. For so, in the Primitive Times, their Congregations were not things visible to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men; but in secret to themselves, the Church being fled into the Wilderness.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. No Danger is to Restrain us from doing our Duty herein, as in the Primitive Times it did not, when Persecution was more hot than now, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25, 33, 34. 'Tis true, God will have Mercy rather than Sacrifice; but then, if the enjoying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice be a greater Mercy, than the loss of what is hazarded can be, if both being put into the ballance, Sacrifice is the greater benefit of the two, compared with what is hazarded, then we are to choose Sacrifice rather, even by vertue <hi>of that Rule,</hi> that <hi>as the Body is better than Rayment, so the Soul, than meerly Liberty or Estate.</hi> Tho' in case of Life it would alter; for then you take away the Subject which should enjoy the Sacrifice it self. Therefore when the Persecution was but the spoiling their Goods, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 33, 34. they forbore not to Assemble; but when it touched Life, they Dispersed themselves, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 1.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>That it is necessary there should be various kinds of Officers in a Church, and that each should be setled by a Divine Institution.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I shewed before, what the constitution of a Church is, that, as it was to be a Body of Saints, so also <hi>an ordered Body,</hi> as <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 5. is intimated, and elsewhere, which Order, as I then said, noted out two things. 1. Enjoying all Ordinances. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. compared with, <hi>v.</hi> 24. The Lord's Supper is reckoned a part of the Apostolical Orders; and <hi>ver.</hi> 1. the Institutions of the New Testament are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Traditions, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 2. That Order, consists in their Ranking their Members into such Offices, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Gifts as Christ hath appointed; that so all the Ordinances might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.</p>
                  <p>I shall now shew the necessity of Officers and Ministers in a Church.</p>
                  <p>It may abundantly convince us, that Heb. 6. 2. <hi>Imposition of Hands,</hi> is reckoned as one of those six points, which are of the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and first <hi>Principles</hi> of Religion, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. laid by those Master-Builders, and by the sign used at the Ordination and calling of Officers, the use and power of the Ministry, and Officers of a Church is meant; and placed here next, and conjoyned with the Doctrine of the Sacrament <hi>(Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> being here put for both, as breaking Bread is elsewhere put for the whole Lord's Supper.) because the one is conjunct with the other: Answerable unto which in the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is, tasting the good Word of God; which useth to be Dispensed by those Officers. The partaking of the Holy Ghost, is especially in Baptism and the Sacraments; and he usually is powred forth more abundantly at the Sacrament. This establishment of Officers in a Church, is not indeed necessary and fundamental to the Personal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a Christian, yet unto the Building of them up, which is as necessary as Conversion.</p>
                  <p>And therefore answerably: The course of the Apostles was, first, to go to plant and convert Men to Christ, and then to knit them into Church-Fellowship; as <hi>Acts</hi> 2. v. 47. And then a while to leave them till Men fit for Offices, should be sound amongst them by Trial of their Gifts, and soundness of their Conversion; and then to send Evangelists or themselves again to visit them: Both to confirm them in the Faith, and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:154381:134"/> also to settle Officers and Elders amongst them, according to Christ's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>in every Church</hi> these Officers were setled, so <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> returned to <hi>Antioch, Iconium, Lystra,</hi> confirming the Disciples; and when they had chosen Elders in every Church, with Prayer and Fasting they departed, <hi>v.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>And where themselves could not come they sent Evangelists, as <hi>Titus</hi> to <hi>Crete,</hi> 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 5. <hi>for this cause,</hi> to ordain Elders in every City, where Churches were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: So as the great care and work of the Apostles and Evangelists, was as first to gather Churches: So then to set Officers over them, and so to commend them to their charge, and God's grace: so in <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20. 17. 28, 32. for then they made account they had provided for them, as much as in them lay; even as Parents, do when they see their Children Marryed, and well bestowed. The use, and excellency, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of them to the Church, might many ways be demonstrated unto us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. These Officers and Gifts, are the Joynt and Distinct work of all three Persons. They conspire and have a Distinct hand in framing them for the Church, as well as in the Great Work of our Salvation; Father, Son, and Holy Ghost meet in the making and ordaining Officers: And each Person distinctly contributes something. As we gather the Excellency of the Creation of Man, above all Creatures, because the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity say, <hi>Let us make Man;</hi> and so of Redemption, that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, set their Hands to it, and bear Offices in it; so we may infer the greatness, necessity, excellency of Officers in a Church and their holy Communion, because all three Persons, not only as in other Works, but distinctly and apart concur unto it. So we have it at once told us; and we need not have Recourse to several places for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5, 6. Those three Persons are the three Great Officers in our Salvation: And these Officers in his Church, are the lesser, Christ is the chief Pastor, they the Inferior under him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. and so are co-workers with the Trinity; shall all three Persons concur to constitute them, and shall we neglect to have them?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are the Gifts bequeathed us by Christ at his departure; and his last Gift must needs be a great one, and so to be esteemed by us, and made use of according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. To have a Gift given (which is ordained simply for use, or else it is made vain, and ineffectual) and to let it be unused, what a slighting is it of any ones Love? If a Garment be given as a Legacy to wear, what a contempt of the Donor's Gift would it be to sell it? Now Officers are Christ's Legacy, and his last Legacy. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. when he ascended, <hi>He gave Gifts to Men,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> at his Ascending, obtained a resting of his Spirit on <hi>Elisha,</hi> and what were those Gifts, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. save Apostles, Pastors and Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and mark it, the Gifts given, that make them to be Pastors and Teachers are not alone said to be the Gifts, but the Men endued with those Gifts, and put into those Offices; <hi>Pastors, Teachers.</hi> The Ministers themselves are Gifts, and so their Gifts became of double and treble use when Officers, to what before when private Men: Thus in like manner, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. of the <hi>Levites</hi> it is said, to you they are given as a Gift for <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and as to serve <hi>Jehovah,</hi> so them also. And <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 7. <hi>Aarons</hi> Service is termed a Service of Gift, and next to God's Son, and Spirit these are the greatest Gifts, because convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of both to us. If a precious Jewel were given you, would you not place it in a Ring where it might shine, and adorn you? If a Loadstone, which of it self would draw; yet would you not set it in Steel, that it might draw more, and not let it lie unuseful? Thus do with the Gifts of Men among you, which in Office will be more Serviceable, shine more, give a greater Lustre.</p>
                  <p>And the rather do this, for thereby you give their Gifts again to God. and return-them to him. So when the <hi>Levites</hi> were consecrated by the Imposition of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Hands <hi>(Numb.</hi> 8. 9, 10, 11.) They were offered as a wave Offering says the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> to the Lord, and as a Gift says the Septuagint, that they might execute the Service of the Lord. Some Services you cannot do without them, and so God is a looser of Worship which is imperfect without them.</p>
                  <p>And then 3. God in recompence again will come, and be more present with you then before. For this compare but, <hi>Ps.</hi> 68. 8. with that, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. it being the place whence these words are taken. <hi>Thou hast given Gifts to Men to dwell among them.</hi> When Christ ascended, he became absent from his Church, therefore when he ascended he gave these Gifts, that by their Ministry he might dwell in their Hearts by faith more, and also by his Spirit. By these Officers he Buildeth the House more and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:154381:135"/> more, and adds to it both <hi>intensive</hi> and <hi>extensive</hi> more Members, and more Graces; <hi>(Ephes.</hi> 4. 12.) for the perfecting the Saints, and building up the Body of Christ, (as also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. 16.) and when he hath built them up, and the more, the more he dwells among them; and the more he delights to do it when the House is finisht, and furnisht with all his Officers. Your selves love not to dwell in an unfurnisht House, you would have all utensils, and Servants of all sorts about you, you will stay Removing till a House is Furnisht, and as God brought Man into the World not till it was Finisht, so doth Christ. God would have his People first become a Church, that he might meet and dwell more among them, then when the Stones lie scattered here and there, so <hi>Mar.</hi> 18. his promise to invite us to be a Church is, I will be in the midst of you; and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 48. 35. The Name is, <hi>The Lord is there;</hi> and then when you have Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Ordinances dispensed by them, then you have a further presence, he will come down oftner amongst you: The more of Ordinances, the more of Christ; the more of Officers, the more of Ordinances.</p>
                  <p>And 4. The effect of them, and God's dwelling will be growth in Grace: So it follows, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4: 13. Till they all come to their fullness of the Stature of Christ: As in the Body after it is begotten, God hath appointed Ordinances of Food, Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the growth of it: And if any of those Ordinances are wanting, there is a decay of strength or Health, and a defect in Growth; so if any Ordinances be wanting to the New Creature, you will find the defect of it in your Souls, and for all such Ordinances for growth, Officers are appointed, and their Ministry, so <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. After they had Elders, he commits them to their charge, and the word of his Grace in them to build them up; his Speech implies that they were all converted, else they had not been of a Church. They wanted now nothing till they came to Heaven but building up; so it Followes, <hi>to give you an Inheritance with them that are Sanctified:</hi> And there is that near connexion between Heaven and building up in Grace, because growth is as necessary to bring us to Heaven as Conversion, as therefore you would think the Ministry necessary for the Salvation of your Children to convert them; so of your own Souls for growth in Grace; so as you cannot be Saved, unless you grow to such a pitch, to that fullness of Stature which in Christ God hath appointed you, except ye be converted says Christ to his Disciples, you cannot enter into Heaven, as well as except ye be born again; and though many have grown to that perfection without Ordinances, being ignorant of them; yet none that know and may enjoy them, and therefore also of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ministry it is promised, he should save himself and them that heard him. So as they are necessary to a Man's Salvation, that knows them to be Ordinances, and Ordinances appointed.</p>
                  <p>If you ask the reason of this connexion and necessity, 'tis true it is not absolute, as was not Christ's Satisfaction, as Christ intimates when Praying the Cup might pass, he says, <hi>all things are possible;</hi> but yet it was necessary, because it was God's will so to have it: Thus God could save you, build you up without Ordinances, and so he hath many; but yet hath appointed these, and having appointed them, to those that know it, they become necessary; though they are not such in themselves; yet because so it hath pleased God. The reason we find of Diversity of Gifts and Administrations, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. God hath set the Members in a Body, as it hath pleased him that is all his Reason, and answerably that which he says referring to this, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. that God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, is for the same reason also: It is as if you should seek a reason why Bread and Wine of all Creatures, are Typed out to be Elements Sacramental: There is no reason but so it pleased; so if you ask why these Ministries, there is no reason but so it pleased him, and there was no reason of necessity absolute but only the will of God: For he that Governeth the Angels and the Church above us, immediately by his Spirit, and all the Creatures below us (who yet continue to this day according to his Ordinances, in their course he set them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 91.) in which course they are acted by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible power of his immediately concurrent, could in like manner have governed Men, yet chose as to have the World of Men governed by Magistrates: So his Church also by Officers of his own Institution and Appointment, and as of all other of God's appointments else, so of this we may behold and admire a Glorious and Wise har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and conveniency and suitableness, that so it should be.</p>
                  <p>What in particular is the conveniency and necessity of each Office in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular, as suited to all particular necessities of a Church, I will shew when I speak of each particular Office, and their distinction. I omit also their
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:154381:135"/> use and necessity in respect of them without, to convert and add Men daily unto the Church, which is one great end of their Office mentioned, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 12, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which imports the joynting in Members into the Church, and gathering in all the Saints, and making their number perfect as others read it.</p>
                  <p>Now we chiefly speak of in relation to a Church Instituted and their edification, which is the other end there mentioned, where he also tells us that these Institutions (as also this Ordinance of particular Churches) shall last but till that General Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or concourse of all Saints in their perfection, as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies, when there shall <hi>be but one Fold, and one Shepherd, John</hi> 10. 16. But untill then, he hath appointed the Ministry of Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whose Ministry we enjoy not in their Persons but writings; and ordinary Officers we enjoy in their personal Employments: We will but take the Reasons which he doth there insinuate.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the Church is under Age, (which he implies, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.) therefore she is to have these Officers over her, untill she come to a perfect Man, and to the full Stature: And Children under Age now as well as then, are to be under Tutors and Governours, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 2. And though we are not in such Bondage to Beggerly Elements, but compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively are Men grown; yet as we are not perfect Men, not come to that full Stature we shall come to, so far, we are still left under the care and eye of Tutors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, who yet are not the Heads, but Servants of the Church.

Which argues God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite love and tender care towards them, for their Education; yea, Though there be but two or three of them in a Congregation, yet he will not let them Travel here without a Guide, (as the Apostle calls their Elders, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.) so his promise was of old, Jer. 3. 14, 15. <hi>I will take you one of a Tribe and one of a City, and give you Pastors</hi> (not <hi>Pastor</hi> only) <hi>according to my own heart.</hi> The Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Training up of his Children, God accounteth of to be a matter of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er concernment, than you can possibly esteem of the Education of yours, because, according to their growth here, they are ranked and placed in that body of Christ hereafter, where, if any Member should not have its full growth, the disproportion of a Member would reflect upon the Head, Christ, and cast a deformity on the whole, therefore every Member is to grow up to that Stature which Christ hath appointed it; and hence answerably God takes care for them, and thought it requisite to make it the proper and sole business of Men enabled, with the greatest gifts that ever were poured out upon Men, to attend and look to the bringing up of his Children, and thought it not enough for Men to have gifts, but for the improvement of them, to have Men set apart to such Offices, as might be separated (as <hi>Paul</hi> unto the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. and so <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.) the Phrase is taken from the <hi>Levites,</hi> who <hi>Numb.</hi> 8. 14. are said to be separated to do the service; or, as the Septuagint have it, to the work, which word the Apostle useth, <hi>Ephes</hi> 4. 12. for the work of the Ministry, is a business of that weight, that they are to give themselves wholly to it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. First, God tendred so much the instruction and proficiency of his Children in the knowledge of Christ, which is mentioned here, that he contented not himself to have them enjoy such occasional means as the Brethren in communion were able to afford each other, as their callings and occasions should permit; (though we all were able to Prophesie) but he would farther have Men of the best and eminentest gifts set apart usually unto it, by continual labour to perfect themselves, and his Church. As in a School or Colledge, besides what Pupills may get out of Books, and mutual conferences daily with others, Parents provide Tutors for them, and Colledge-Officers, University professors are set apart to study what to read unto them; so God would shew himself more careful, for his and he would not have his children rendred too extemporary, he would have them fed with the finest fare, and therefore would have Men dedicated to his Service; yea further, he would have them grow in knowledge and grace, and every age to exceed another, which is tacitly intimated (as it seems
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:154381:136"/> to me) in the 12. and 15. <hi>verse,</hi> he would have as every Member, so the whole Church grow till the day of Judgment: And one age to sow, and another to reap a more plentifull Harvest; now this would not have been in an ordinary way and course, unless Men were dedicated to this work, for every Scribe instructed to the Kingdom of God, brings forth out of his Treasure things new and old, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 52. If <hi>Timothy</hi> will profit and have his profiting appear to all, he must give himself wholly to it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. He must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, and he must have a Treasure, and that not of Coyn only, of present cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant money, but he would have his children enriched with importation of new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and to be such a Scribe requires the whole Man, such an one was <hi>Ezra, ch.</hi> 7. 6. 10. <hi>Ezra</hi> was a ready Scribe in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> that is, versed in it and the meaning of it, and the good hand of God was on him, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. For he had prepared his heart, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. to seek the Law, that is, to search out the meaning of it, and to do it, and to teach in <hi>Israel;</hi> yea further the Apostle otherways intimates, that without Men being set apart to it, there would have been no preserving of knowledge, but the ordinary sort of Believers would have been exposed to the danger of being carryed away by Seducers, so, Ephes. 4. 14. <hi>That we henceforth be no more Children,</hi> &amp;c. I take it, he makes it not so much an inference from the former by way of instruction of what we therefore should be, but goes on to shew the ends of these Offices, and the Word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is all one with <hi>alias, otherwise, &amp;c.</hi> And indeed <hi>otherwise,</hi> our running into error could not have been prevented. For ordinary sort of believers being children not fully grown up, would easily have been seduced, if they had not had guides committed to them, who had been able to convince gain-sayers. The Apostle useth many Metaphors to express their danger herein, as First that they are children, and how easily are they deceived, Secondly, in danger to fluctuate as a reed in the water, this way and that way, and to have been in doubt what to hold and stick unto; and Thirdly, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be carryed about with every wind of Doctrine as Ships in the water, if there be no Pilot nor Mariners that know how to steer and guide them. And therefore the word used by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. concerning ordinary Officers is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is Governours of a Ship, <hi>Cubosa</hi> being used in <hi>Cicero</hi> for the greater kind of Ships then used, built square, and so it follows in, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 14. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in the Ship of Men, as <hi>Beza</hi> says it may be interpreted, wicked and naughty Men, if learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would have driven the Ship whither they had pleased; To prevent this he appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them Pilots, the Apostles, who left also behind them Writings, and ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Teachers, who should be more then ordinarily skill'd in their writing, and be Pilots unto others. And as in that part of growing in knowledge, so likewise for their lives and manners God would have them watched over, and would not trust the care hereof to that which every Brother would have one of another; but thought it worthy of some Mens whole pains and care, to whom he might commit the charge of Mens Souls to watch over them, and of whom he might receive an account, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 17. Even as in Colledges (besides private helps of Tutors) there are publick Lecturers and Deans to instruct and overlook the whole, so jealous is God of his Church and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and carefull of their Education. And there was need of all this, and all little enough; and other wise if this business had been, in common, left to the common care of every Member watching over each other, there would have been a defect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As many Officers are necessary for the growth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of every Member in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, so for the publick managing of common affairs amongst them, for every Church is a Body, a Common-wealth, a City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which by vertue of their combination will (as all Societies) have many businesses in common that will concern the whole, every Church will have their <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Apostle speaks of the affairs of the Church of <hi>Philippi,</hi> 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 20. Church businesses, as Corporations have common Town-bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses, and as he intimates there, there had need be some to take care of them, to prepare them, to contrive them, to study them, to manage them, these common businesses are admission of Members, Excommunications. To examine Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in case of Scandal to judge of the cause, to give a just weight to the sin according to the ballance of the Sanctuary. It was an especial Office of the Priests under the Law, to teach the people to discern between the clean and unclean, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 23. And in all these things, not only is it requisite simply for Order's sake, that some do in the name of the rest propound, discuss, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but also for the ease of the whole, and not only so, but for the better managing and dispensing all things, when Men shall make it their business to study Church affairs, as Men in Authority do those
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:154381:136"/> of their Common-wealth; and Lastly, it conduceth to the more faithful managing of them: For otherwise that which is every Man's business, is no Man's; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon businesses, if not committed to the especial care of some are ordinarily neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and miscarry as we see in ordinary experience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is necessary that there should be many Officers in every Church, unto whom the exercise of Church-power may be especially committed, tho' the power it self be wholly in the Church it self, whose Servants and helpers they are, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 1. 24. and not Lords over them, and it is fit these Officers should be constantly the same, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Fellowship is to be constant (as was shewed) and through long experience they will be better exercised in such affairs, as they give themselves wholly unto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> It was for the great Honour of Christ and of his Church to have such Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, as Servants to attend his Royal Spouse and Queen, and Children. Princes you see have for every small business that belongs to them, an Officer on purpose because their Persons are so great, that no business might be forgotten or neglected <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at concern them. Now such provision hath Christ made for his Church, that as Princes Children and Wives have their Courts apart, and Officers apart, so hath the Church whilst here below; yet she keeps a Court, and hath Servants to attend her. You may read, <hi>Est.</hi> 2. 2, 3. how Officers were appointed to gather together fair Virgins for the King out of all Provinces, and how <hi>Stegai</hi> with others, were to purifie them for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed. So did Christ appoint his Apostles and their Successors his Officers as children of his Bride-chamber, (as <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 11. He calls them) who should purifie and adorn his Spouse for him; and they are jealous over them with a great jealousie, to present them as a pure Virgin unto Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                  <p>In like manner in the Type, for the Honour of the Temple, and the service of it were there so many sorts of Officers and Attendants to watch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when there was no need: And so it is reckoned up amongst Christ's Honours, <hi>Psal</hi> 44. That, as his Queen stands at his Right Hand, so that there are Honourable Women, Kings Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that are Her's and his Servants, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to bring her to him, and her Virgins, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. From the necessity of them to us, we will descend to the Institution of them by God; which dependeth only on God's will.</p>
                  <p>I shall now then discourse of the Institution of these Officers by God, which depends only on God's Will, which is our rule in this case. It is God that hath set the Members of the body as it pleased him; and as of the Members of the body, it is said that they are set down in his Book, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. it is all one here, for in like manner it is said, God hath set in his Church, some Apostles, some Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Members of that his Church, and in his book we must find them all written too. Our Parents who yet are the Fathers of our Bodies, cannot say how their children should be formed, what Members they would have added, nor do they contribute any thing to the ordering or placing of them: But God's Pencil secretly draws and limns them; nay, we our selves cannot make a hair black or white; or add a cubit to our Stature, can much less add a Member which God hath not written in his book. So wonderfully and fearfully are we made in the lower parts of the Earth, and shall we think that any, though Spiritual Fathers, can dispose of the Members of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ; yea, of that Body, which <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12. is called Christ's, and speaking of Officers, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. He says, he hath set Apostles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is the same in both, and it implies, he hath done wisely, to an end, deliberately, and not at random; but in a wise and orderly manner.</p>
                  <p>Authors of the Gifts of the Members in the Church, all will confess they are not: They are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, given us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. and Authors of the success of those gifts, and the operation of them, Men will acknowledge they are not: <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> water, but God must give the encrease, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. But yet Men think they may appoint Officers how these gifts may best be improved according to their discretion and intention; but what says the Apostle in the Chapter afore cited, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

In like manner the same Lord Christ Author of all the Administrations or Offices in the Church, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. which is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, as whereby those gifts should be successfully employed in the Church. And nothing is more ordinary than the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> used there, to signifie the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:154381:137"/> or Ministry, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Apostleship, <hi>Rom,</hi> 11. 13. of Evangelists, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as gifts are there suited and ordained to Offices, and strained in a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for them; so both of them for operations through God's blessing even as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> and means suited to such an end, now it is the same power that appoints the end that must appoint also the means, and here in this case especially, seeing the effects allways of these means, dependeth on God's blessing: If Man therefore would undertake to appoint a new Office, he must be able to give new gifts, and to give a success; but so he is not. As <hi>Moses</hi> then blest the Tabernacle, <hi>Exod.</hi> 39. 43. when he saw all made according to the pattern or will of God; so God will accompany his own Institution only with a blessing; nor can any promise themselves a blessing farther. And so as the Apostle makes an enumeration of several gifts, as ordinary, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and extraordinary, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so after an illustration from the several Offices of Members in the body, from <hi>ver.</hi> 12. He shews, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. these several Offices God hath set in the Church; both extraordinary and ordinary: And the reason of it is, because.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The three Persons as was said, sharing the glory between them, to make Christ to have a less hand in his share and allotment; and proper work, than the other two in the other, how dishonourable were it for him.</p>
                  <p>As it were Sacriledge for any <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to think to bestow at his pleasure, the gifts of the Holy Ghost, and dishonourable to the Spirit, so as dishonourable is it to Christ to think at pleasure to appoint Officers in the Church; and as great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge every way, especially, seeing Christ challengeth it as his own Prerogative, and that as the Lord, King, and Ruler of his Church; he reserves the power of instituting and appointing what Ministries shall be in his Church. Every King will challenge it as his Prerogative, to appoint what Officers shall have his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er imparted to them, as the Elders had from <hi>Moses:</hi> Though the people choose the Men, yet <hi>Moses</hi> made them Rulers, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. and God gave them of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Spirit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 17. 1 <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13. And allegiance is sworn to the King as Supream, or unto inferior Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors as sent by him as having his power imparted to them, thus Supream are Kings often: And shall not Christ the Lord be thus Supream, and there is as much reason for the one as the other, and more; for as the businesses of a Kingdom are the <hi>King's matters</hi> and so called, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 11. so the matters of the Church are the Lord's matters, and so called there in that place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Second Reason is, because every Officer in the Church hath the power of Christ imparted to it, and he must communicate it. I have all power in Heaven and Earth says Christ, and he bids them go and teach; and this he speaks to all that should teach to the end of the World, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. Christ's power is a part of his Image, and it is High Treason in Man to stamp it upon any but by his Authority. 'Tis true that Officers in Civil things Men may appoint; which Officers (and not their Laws) as the coherence shews, are therefore called, by way of distinction, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Humane Creation</hi> or Institution, thereby to distinguish them from Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, which Officers in the Church are; and every such Officer is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a Creature,</hi> and a power must go to make it; But it is such a Creature, as all the power of Men and Angels cannot make, none but this Lord from Heaven: A Man <hi>can receive nothing</hi> (says <hi>John)</hi> speaking of power in things Spiritual, and of Christ's Ministry, except it be given him from Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 4. 27. and the like Christ again intimates of <hi>John</hi>'s Ministry, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 25. The Baptism (says he) that is by a Synecdoche; the whole Ministry of <hi>John,</hi> was it from Heaven or from Men? Whereby he expresseth it to be unlawful if from Men. And the like <hi>Paul</hi> says of his Ministry and Apostle-ship, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. That as he had Christ's full call to it, it was not given of Man, that is, it was not meerly Humane. And if it be said that these things are true of such extraordinary callings, the answer is, That <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4: 11, 12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. ordinary and extrardinary are made alike in this respect that Christ gives them, and so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. where he tells us, that God sets them in the Church; he reckons up both ordinary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. No, Christ is the Lord, and appoints his own Administration here on Earth; he is Lord over his own House, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. and fit it is he should appoint by what kind of Officers his House should be governed, Luke 12. 42. <hi>Who then is that Faithful and Wise Steward, whom his Lord shall make Ruler over his Houshold, to give them their portion in due season:</hi> Mark it, it is whom the Lord shall make. Now such great Officers are Ministers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Moses</hi> and all the Apostles were but Servants, as 'tis there, and did all by appointment. He built not the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:154381:137"/> House, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. there, nor added any thing of his own Head. All Officers in that House, and their distinction then was according to the pattern: But Christ is Lord, <hi>Timothy,</hi> an Evangelist, he must take Rules how to behave himself in the House of God, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 3. 15. having mentioned Officers to be ordained, in the verses before. So then Christ is to give orders for God's House: And as he is the Lord, the House is his own; and he is a faithful Lord, much more then <hi>Moses;</hi> and he as a Lord, built the House, <hi>ver.</hi> 2, 3, 4. and so as faithfully as a Lord, hath appointed all Offices in it, and things pertaining to it: As <hi>Moses</hi> whose faithfulness lay in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by pattern. It was part of his last work mainly after his Resurrection, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2, 3. Then he spake of things pertaining to his Kingdom; and it is observable that it is placed at the beginning of that work, called the Acts of the Apostles, shewing the Scope and Argument of what should follow to be, especially those things which concerned his Kingdom; and that Book contains not so much the Doctrine as example of the Apostles in ordering Churches. But if it be said, such Institutions as these are such petty matters of his Kingdom, as he reserves them not to himself, but leaves the disposing of them to Men; the answer is, he is Lord, in respect of Administration, and so as Lord, hath reserved them to himself; and Secondly, to appoint What Officers are in a Kingdom, is a main appurtenance of it: And if the Lord so ordained in all Churches, for the maintenance of these Officers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4. Then, what the Officers should be, much more. For Men to appoint Officers of the Church, is to make Christ a Servant, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Lords, and the Institutions then would not be perpetually binding. But as they are from Christ, they are of eternal obligation. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They proceed from Christ as a King and Lord, as that place shews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. where he mentions his Kingly Office, as the foundation of sending them Apostles, and <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. The entrance into his Kingly Office, by his ascension in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, is made the cause of giving gifts, when his priestly Office is subjected to his Kingly, as afore his Kingly was to his Priestly: Now his other Offices remain for ever, and the Laws of them all are the same. In his Priesthood, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 10. 14.) He consummated for ever with one oblation, all that are Sanctified; and his prophetical Office, gave Rules of Faith but once for all; <hi>Jude</hi> 3. and why should not the Institution of his Kingly Office also be thus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26, 27. yet once more I shake not the Earth only, but Heaven also: And this word, <hi>yet once more,</hi> signifies the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of these things that are shaken, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain: And we have received a Kingdom cannot be shaken, and so the means of his Kingdom are unchangeable, he had spoken of the change of those who are Servants, and Officers under the Law; but in the Kingdom we have received or do receive (so that he speaks not of that State in Heaven, but of that under the Gospel, which is called <hi>the Kingdom,</hi> in which Kingdom there should be no more such change) the Offices now are unchangeable, and so is the work. And therefore, in the closure of that Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> wherein he had discoursed of the ordinary Officers of the Church, he sets an Apostolical seal upon it from him, and all his Successors in him which was never to be violated or broken up, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13, 14. I charge thee to keep this command to the day of Christ's appearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is, all the commands of this Epistle, for else he should not be blameless. And though here he says commandment in the singular, yet <hi>ch.</hi> 5. 21. where he makes the like observation, he says, <hi>These</hi> in the plural. His way of expression is observable, he says.</p>

They are so sometimes put into the Catalogue with the extraordinary, promiscuously, and the ends of both made one and the same; because the Ministry is of the same use and necessity to the Churches in these times, in that way as that of the extraordinary was in theirs, so <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10. And the best way to distinguish the one from the other in such promiscuous enumerations, and to discern which are ordinary, which are not, is to consider what gifts are still in the Church, and what are ordinary standing necessities of the Church, and what not, and so we shall discern them as in the places cited. As in the Church we find still gifts of Teaching in differing ways powred out on Men, and abilities with Spiritual Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion and Authority, to guide and govern others, more eminent in some Men; and bowels and helpfulness in others, to Administer to the necessities of poor Saints. But we find Apostle's gifts of Miracles and Tongues ceased, and so we may in those places mentioned, distinguish the one from the other; and may thereby know, which of these Officers here mentioned are to remain, which not; for God gives gifts in Relation to Administration. So as there doth remain these ordinary sort of Officers, God continuing no gifts in vain, but fitting the one to the other, as <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 5, 6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8. evidently implies.</p>
                  <p>In this enquiry, we will consider 1. How an Officer differs in general from an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Member. Then 2. What these Officers are, and how differing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. As to the <hi>First,</hi> He is a Servant of the whole, separated to some special work, with special authority in the name of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is a Servant of the whole, so <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. not simply a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to serve one another occasionally, but more; he ceaseth to be, <hi>Sui Juris,</hi> as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do. Of <hi>Epaphras</hi> he says, not only that he is one of you, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 13. but <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 7. who is for you a faithful Minister of Christ. All his Strength, Pains, and Abilities are theirs, and to be laid out for their Service, to spend and to be spent, Phil. 2. ver. 17. <hi>Tea, and if I be offered up upon the Sacrifice and Service of their Faith, I joy and rejoyce with you all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Separated to some special work, so the Deacons,</hi> Acts 6. 3. <hi>whom we may appoint over this business.</hi> As the Apostles chose other Ministers, <hi>to give themselves continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the word and prayer, ver.</hi> 4. So as though a private Member doth the same work, yet he but occasionally, the other makes it his business, his calling, his employment; a Brother, when he sees his Brother want, is to distribute to his necessities, but a Deacon's Office is to seek out who want, and in discretion to distribute the Alms of the Church; that as the Sabbath day differs from other days, that on other days, ye are to perform Holy Duties occasionally, but the Sabbath is set apart for nothing else; so do private Members differ from an Officer; it is the value of the day, it is the season of it; so is some special service, it is work and employment; <hi>Archippus</hi> must take heed to fulfill his Ministry, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 17. Every private Member is to advance his Brother, but it is an Elder's work to do it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is invested with special Authority, and an Authority of right, to do that lawfully in some things, which in others he could not. Let a Man so account of us, as particularly priviledged and authorized to be the Ministers of Christ, and Stewards of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. somethings they are so Stewards of, that they are kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Lock and Key; and without them the Church cannot come to them (as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are continued to be) and other things they do administer, which others may, which are yet administred by them in a more special Authoritative way, not simply out of gifts, as when they Teach or Admonish, but out of a special Authority of Christ withal, as Ambassadors, as if Christ did Admonish and beseech, and not a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 20. And though to Admonish others gifts, might serve as well; yet, the Dispensations is not from inherent gifts so much, as an interested power Authorising, <hi>virtute officij, by vertue of Office;</hi> thus a Colledge Seat cannot be set, unless they have a Governour (because an exercise of power is necessary) tho the fellowes may have power to choose and install that Governour. <hi>John</hi> speaking of Christ's power to Baptize, says it was a special power from Heaven given, <hi>John</hi> 3. 26, 27. And in the Name of Christ and the Church, the Act of an Officer is as the Act of the whole in Administring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not so as to the Acts of private Members, not so as to every Administration of a private Brother.</p>

                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:154381:138"/> 1. They are not only many but <hi>diverse,</hi> so we find almost every where, where we find them spoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 5. There are diversities of <hi>Gifts</hi> and Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so Rom. 12. 6. <hi>Having gifts differing,</hi> he says not, greater or lesser, but <hi>differing, &amp;c.</hi> which Gifts and Offices are not only different in nature, but in the person also, that is, that several Persons have several Gifts and several Offices, for so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. To one is given the word of Wisdom, to another the word of Knowledge, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 7. Every one hath his proper gift, one after this manner, another after that, and so much as to the Scope of his Similitude, drawn from the Body as he brings it, For in the Members all have not the same Offices or Action, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. so as his meaning must be, that several Gifts, and so Offices, do belong to several Persons. And the Preface the Apostle makes, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 12. 3.) is that every Man is to think soberly, or within his own compass, of that measure God hath given him, every Age hath but his part, not all; The word Translated, <hi>Sobriety,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, signifies a sound mind; a sound Member swells not, so as all are to keep within the compass, neither thinking too highly of their Gift or Office, nor stretching themselves to an higher or other calling then is given them; for says he, the Members in the Body have not the same Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. 8. mentioning these Offices, he doth it not simply by naming several works, as Teaching, Exhorting: But as relating to several Persons design'd to these works; he that Teacheth, he that Exhorteth: As if he should say of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Body, let that which heareth, hear, that Member, which seeth, see, as having several Functions, so as there are several and distinct Offices, in several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. And the reason why God hath many, and those distributed Offices severally, and a several part to be performed by them, is because God would have no one do all, but keep all in Sobriety, (seeing he hath but his measure) and in mutual ease and charity, that (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) One Member should not say to another, what need have I of thee, that all might both partake and communicate: As also, because the several works in Offices would be too much for one; those Master-Builders need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed helps, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 3. And it is for Ornament unto the Church too, which ariseth out of such a variety. And another reason of it is, that so each work might be the better and more throughly done, when every one should according to his gifts, have a several part given him; which he was wholly to give himself unto. In Arts and Sciences, and Professions, none prove Eminent, neither are they advanced and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted but such as give themselves wholly unto some one Science, and it is the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Jesuits, in disposing of their Followers in several professions. And this wisdom and care God hath taken for his Church, as a great Man, that would have his Children Educated in several professions, sets over them, not one, though somewhat seen into them all, but procures the most eminent in all kinds, wherein he would have them instructed, one to read Philosophy, another Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That therefore which is chiefly to be done, is, as to enquire how many there are, so also especially, what the diversity or difference is, to seek out the formal distinction between Office and Office, which is a matter every way, of exceeding great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That confusion in the Offices, and the performance of them, should be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which God hates, being the God of Peace and Order, and also that God's own Institution be rightly kept. We see how strict God was in keeping the bounds of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Priests and Levites, they being distinct Offices, <hi>Numb.</hi> 3. 10. Thou shalt keep the Priest's Office, and the Stranger that comes nigh shall be put to Death; and by <hi>Stranger</hi> there he meant not only their Brethren the People, but even the Levites their Fellow-Officers; <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 40. And God requires the choosers, that they take a right estimate of Men's Gifts and Offices, and suit them according to their proper difference and distinction, that a Man's gifts, like waters, may have their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural current to run in, and so as they shall not need to use Art to force the streams another way, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 20. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 2. that so they may naturally take care to feed the Flock, not in any the least way of constraint, no, not in respect of their gifts, to which a violence is offered, when they are not rightly placed. And so their gifts are to the utmost improved, and their work the better done; For the edifying of the Church. It is an error (as the Author of the Tryal of Wits, in his Preface com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth) and a great error, like that which <hi>Solomon</hi> complains of, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 6, 7: in disposing of dignities unsuitably, that in Common-wealths there is not a suiting of natural endowments and callings, to the great detriment of it: There being no Man's natural parts, if rightly placed, but would prove eminent: And the like error if commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:154381:139"/> in Churches, is much greater; by how much the gifts and callings therein are more pretious.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore enquire into what these are, and wherein their diversity consists, which is eminently the proper Scope of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. That Epistle is, of all Epistles, written in a System and Form of wholsom words, methodically composed, as might be shewn; <hi>Credenda,</hi> or matters of Faith, he had handled in the eleven first Chapters, and then <hi>facienda,</hi> or matters of practice from the <hi>12th</hi> to the <hi>16th</hi> Chapter (which he spends in Salutations) the instructions concerning their practice, are as Methodical as the other, and are either their Duties as Members of the Church, in <hi>chap.</hi> 12. or as Members of the Common-wealth, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. and both in a like method. 1.

                     </gap> may signifie Spiritual Worship in the mind, opposed to bodily Service. As the best preservative of their Worship Spiritual, and prevention of Formality and Human addition: He exhorts them not <hi>to be</hi> conformed to the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Holy Ghost foresaw that the Worship and Service in the Church, and that especially of <hi>Rome</hi> would be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the conforming of it to the Rites and Ordinances of the World, <hi>Heathenish</hi> and <hi>Jewish:</hi> And the Government of the Church shaped and configured to that of the Empire, in all their Officers and Members, as many have excellently shewn in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and was foretold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 15. The Holy Ghost foresaw that the Pope should set up the Image of the first Beast, that is of <hi>Rome Heathenish,</hi> a Religion like theirs, and a Government like theirs. <hi>Item,</hi> The Apostle exhorts them negatively also, not to conform themselves to the World, <gap reason="foreign">

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Spiritual Government of a Church, and the Spiritual Worship of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as much as any other Truths whatever, a Spiritual Heart which they are most suitable unto, and that Carnal Mind or Wisdom which is in all Men, is most oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site thereto, and would frame it its own way: Therefore he exhorts them to be Transformed by the renewing of their minds, <gap reason="foreign">

I say to every Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Phrase there used <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:154381:139"/> charge, observe his Preface, <hi>I say, through the grace given to me,</hi> he speaks modestly, yet lays a command from his Apostolical Authority, which he averreth and alledgeth; for so grace is used by him to express his Apostolical Office, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. And makes it <hi>Sanctione Apostolicâ,</hi> but to put the more weight upon the exhortation, and also to own and warrant their Institutions and Rules about Church-Government, to be Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical and perpetual. Now, the Rule it self which he gives in general, and then appoints and brings home to all the Officers of the Church in particular, is, as we Translate it; <hi>Not to think more highly of himself, than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every Man a measure of faith,</hi> which of all Rules else, in the Latitude of its meaning that could be given, is to Church Officers the most pertinent and fit, the most full and comprehensive, both tying them to the diligent performance of their several Duties, and confirming them within the proper bounds of their Function: And it is the best prevention of all confusion, innovation, or addition, and exorbitancy in Church-Offices, and likeliest preservative of that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity which was established, and wherein also, the Holy Ghost (as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer about Worship) strikes at the Root of that corruption of Pride and Ambition, and stretching themselves beyond their Line and Authority, which was that true main reason of all Transcendent Usurpation, which in future times, Officers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church especially took upon them, and after their Example all other Churches, So as both this Rule, and that exact Platform and Enumeration of all Offices, with their bounds and distinction, was the most seasonable and necessary for this Church (which was foreseen to be the Mother of Abominations) of any other, which is the reason (haply) why the Apostle is more distinct in it, than in any other Epistle. We have first the Rule, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and then, 2. An Illustration and Demonstration of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it, by a Similitude between a Natural Body, and the Members thereof; and a Spiritual Body, and the Members thereof. And 3. Application of that Rule and Form of that Similitude to all Church-Officers in particular, which to that end we on purpose mention, with their distinction and diversity.</p>
                  <p>We will, First, enquire into the true and proper Scope and meaning of the Rule, which we shall find to fall full and close with the particular Duties of Church-Officers. It hath two parts we see. 1. Forbidding Vice, that we should not think too highly above what we ought.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Commanding of a Vertue, <hi>but to Rule our selves with Sobriety in such thoughts.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which we Translate here to <hi>think of a Man's self:</hi> Upon the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which word, which is used thrice in composition, in this short Sentence, doth the whole depend, it is of a larger annexion, then any one word either in Latin or English is able to express, and that which is Translated, is the least thing intended.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It hath Relation to Knowledge, and <hi>sapere,</hi> not to be wise about what is meet, which is a most pertinent direction to the chiefest of Church Officers, not to affect curiosities of Knowledge, falsly so called, above what is written, as those, 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. that intruded into things they had not seen, or above the reach of their own Gifts, but to keep both to the measure of their own Faith and Knowledge, and also to the Analogy of that Faith once delivered to the Saints; and the like also is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in those that Rule, in whom as Godly Wisdom is as requisite as any other Grace, so affected Wisdom, and to shew themselves more wise, to controul and meddle in every thing, is as unsuitable.</p>
                  <p>But I think it hath not mainly a Relation to Knowledge; for he says not, be wise not above what, <hi>Licet, is lawfull,</hi> as having Relation to unlawful objects forbidden to be known: but not above what <hi>oportet, is meet for his place,</hi> or becomes a Man's place and gifts.</p>
                  <p>Therefore 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, <hi>cura,</hi> and is all one with that Phrase of ours, <hi>He minds his business,</hi> it signifies intention, and what the mind is taken up about, so <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 5. We Translate it, those that after the Flesh, do mind the things of the Flesh; the word is the same: So as it hath special Relation to what is a Man's Duty, and place which is given him to mind and to regard: And then the first part of the exhortation is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not to mind or take upon him, what is above him, or as <hi>David</hi> speaks, not to exercise a Man's self in things too high for him, (as <hi>Psal.</hi> 131. 1.) For his place, calling, function, gifts, or as <hi>Paul</hi> saith, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 1.) not to stretch a Man's self beyond his own measure, not into another Man's line, nor to thrust his sickle into another Man's harvest.</p>

                  <p> And then 2. That other particular commanding a vertue, which we have here Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>to think of himself soberly,</hi> should be Translated, soberly to keep himself and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention too within his calling, and function, and duty, <hi>[as he ought]</hi>

                     </gap>, is an exhortation to both, it is to have a sound mind, a comparison taken from the Body, which is then said to be sound, and a Member sound, when it is kept in its natural equal and due temper, and every part performs its own office, swells not above its compass, exceeds not in heat and humours, nor is defective in what belongs to it; so when a Member of the Church swells not above his rank and place, but executes what belongs to him, then he is said to be sober, and of a right temper in his place. And so then that which follows <hi>according as God hath dealt to every Man the measure of Faith,</hi> directs and shews Men what it was every Man was to put forth in his place, <hi>viz.</hi> that measure of Spiritual gifts which God had parted diversly among Men, which gifts are to be suited to Offices, as we shall see anon. For by Faith here he means not primarily, justifying Faith, but Spiritual gifts for the good of the Church, superadded to Faith, which yet he calls Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not natural, but had some work of Faith as their Foundation, whether saving or temporary, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. This the Apostle plainly intimates, when he shews that those Spiritual gifts they had not among them, till they were converted to the Faith; but then were endued with them. When you were led after dumb Idols, you had none of these gifts but you had them by a work of the Holy Ghost, enabling you to say and assert, and believe that Jesus was the Lord which assertion was the foundation of all those Spiritual gifts that follows, and so here called Faith; as also because that in the exercise of them, Faith should be the director of them to the good of others.</p>
                  <p>And then 3. The words may withal be interpreted as they are Translated, as aimed against pride and overvaluing a Man's gifts, which the Apostle also aims and strives at, as the root of all that ambition and affectation of preheminence in Church-Officers; and so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> will also bear that Sense; and so to be wise to Sobriety, is for a Man to give a due estimate to his gifts, and put them forth accordingly; and hence Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is fully defined (as here.) A Sobriety or Moderation of Spirit, which only keeps a Man within his compass; and the contrary swells him to matters above a Man's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and compass, and therefore <hi>David</hi> joyns them both together, Psal. 131. <hi>My Heart is not haughty, neither did I exercise my self in things too high for me.</hi> And the drift of the reason implyed in the following words, argue this to be his Scope.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is God that guides those gifts, and that of Grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, and 6. and why should thou boast of what is received.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou hast not all the gifts, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he doth part them: We have gifts dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of that very gift which thou hast received, thou hast but a measure, a portion, nor that in the fulness of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Others have gifts as well as thou; yea, every Member hath gifts, God hath dealt to every Man, so as thou cannot say thou hast no need of others. So as his Scope is at once to beat down Pride and Ambition, as the cause and affection of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence, the sin of <hi>Abiram, Dathan,</hi> and of <hi>Corah;</hi> who, being Children, affected the Priesthood, and also he meant to keep every Man to his own calling and place, diligently to execute it to the good of others, wherein, how did the Holy Ghost (in Writing to the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> strike at the very sin which he saw then working in that Church, which corrupted and perverted all the Officers in the Churches of Christ, even as he foresaw Superstition would corrupt the Worship, as was observed in the former verses.</p>
                  <p>The Root of that Mystery of Iniquity, and foundation of it, was laid in Church-Officers asserting of preheminence, the lower Officers assuming what belonged to the higher, as the Deacons did; and then the higher taking upon them all the power of the Inferior; yea, and of the whole Church it self; as to admit Members to Excommunicate, to Ordain, to Rule and Govern, and so to thrust out Deacons and Ruling Elders as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:154381:140"/> and those it left continuing to make them shadows, and then these greaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Officers presumed further to extend their power over other Congregations besides their own.</p>
                  <p>The Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> began to be from thence, to challenge Universal power over all Churches, and from being an ordinary Officer, to challenge that extraordinary power of Apostles themselves, and to sit in the Temple of God as Gods, and not to be content with Spiritual power neither, but to challenge Temporal also; to dispose of Crowns, curb, restrain, and cut short the Spirit of Princes; and his Bishops also began, and have continued to intermeddle in affairs of State. That ever of so small an Egg, as a poor Pastor of that Church, so foul and monstrous a Crocodile should arise so, great a Prince, is that great Mystery which all the World may wonder at; as it did indeed admire his greatness.</p>
                  <p>How seasonably therefore was this Rule given to prevent ensuing mischief, and how necessary was it also in the Application of this Rule, to give a complicate and exact platform of Church-Officers, and their true bounds and distinction of their places to this Church above all other, who was to become the Mother of abominations. How seasonable was it to leave this Apostolical Canon in her <hi>Archivi,</hi> in her Records, to discover the falshood of those which she boasts, and to shew all the World in after times, how much she was swerved from her Original, and likewise to enjoyn the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of these Institutions, with an Apostolical charge as his Preface shews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>I say, through the grace given me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Scope therefore of that which follows, is to illustrate this Rule, and to shew the equity of it from a Similitude drawn from the Body; and then to apply and bring it home to every Officer amongst them, that as his charge was to every Man, he says not <hi>omnibus,</hi> but <hi>cuique</hi> in particular, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. so his Application is to every one of them in particular, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. I will not much insist in opening the Similitude, only observe for a Foundation to what follows, that this comparison here, as it is between the Body and such Members, as have general Offices for the whole, so the Church, he here compares the Body unto, is an instituted Church, whether among them, or where ever else. 1. It is a Church (he speaks of) for it is a Body in Christ, <hi>Non in Caesare,</hi> not a civil Body, that is put as a note of difference, for as not only many are requisite: So they are considered not as scattered Saints, but as making one Body, and so knit; and then the Members of this Body, to whom the Similitude is after applyed, are Officers of a Church, and those ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Officers also, for those that follow, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. are the Members. He speaks of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently gifted Members here in general, there particularly, and with application: Now we may take this for a Rule, that where-ever the ordinary Officers that are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ordinants of a Church, as instituted as ordinary Officers are, there the Church or Body spoken of is principally meant a Church instituted, and of the Officers of it, he speaks indefinitely and universally, we being many, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not particularly only, <hi>(you)</hi> because his Scope was to lay down indefinitely, a general platform of all other, as well as of this, unto which they were already moulded, and always to be framed. Now then the fundamental Terms of the comparison being thus suited, his Similitude hath two main parts, fitted to infer those two parts of that Rule deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That as in the Body, many Members make one Body, and so become Members to the whole, and also one to another, for one another's good, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. so in this Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted Body, every one the eminentest, and most gifted is a Member of another, <hi>v.</hi> 5. that is, are ordained for their best profit and good, and safety, as of themselves and the whole, so of every Member, to intend the good of the whole, and of every Member in particular, they are to use their Gifts with consideration of Co-members; and therefore Co-membership should oblige Church-Officers of whom he speaks here, especially to have a care to use and improve their gifts with diligence in their places, for the good of the whole; and not only so, but also to consider eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part in particular, and perform a duty to it, which by their Office they are to do diligently: The eye sees not for it self, but for the whole; yea, for the foot, the hand, and every Member in particular as occasion is, so as diligence in their Office, which is one part of his Rule and Cannon, is hence inferred and argued:</p>
                  <p>But yet 2. They are to consider withal, that every Member hath not the same Office; yea, so far from having the same Office that they have not
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:154381:141"/> the same action: So as tho' every Officer and principal Member is to be diligent the good of the whole; yet not to usurp over the Offices of another, not to do that which is proper for another to do; one Member is not to invade the room of another; the foot is not to undertake to see, nor the Hand to walk.</p>
                  <p>Thus to do would be for the confusion of the whole, and an injury to that Member whose Office is assumed; and to whom it is proper, and its Honour to perform it, and the Member who usurps another's Office, would be less usefull to the whole, and injurious to its self, in perverting its proper Gift and Office to what it is not fit, and so to do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly; and this is the Second part of that Rule given clearly, proven from this Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. Now then in the <hi>6th</hi> and <hi>7th verses,</hi> he goes on at once, both to amplifie that last part of the comparison, that as in the Body, every Member hath not the same Office, so that in this Instituted Body, we are Members having gifts differing (Enumerating all the particular Offices) and also he in the strength of that Similitude, urgeth and applies, and brings home both parts of the Rule in each particular Officer, which he Enumerates. I say, first he goes on to amplifie and inlarge that last part of the Similitude, by a distinct enumeration of all particular ordinary Officers, needfull to such a Church for ever. And so the Co-herence of the words most fitly joynts this verse with the former, for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we are having, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> refer to <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the former verse; the Apostle not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a new entire Sentence, as usually it is read; but continuing these words to the former, as not having made up his comparison compleat: That as he had said, so we being many are one Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so we are withal, having differing gifts also, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which answers to that part of the comparison, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. as all Members have not the same Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And yet withal they are a strange inference, wherein the Apostle brings home and applies both those Duties in his Rule, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to every Officer which he Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and that in the strength and force of the Similitude; so as that Rule given afore, should be put into every particular, and therefore in the Original, there is an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a chink and void space left for the Reader to put it in, as in those first words, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophesie [Let us Prophesie] those words, <hi>Let us Prophesie,</hi> are not in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal; but applyed by the Translators to make up the Sense, whereas that which in General the Apostle had said, <hi>ver</hi> 3. is to be inserted in that, and all the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; and therefore doth best make up the Sense, as whether Prophesie, let us soberly mind our Duty therein, and not be overwise or beyond what is above us, or not ours to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in; but keep to the bounds of that office and duty, which is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Faith, and so in that other Ministry (let us wait on, is not in the Original) but that which he said is to be supplyed; let us soberly mind our Duty in Ministring, and not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to meddle with what is not our office, but keep to Ministring, and so of the rest. So as he doth at once both exhort every one to diligence in their particular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, set him for the good of all, and also dehort him from medling with what belongs not to him, sends a Man to his own Body to learn these Lessons. All which consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, gives a most just and full account, and Reason why the Apostle doth here more distinctly, exactly, and compleatly reckon up all particular offices in this Epistle, which we find not so fully in any other; for it agreed with, and was more requisite every way to this Scope in hand.</p>
                  <p>For 1. The making up the Similitude entire in the Reddition of it, required it. He had said, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. that in the Natural Body, every Member had not the same office (and what are the offices of each Member, nature taught.) Then in the Reddition, and making up of this Similitude he shews, in this Instituted Body, all had not the same offices, by Enumerating all the particular offices themselves and their diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which was proper to do, and also was necessary to do, because they wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Apostolical Institution and God's Will, and otherwise were not known.</p>
                  <p>And 2. His Scope was to bring home that Rule delivered in general, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. by way of application, as in an use of Exhortation or Reproof, a Man doth a general Doctrine by naming all and every of those sorts of Men he would apply it unto, and <hi>ver.</hi> 3. He in laying down that Exhortation, in his Preface to it he had said: This I say to every Man, not <hi>omnibus,</hi> or <hi>to all</hi> definitely, but every Man particularly, as <hi>Musculus</hi> observes, as intending to bring it home particularly to every sort of Men which he meant and spake unto.</p>
                  <p>And 3. One and the main part of his Exhortation, being that officers should keep to their bounds; so it was peculiarly necessary, as to apply it to particulars, so to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:154381:141"/> all and every particular, so to distinguish them, and set them their several bounds, that every one might for ever know his Duty, and not Transgress.</p>
                  <p>And 4. The Epistle containing matter of Doctrine, wherein he had handled a perfect Platform of all other Epistles Methodically composed, it suited with his Scope, that in mentioning the Officers of the Church also, he should be as compleat and distinct, and set down the exact Catalogue and Table of them.</p>
                  <p>And 5. Being written to the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose eminent sin, in after days, was the corrupting of all Offices in the Church, and introducing new, which God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, and excluding those he had ordained or perverting them: The compleat Catalogue of all Offices, their bounds and terms of their Duties and Distinction, was most seasonable and proper to them, as to prevent aforehand, so to that whore of her Abominations and Usurpations herein in after Ages.</p>
                  <p>And 6. To add weight to all, and to confirm these Canons of his to all Ages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably, it was requisite he should set to his Apostolical Authority and Seal; which in the Preface he doth; this I say by the grace given me: And this (as it were) in opposition unto, and to weigh down, in after Ages, that false counterfeit Apostolical Authority usurped, in that <hi>See</hi> which would make other Canons and Constitutions clean differing and opposite to these. His Scope therefore being to enumerate all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and to distinguish them and their Duties, which is the thing we seek, let us go on to observe how Artist like, exactly and fully and methodically, he doth it every way, as he had done all else in this Epistle. He proceeds,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or general division of all Officers into two general Ranks and Orders.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By a Subdivision, containing all the particulars of that general Division, and to prevent mistakes, lest that because seven are mentioned, that therefore so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Offices should be meant, as some have understood them, whereas he intends but five: Therefore the first two, to shew they are but a general Division of these five that follow, are expressed in the <hi>Abstract, Prophecy, Ministry,</hi> but the five particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the <hi>Concret, he that Teacheth; he that Exhorteth,</hi> &amp;c. varying his expression, to make evident the difference.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a general Division of all Officers, into two Ranks or Orders.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such whose Duty and the exercise of their Office, lyeth in simple Ministration, in instruction in the word, the other of Discipline, is that whose work lies in Ruling Mens Lives and Bodies; Prophesie hath Relation by Knowledge to instruct the Mind, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to ruling and ordering the outward Man; and although there were in the Primitive times Prophets of extraordinary gifts, both in foretelling persecutions to befall the Church, as <hi>Agabus,</hi> and others; who also by extraordinary Revelation opened difficult Scriptures: And who are in other places, ranked among the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Officers as <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. Yet here Prophets of ordinary gifts are meant; because he prescribes for their Rule the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Faith to bound them with. Which Rule, the extraordinary assisted infallibly by the Holy Ghost in their Prophecyings, need not to be Regulated by no more then Apostles themselves. The Revelation of the Spirit, being an infalliable Guide and Rule unto them; and also he commands them to abide in that calling, and confine themselves unto it.</p>
                  <p>By Prophecying therefore is meant, that speaking out of the word to Mens instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 3.) Prophecy is taken in opposition to gifts extraordinary, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. compared where he defines it to be a speaking unto Men to edification, and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and comfort; and is put for the ordinary expounding of the Scriptures, which 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20. is called a word of Prophecy, and so is taken often in Scripture, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 57. A <hi>Prophet</hi> hath Honour but in his own Country; and so in that Speech, he that receiveth a <hi>Prophet,</hi> in the Name of a <hi>Prophet; Matth.</hi> 10 41. <hi>that is,</hi> any Teacher or Instructer out of the Word, to <hi>Prophesie,</hi> not being always ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to <hi>foretell,</hi> but <hi>declare,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. 1. God tells <hi>Moses</hi> that <hi>Aaron</hi> should be his <hi>Prophet; that is,</hi> a declarer of his mind for him, so to open the Revealed Will of God is Prophecying: So as by Prophecy here, their Office is understood whose Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is, to open and apply the word according to the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of the Doctrine of Faith, and the proportion of their own gifts, and so is distinguished from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which includes all external ordering and watching over Men, but without labouring
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:154381:142"/> in the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which comparatively is a more ministerial and external work, this more internal and noble.</p>
                  <p>And so now under that general Head of Prophecy, is contained these two first Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices mentioned, <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Exhorting,</hi> and under the other <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the other three more external and ministerial Functions. Giving is the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's Office, Ruling, the Elders, shewing Mercy is the Widows: So as tho' <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is sometimes taken more largely for all Offices whatsoever, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. what is <hi>Paul?</hi> What is <hi>Apollo,</hi>

                     </gap>, Ministers, by whom ye believed. And also more strictly; for that most Ministerial inferior office of taking care of the poor, as <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3, 4. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 15. yet here it being made a contra-distinct Member, it is judged, to be taken in a middle sense between both. For all those are Ministerial Functions which meddle not with the word and prayer, not <hi>ex officio,</hi> so as <hi>Prophets</hi> express a higher Rank of Officers, that <hi>Acts</hi> 6. give themselves to the word and prayer especially; and Ministry expresseth that lower Rank of External Government, either over the Lives or Livelihoods of Men; as the <hi>Ruling Elder</hi> and the <hi>Deacon.</hi> The office even of Ruling Elders, when compared with that of Prophecy, takes place ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Deacons, and is reckoned with that inferior <hi>classis,</hi> rather than with the Prophets: And unto this division other Scriptures seems to give light and warrant, as that (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11.) maketh it also clear. <hi>Let him that speaketh, speak as the Oracle of God,</hi> which is all one with Prophecying here, by the Analogy of Faith, there is prophecy mentioned; then follows, <hi>if any Man Minister</hi> (the word is the same that here) let him do it as God giveth a liberty. There their Deacons are a contra-distinct division to Prophecy: The like I take the meaning of, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3.) where menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is only made of two Officers, <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> the question hath been, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which of these two the Ruling Elders comes? I answer, under Deacon, in that Division; for Bishops there must be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, apt to Teach, which in an Elder is not so necessarily required; many having Ruling Gifts in private, that have not Teaching Gifts in publick; and that also which sways me so to think, is because the qualifications of Deacons here, are such as qualifie a Ruling Elder, as gravity and ruling their own House well, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And according to the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of these places, that of <hi>(Phil.</hi> 1. 1.) may in like manner be understood. To the <hi>Bishops,</hi> that is, the Pastors and Teachers, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons: That is, both Elders and Deacons (strictly so called.)</p>
                  <p>This differing Rank of Officers, seemeth to me also, to have been Typified out by those two orders of Church Officers under the Law of <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> which Type I would not have thus applyed, had I not found it by way of Prophecy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
                  <p>As 1. It is prophecyed that two sorts of officers answering to both these, should be under the New Testament <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 20, 21. I shall be mindful of that Rule, which in the Application of Types, we are ever to follow, that no Types are to be applyed to any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament, but by a special warrant from the Holy Ghost, so applying it in some place of the New Testament, or in some Prophecy of the times of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the Old Testament, because <hi>(Heb.</hi> 9. 8.) the Holy Ghost is alone said to give signification to those Types. Yet so, as when we have a General Type, applyed to design out such a thing; then by those ordinary gifts of Interpretation, we may fetch out the particular Resemblances, as we do in Parables and Similitudes of Scripture, when we know their main Scope and aim, these being also called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 9. 9.) But to return to <hi>(Isa.</hi> 66. 21.) He Prophecies there of the times of the Gospel, and the State of the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> when converted, for <hi>(ver.</hi> 20:) he speaks of the bringing in of their Brethren the <hi>Jews</hi> out of all Nations, as an offering to God, into the Holy Mountain and House of God; (the conversion of a People, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an offering up to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16.) and <hi>(ver.</hi> 22.) he makes mention of the New Heavens, and New Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now as he says, he will bring their Brethren the <hi>Jews</hi> to the Holy Mountain, and the House of God, which is a Church-Estate, (as I have formerly shewed) so he says, he will take of them for Priests and Levites, which design out in the Language of those Types, the Officers of those Churches, all not being meant; for he will take <hi>of them,</hi> and it being also spoken of some of them, by way of distinction, to the rest and multitude of their Brethren, <hi>(ver.</hi> 20.) it Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifies out two general Ranks of Officers in the New Testament, into which all then Instituted, are to be Referred. And so in the Old Testament, I find elsewhere that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:154381:142"/> division made of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> into these three Heads and Ranks, <hi>the House of</hi> Israel, the Multitude of Believers; <hi>the House of</hi> Aaron, <hi>the House of</hi> Levi, as compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all of the Church as so considered, when he calls upon them severally to praise the Lord, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 13. <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20.) even as when, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 1. 1.) He writing to the whole Church mentions three; 1. The Saints, 2. The Bishops, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to their Priests, Pastors and Teachers: And 3. Deacons, the Levites which comprehended all the rest.</p>
                  <p>I will add as the conclusion of this difference and distinction of officers, some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations which suit with these differences upon the Types of these officers mentioned out of <hi>(Isa.</hi> 66. 20.) and for suiting the particular Resemblances in those Types, I will take that liberty mentioned before, which is, having found out the General No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as Priests, to Typifie out Preachers of the word, and Levites, those three other officers I will see what stamps of Resemblance there are in those Types of these offices, which will further clear the difference, and answer a main Argument for the Pastor's Superiorities over Teachers, as it hath been urged by some. Under Levites I Rank all inferior offices, finding a Resemblance in the Type of Deacons over the poor. For there were those that disposed of the Treasury of the Church among these Levites, who (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 20.) were over the Treasury of the House of God, and the Dedicated things, and there were also Ruling Elders among those Levites who were Porters to keep out, and let in to the Assemblies, and the Gate of the Tabernacle, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 18, 19, 20. as these Gospel Elders also are to watch over, and especially to regard with the Teachers concerning Admission, or keeping out of Members to examine and try, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They assist in opening and shutting the Doors of God's House. There were also Ruling Elders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those Levites, who watched the Temple Day and Night, and stood before it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 2. and kept the charge of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. so these are to watch over the Spiritual Temple, the Church, and have their Souls committed to their charge to give an account, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. And then there are an higher Rank of Officers to whom these Levites are giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in assistance, (as the Deacons were ordained, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 3, 4. that the Teachers might more fully give themselves to the Word and Prayer, and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28, 29. are called Helps) even as the Levites were given to <hi>Aaron, Numb.</hi> 3. 9, 10. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 6. The Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint says, <hi>added,</hi> in Allusion to the Name of <hi>Levi,</hi> which signifies <hi>joyned, (Gen.</hi> 29. 34.) and these Officers are these Prophets, answering to the Priests, the Priests being to do many things the Levites were not to do; for Application of that Type.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Priests had the charge of the inward part of the Temple, and <hi>Numb.</hi> 4. 19. they had the charge only of the most Holy things, and the Levites were not to go in, when they were set and covered, and so the cleansing the inward part of the Temple, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 16.) belonged to the Priests, the cleansing of the outward Court to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, so answerably the outward lives and conversations, and the filthiness that appears therein, is the proper Sphere and Jurisdiction of the Rule of a Ruling Elder; but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct and comfort the Conscience, to purge out inward corruption by the word taught and applyed, and inform the understanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is most proper to these Prophets, the Pastor and Teacher.</p>
                  <p>So also 2. The Priests did only burn the incense, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 48, 49. and only did bless in the Name of the Lord; and Sanctifie the most Holy things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 23. 13. so these Prophets meddle <hi>ex officio</hi> only, with the most Holy things of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; being Stewards of the Mysteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. and put up the publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church, <hi>ex officio,</hi> and are the ordinary mouth of the whole, and so giving themselves to the word and prayer, are joyned, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 4. as belonging <hi>ex officio,</hi> unto them. And so to dismiss the Church with a blessing, and to Administer and to bless the Cup of Blessing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belongs only to them.</p>
                  <p>And although the Levites also did Teach, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 3.) and so it might seem that Teachers are Levites also, and that there was no such distinction intended between Teachers and them.</p>
                  <p>Yet 1. To the Priests of <hi>Levi,</hi> that charge was in a more especial manner given, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 8. do as the Priests and Levites shall Teach, and the Priests Lips were an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Ordinance to preserve Knowledge; and so though Elders may now also Teach and Prophecy, as also other Members, (and so also other Tribes might Teach, as <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> proves, and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 7. the Princes also are said to Teach, as well as the Levites, as the Pharisees did whom Christ bad his Disciples hear) Yet the Priests Teaching was that especial Ordinance to preserve knowledge, as now also the Pastors and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:154381:143"/> Deacon's Office is to preserve the unity of the Faith, and to prevent being tossed as Children; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12, 13.</p>
                  <p>And 2. The Elders also have a Teaching, which belongs to them, <hi>ex officio,</hi> yet of a lower kind then that of these Pastors and Teachers; and so some extending that of Bishops, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2.) to Elders also apply that property <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> unto them, and therefore in Common, they are exhorted to feed the Flock, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 1. not by a word of Exhortation or Doctrine, but by a word of Admonition, for any sin committed, or Duty omitted, or Error held, he must be able to convince out of the word, that this is lawful or unlawful; to lay open the sinfulness of it 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. He not only menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons them that labour; that is, in Word and Doctrine; but them that are over you, and Admonish you: That is, Ruling Elders.</p>
                  <p>And 3. Though Levites did then Teach as well, and with the same Authority that Priests; yet Teaching now is one of the most Holy Ordinances amongst us, which among them it was not; but Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> above it, which therefore did fully enough keep up the Distinctions, and made the Priesthood an High Office; but what was an inferior Ordinance then, being in the New Testament one of the Supream Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances now: Therefore that is it that now must make the difference and distinction; and that it is the highest Ordinance appears in this, that <hi>Paul</hi> says of it comparatively to the Sacrament, I was not sent to Baptize, but to Preach, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Wherein the Distinction of the Officers in a Church consists, and what are the due and proper bounds of their several Offices and Duties; the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Pastor, Elder, and Teacher, stated. That they are co-ordinate, and that one hath not an Authority and Power Superior to the other, what are their Distinct Offices and Administrations.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>NOW then I come to search and find out the proper Genuine Distinction of these Offices, which is the principal thing which I aim at; and is principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Apostle, (in this <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.) to the end to set bounds to Officers not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon one another's Duties and Callings, as also to set them more diligently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their proper work; for the clearing of these Distinctions here given by the Apostle, I must premise this necessary Distinction of these Offices. That some of them are, as was observed, Subordinate one to the other, others co-ordinate; that is, some are inferior and superior, more or less authorized, some are of equal power in the Administration of Holy things.</p>
                  <p>The co-ordinate as I shall shew anon, are the Prophets here, <hi>viz.</hi> Pastor's and Teacher's Office of an equal Rank and Power, and their difference is to be sought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the differing manner of Administration or Ministry of the word. But unto both these Offices, there is a Subordination of the Elder's and Deacon's Office; as also of the Deacon's Office to the Elders. Which Subordination, when found out, will help us to see wherein the true difference lies: This their Subordination may be exemplified by the instance of Subalternate Species, that is, the several Kinds and Ranks of Creatures in the Old Creation, as these Officers are in the New, (God having made the one as the other, in order weight and measure) for instance, as there is Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation between Man and Beast, and Plants, so among these three sorts of Officers, Deacons and Widdows are the lowest, <hi>Elders</hi> the middle; and Teachers or Prophets the Highest: Which Subordination that I may explain it, is not in respect of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or derivation of power, as the power of inferior Officers Civil, is dependent upon the Supream as the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no, but all hold immediately from Christ. As Man, tho' a more noble Creature, yet gives not Life to Plants, nor sense to Beasts, but all hold of God as <hi>in capite,</hi> so here too the Tenure is immediate; tho' Antichrist and Bishops would Subordinate Officers, yet it is not so in God's Institution.</p>
                  <p>Neither 2. Is this Subordination in respect of Subjection to any Jurisdiction of the Superior, so as the Superior might restrain the inferior of the Exercise of their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:154381:143"/> as the Bishops take on them to Silence inferior Ministers; no, but every Man hath, as his power, so the free exercise of it, is dependent only on Christ and his Church he is placed in, and that so as in his place and office, a Ruling Elder may with authority ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish a Pastor, as well as a Pastor him, like as Fee-Servants in an House, all know and are beholden, and subject to each other in their place and offices.</p>
                  <p>Neither 3. Is it only in respect of a greater or less excellency in their Functions, that the work of the one is more Noble and Honourable, and deserves double or treble Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; though that be true as appears, by 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. which might have been, though that work the one doth, the more excellent could no way have done.</p>
                  <p>But 4. It is in respect of a larger Commission that the one hath, then the other in the Administration of Holy things, so as the Superior Rank; Pastors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers have <hi>ex officio,</hi> all the power that the other hath, and more; and so the Elders all that the Deacons have, and more: That there is such a gradual Subordination in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se Offices may appear; because the Apostle speaking of a Deacon's Office (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13.) says, he that hath Administred it well, hath purchased to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a <hi>good Degree, &amp;c.</hi> so in that place also, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28.) he Ranks them in Superior and Inferior Classes: First, Apostles, Secondly, Prophets, extraordinary, namely, (as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11.) under whom also Evangelists are comprehended: And Thirdly, Teachers that is ordinary Teachers, under whom by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> also pastors are comprehended, as being of the same Rank; and then after that as inferior to these, among others are promiscuously reckoned up Helps; that is, Deacons and <hi>Governours,</hi> which are Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders. That as Apostles had a larger Commission than Evangelists, being the planters of Churches, and had power over all the Evangelists (being but their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants) in Setling and Establishing them, and as Prophets and Evangelists had a greater power and gifts then Pastors and Deacons, (all which they had and more; for Evangelists had the gifts and offices both of Pastors and Teachers, since the Apostle chargeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to attend to Doctrine and exhortation, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4. 13. but here his Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is, he that Teacheth on Teaching only, and he that Exhorteth on Exhortation;) so likewise have the Pastors all the power that the Elders have; as the Elders all that the Deacons, and what is the work of either, the Pastors or Teachers may do as their lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure serves, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. Originally the Apostles themselves, (as may be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and 1. compared, did perform that daily Administration, but through the burthen of it appointed a special office, that they might attend to their principal and more proper work; yet so as occasionally they might overlook and joyn with them (as they had leasure) in their Administrations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> is also common to the Pastor and Teacher with the Elders, as by this Place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. expresly doth appear, in that he says in common, the Elders that Rule are worthy of double Honour; but especially those that labour in the Word and Doctrine: Therefore they that Labour in Word and Doctrine, are also Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and it is such a Speech, as when it is said God is the Saviour of all Men, but especially of them that believe, whence any Man would gather, that Believers were Men; only further, some special Rank of Men, or as if it be said, Honour all Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in a Colledge, in the University, but especially those that labour in Divinity. There is another place which proves the same thing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 7. so as their Office is to do both, but yet they are in common with another sort of Officers, especially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to that work mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>Now this being premised to find out the proper distinctions of each of these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Offices, these ensuing Axioms, which fully agree with the Apostle's intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here, and elsewhere may give us light:</p>
                  <p>The 1. Axiom is, <hi>That what is common to a Superior Officer, with the inferior may yet be made a proper difference of that inferior Officer;</hi> as for example. To Rule is an office common to Pastors and Elders; and yet, <hi>to Rule,</hi> is made the special difference of such an Officer in this, <hi>Rom:</hi> 12. 6, 7. as he is distinguished from Deacons and Prophets; For it is in this, as it is in other Species and kinds of Creatures, who have something common, something proper, so as Men have all that Beasts and Plants have, and yet when we would express the difference of a Plant from a Beast; we say it is a Creature that hath life in it, when we would express the proper difference of a Beast, we say, it is a Creature that hath Sense, a Sensitive Soul, and so of a Man, we express his proper difference; a Creature <hi>Reasonable,</hi> tho
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:154381:144"/> he hath Sense also, and so the Apostle, in this distinction of Offices, distinguisheth a Deacon by his Office of giving, because this is all that the power of his Office reacheth to, an Elder by one <hi>that Ruleth,</hi> because that is the highest that his Office extends unto, and the Pastor and Doctor by Prophecying, as that which alone is proper to them, though they Rule, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> also.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Second Axiom is, <hi>That when that, which is common to a Superior Officer, with an Inferior; is made the difference of the Inferior Office, it is in respect of some peculiarity in that his work, which makes a true difference between them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thus though to Rule is a Pastor's Office as well as an Elder's; yet the Elder is more especially said to Rule, because he is wholly set apart to it: It is his proper calling which he is wholy appointed to mind, and in a special manner; and so the Deacon's Office is to mind the poor; they are separated to this work, so as to none else: That as I said, all Officers in common differ from private Members, as being separated to some work, tho' withal they do besides retain in common with the rest of the Members the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of all Priviledges and Duties that belong to Members: So it is in this respect in the comparison between Inferior and Superior Officers, though the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or in common performs the same works with the Inferior; yet the Inferior is set apart to it wholly, which the other is not, but to some other of an higher kind; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of intending which, he cannot so fully and wholy intend the other. And therefore it is observeable, that speaking of a Ruler's Office in Ruling, he says, let him do it with diligence; for that is his work which he is to mind, and there will be enough of it to fill his hand.</p>
                  <p>Or 2. There may be a peculiar duty to be exercised by one more than another in the way of Administration, and more peculiar bounds of Jurisdiction in <hi>Ruling.</hi> Thus the Elders Ruling and Inspection and Watching, is only principally over Men's Lives, their outward Man, the infirmities thereof in conversation, but the Pastors and Teachers care is over the inward principally, as their Errors, Temptations, Doubts, Scruples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Teacher also is more especially to Admonish of Errors, and pluck up such ill weeds as are contrary to sound Doctrine; and the Pastor to watch over the doubts about their Estates, and slackness and deadness any way in Holy Duties, and accordingly the People are to make use of them; as they thus have in Ruling their more special walks and works.</p>
                  <p>Or 3. Sometimes there is a difference in respect of eminency, that as a Ruler's work is to Admonish and watch over the Life, so he may have a more special gift that way, than a Pastor or Teacher.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third Axiom is, <hi>That in like manner the Superior Officers, Pastor and Teacher, have besides those Offices common with Ruling Elders a special work, in which they are more Eminent, and attend more upon it than Ruling, or on the Deacon's Office;</hi> (though they <hi>are to mind them also) which is to Prophecy and open the word, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly therefore that gives them their distinction from the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thus they are distinguished from Deacons expresly, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 1. The Apostles whose ordinary Successors these are gave over much of the business of looking to the poor, and establisht an Office for it, to the end, they might continually give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Prayer, and the Ministry of the word; they being to be in publick the Mouth of God to the People, and of the People unto God.</p>
                  <p>Thus 2. Also they are most properly distinguished from Ruling Elders, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 17. Those Elders are such whose Office it is to Rule well, but these are they that labour in the Word and Doctrine: That is, that <hi>ex officio</hi> are to give themselves who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly up to it. To this purpose also may be observed that difference, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 1. in the <hi>7th</hi> verse speaking of Preaching Elders or Prophets, he says, <hi>Remember them who have the Rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God;</hi> that is, that are openers of the word among you; and therefore he adds whose Faith follow, and then at the <hi>17th,</hi> comes in, as a new exhortation, so another Sort of Elders (or else I suppose he would have shut up all in that other) of whom he mentions that they Rule, but leaves, out as a note of difference, that which in the former he added; [that have spoken the word to you.] So as this is proper to these Officers, and not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the rest, (not <hi>ex officio)</hi> to labour in the Word and Prophecy: And therefore in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12. mentioning such Officers as were appointed to gather the Saints, and build them up in Faith and the knowledge of Christ by Preaching, he mentions only Pastors and Doctors, and is silent of the other, as being the proper work of them, not of the other.</p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:154381:144"/>
                  <p> As I have shewed the proper difference of subordinate Officers, it now remains that I should do the like, concerning these two in the Superior Rank, <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Teacher,</hi> which are co-ordinate; of which we must shew the difference also.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some would have made the same difference of Subordination, between the <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Teacher,</hi> that hath been shewn between them and the others; so as the <hi>Pastor</hi> should be alone the Supream Officer, and all the rest his Assistants; and he should have also a larger power of Administration and Government, both in the Sacraments and Censures, from which they would exclude the <hi>Teacher,</hi> from meddling in them: But in any such res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, I cannot find in Scripture any so vast a difference, but every way an equality given to them, only a difference in the manner of Administration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is only a difference as to the Administration of Holy things, not any thing as to power. For then the Scripture would mention also, that the Pastor hath all the gifts the Teacher hath, and more; for it is a Law will not fail us, that eminency of power hath emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of gifts; that fullness of power, hath a fullness of gifts answerable: But God hath shared and divided gifts of prophecying between them, to one, a word of Wisdom, to another the word of Knowledge, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Not to the <hi>Pastor</hi> solely, but so as the <hi>Teacher</hi> is not his assistant, but his com-peer in it; and as their gifts, so their duties here (in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.) are bounded gifts <hi>differing, ver.</hi> 6. so as the exhorter is to attend on exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as the Teacher on Teaching, and not to entrench on one anothers Office and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and so both to Prophecy, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the <hi>Syriak</hi> Translation hath it, <hi>fidei suae,</hi> of his own Faith; and then the meaning is not according only to the measure of his gift, more or less, for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> respects quality rather than quantity; a likeness, a suitableness, and proportion therein, according to the kind of his gifts, so as the meaning is, that all his Sermons and Prophecying, should be Analogical to his Gifts and Office. As he hath Gifts and an Office of Exhortation, so let him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly frame his Sermons suitably: As we say of words (when proper) they are according to the Analogy of a Tongue; so here his Ministry is according to the Analogy of his gifts, when suitable thereunto. A day of Thanksgiving and Humiliation differs tho' there is no pre-eminence of Holiness in the one afore the other, only some Duties do <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere</hi> in the one, more than in the other; as Humiliation in the one, and Thanksgiving in the other. And therefore as a Man may in a day of Thanksgiving think of his sins, in order to raise up his Heart to thankfullness; and in a day of Humiliation, mentions God's Mercies to break his Heart for his sins: Yet so, as the eminent Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be Thanksgiving in the one, and Humiliation in the other; so it is here in the Administration of your gifts.</p>
                  <p>Neither 2. Is it that there are any Holy things that a <hi>Pastor</hi> may Administer, that not a Teacher, as to instance in the Sacraments, wherein the difference must lie, if in any thing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Sacraments are committed promiscuously to the Apostles and their Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, in teaching <hi>ex officio, Matth.</hi> 28. 19. Go and teach and Baptize.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Both are alike Stewards of the Ministries of God, which Elders are not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Both may bless and do, as in praying afore Sermons, so in Preaching the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and it is called the fullness of the Blessing of the Gospel, which a teacher in teaching brings, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 16.) as well as the Sacrament is called the Cup of blessing.</p>
                  <p>And 4. Though the Sacraments are the Seals of the Covenant that apply Christ, and so might seem peculiar to the Pastor's Office: Yet they are signs also for Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and belong therefore to the Teachers to Administer. As therefore such truths as are mixt, belong to them both to Preach, so the Administration of the Sacraments too. For they shew forth Christ's Death till he come, as well as the word, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2.) And they Preach to the Eye, that which the Gospel doth to the Ear.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Teaching is a higher Ordinance than the Sacrament, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7.) I was not sent to Preach, but Baptize: Therefore he that <hi>ex officio,</hi> doth the greater and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, may perform the lesser.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are equal in respect of Honour due to them, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17) where his Scope is to give every Office its due Honour. Therefore of Widdows, and so of Deacons, who are of the same Rank, he had said, Honour them who are Widows indeed. Of <hi>Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> a Superior Office, he hath doubled it, appointing double Honour to him that Rules well. But to those that labour in the Word (of Wisdom or Exhortation) the <hi>Pastor;</hi> or in Doctrine, the <hi>Teacher</hi> he especially assigns double Honour, and to both the same, whereas if
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:154381:145"/> the Pastor had been so Superior, (his Scope being to shew, what Honour was due to each, according to their Administration) he would have said, give to your Pastor more especial Honour of all the rest. He doth not intend any precedency, for he promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Ranks the one afore the other, and <hi>è contra,</hi> sometimes the one, sometimes the other, as <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4. 12.) <hi>Pastors</hi> afore <hi>Teachers,</hi> so here <hi>Teachers</hi> afore <hi>Pastors;</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Teacher</hi> for to express both, and that more ordinarily than the other, as <hi>(Gal.</hi> 6. 6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.) Nor doth he mean that there is an excellency in the Ministries of one above the other, that as all Ordinances excell other in something, so it is here: for when all is in order, both come to one. The one is the Tutor of the un, derstanding, the other of the Will: These are their two Pupils committed to them: And when that controversy in Philosophy is decided, which is Noblest of those two Faculties? Then may this of these two Offices.</p>
                  <p>But they differ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In respect of an eminency of Gift, inclining one way rather than another. It is said of all Prophecying Elders, (1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 9.) that they are to be able both to exhort and convince Gain-sayers by sound Doctrine, so as the <hi>Pastor</hi> is to use a word of Doctrine, and so a Teacher a word of Exhortation, but that which is <hi>eminere,</hi> or <hi>to shine forth</hi> in their Preachings, is their special gift. It is not to be thought that a <hi>Pastor</hi> is to speak only in a way of Application and Use; for he should have a Doctrine as a ground to plant his great Ordinance upon, which he dischargeth. Nor is it that the <hi>Teacher</hi> is to leave his Doctrines altogether without Application; but that his gift is suited to his office, and so his Labour is to be most spent in Doctrine, and so the words of the Text are to be understood, Let him that Teacheth, be as in Teaching, that is, most employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They differ but <hi>modaliter,</hi> in the manner of handling their Ministry. The one turns all his Sermons into Application, by way of Comfort and Exhortation; the other endeavours to inform the Judgment; they differ but as Logick and Rhetorick, which are compared to a shut hand, and one opened, the same Arguments are used in both; but the one so ordered, as to convince the Judgment, the other so as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the affection.</p>
                  <p>More particularly they differ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the several Subjects they are to deal with, both look to the inward Man; so they differ from the Elders who look to the outward: but those share the two Noble Faculties between them. The one the Understanding, the other the Will and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. The one hath more peculiarly the understanding to deal with, the other, the Will and Affections: These are their Pupils committed to their charge, Men are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and apt to err, and need to be built up in Knowledge. This the <hi>Teacher</hi> takes care of, to feed with knowledge and understanding, (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 16. and 23. 3, 4 and 6. <hi>ch.</hi> 8.) And Men are slow of Heart to do, and need quickning and stirring up: For this the Pastor's office serves, <hi>(Eccl.</hi> 12. 11.) there is need of Nails to Rivet and fasten Truths on their understanding, and establish them in them; and there is need of Goads to provoke them unto good works, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 10. 23.) And there are feeble Arms and hands that hang down, that are to be strengthned; inward evils, discouragements which are to be removed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which to do is the Pastor's office.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They differ in the object matter. The one speaks words of knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders truths, and shews the story and harmony of them, teacheth in Faith and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 7. or as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 20.) is an Instructer of the Foolish, a Teacher of Babes, and has a Form of Knowledge, and of the Truth in the Law: The other is to consider Men, and speak words of Wisdom pertinently to them. The one hath the Bible, and the System or Form of wholsom words for his Text: The other studies Men more, and seeks to fit the word to them. And the Pastor is one able to discern what is peculiarly fit for Men's Spirits, and so speaks wisely to Men, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speaks pertinently to truths. The one brings Scripture to Scripture, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares each with each; the other deals and divides the word, and brings Scripture and Men's Consciences together. You may discern this difference in Men's Conferences; some when they speak, consider the occasion of the party: Some follow still the occasion the discourse giveth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They differ in respect of truths, the <hi>Pastor</hi> deals with points of practice more, with things to be done; the other with points of Faith, with things to be believed.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:154381:145"/> Some truths are mixt, and in those both are alike to deal, as in cases of Conscience, and scruples of Conscience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To express it by the method of Preaching in use with us, whereas Sermons consist of Doctrines and uses, so the gifts of the one lies more in explaining the words and phrases, and to bring Reasons to confirm and to solve doubts, and resolve miste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and so succeed these Prophets under the New Testament, who opened harder places and difficulties. The other is more fit to enlarge into uses, and to digest all truths into practical thoughts, which with power he can set home on the Heart.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Pastor</hi> deals with Mens sins more, the <hi>Teacher</hi> with Mens Errors more; the one in Information, the other in Mortification. The one hath more of Christ's Priestly Office in slaying the Old Man, and offering up Believers as a Sacrifice to Christ, <hi>(Rom</hi> 15. 16.) the other hath Christ's Prophetical Office more imported, in opening truths, as the <hi>Elder</hi> hath more of Christ's Kingly Office, in Ruling over Mens Consciences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 1. See the goodness of God, who hath made such abundant provision for all defects; as he hath fitted gifts to Offices, so both to the needs of Men, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 21.) which implies, that God, in placing the Members, respected the need of the whole, as <hi>Natura non deficit in necessariis neque gratia.</hi> Look what the inward Man wants, preaching Officers are to provide for, and all the several parts of it; and what is defective in the outward Man, the Elders are to watch over. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we see, as Ministers are thus eminently gifted, so people are eminently fitted to them: Some are quickened more by an affectionate way, and cleave to such a Ministry; some by a Doctrinal way, and are built up by Notions and Knowledge, that so all tasts may be suited, and all have their portion.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Ʋse,</hi> There is a Rule for Churches in their choice, to Rank Men into offices, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their gifts. This you are to heed, for you chuse not for your selves, but for the Lord (as he said, you Judge for the Lord.) The Apostle says, <hi>(Acts</hi> 14. 23.) the Holy Ghost made them Over-seers; yet they were called by Men, &amp; set over his Church purchased by his Blood, over a Flock which God accounts so precious. You are not therefore to chuse, out of any ends of common prudence, but for Spiritual ends, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comparing Spiritual things with Spiritual, to suit Men and places accordingly: There is Simony in by ends. In other choises they use to give Oaths, as in Colledges, and in Corporations, but here there is none but conscience to be a tye upon you.</p>
                  <p>That which now remains, is to establish the truth of these several Offices here mentioned, because it is denyed by many (as you know) that there are such, or so many differing officers to be in Churches, denying that there is such a difference between the office of <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Teacher,</hi> and that under those two <hi>Names,</hi> one only kind of officer is meant, in respect of a differing action to be performed by him, and so that there are several Works, not Persons: And then again wholly taking away the office of the Ruling Elder, as neither necessary, nor any way the Institution of Christ.</p>
                  <p>I will First therefore, in general, argue out of this place, of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. 8.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That in this place officers and not actions or duties of Members are spoken of▪ is evident, 1. In that he mentions, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <hi>Ministry,</hi> which is a name of an office, not of an action of any private Member.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that he says, <hi>He that Ruleth,</hi> it must needs note out an Office; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, one Brother is not to Rule over another, or to take upon him to do it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that he speaks of them, as of such callings as Men are to exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in. which is proper for Officers so to do. Now so he speaks of them; for that he calls for diligence of a Ruler, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which, as <hi>Boetius</hi> defines it, is <hi>Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens animi intentio ad id quod suscipitur; a Vehement intention of Mind, to that which is undertaken:</hi> So as to mind it, and employ one's self in it, as in a Calling and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment designed there, which also that Phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, implies: <hi>He that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth in Ministring, that Teacheth on Teaching;</hi> that Phrase, <hi>to be in,</hi> notes out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it one's calling; for so, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15, 16.) speaking to <hi>Timothy</hi> to perform the work of an <hi>Evangelist;</hi> he says, give thy self wholy to them, and be in them, <hi>v.</hi> 16. as the word is in the Original, and in that also he useth such participles to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, as Exhortations, <hi>In docendo, in exhortando,</hi> it implies a Calling, and not an Action, for otherwise it were a Tautology: For if he meant an Action only, then to say, <hi>He</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:154381:146"/>
                     <hi>that Teacheth, Teach,</hi> were a Tautology: So as the one notes out <hi>Jus &amp; nomen officij,</hi> the other, the exercise of his Office: To say, let him that seeth, see, is a Tautology. But to say, let the seer see, he whose Office it is; is to call upon him to do his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by reason of his Office, so as the one, <hi>he that Teacheth,</hi> notes out, <hi>Jus &amp; poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> the other, <hi>in Teaching,</hi> notes <hi>praxin,</hi> the exercise of it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Those who oppose this Congregational way, have none to teach or exhort, but those that are in Office, or Orders, as they call it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though he call them Gifts, yet so Officers are called, <hi>(Ephes.</hi> 4. 3.) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles office he calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I say, says he, through the grace given me; that is, my Apostolical power and office, as was shewed afore.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Ordinary officers are meant.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the Gifts and Actions he speaks of are ordinary, such as no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts are required for the performance of: As to teach or exhort, to give, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Actions and Gifts remain still in the Church.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Because even the Prophets here (which if any, might seem extraordinary) are limited to the Analogy of Faith; and all exhorted not to entrench upon other's Callings or Actions, which bounds, if they had been extraordinary Officers, they could not have set to them.</p>
                  <p>Now then 3. If officers, and officers ordinary, be here meant, then look how many several Enumerations there are, so many several offices are there too. For else,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Scope of his former General Exhortation, that they should not entrench up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another's Functions, had been made utterly void, if several offices and actions had not been intended.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Because he had spoken of diversity, <hi>ver.</hi> 4 6. therefore these Enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must be understood as instances of that diversity.</p>
                  <p>And 4 If Pastors and Deacons are differing, then, why not all: There is the same reason for the one, as for the other. And therefore, why should not he that teacheth, be differing from him that exhorteth; as well as from him that giveth or Ruleth. And in that, <hi>(Ephes.</hi> 4.) <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Doctor,</hi> and (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) teachers and helpers and Governours, are reckoned up amongst the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary: It argues, that in an ordinary way there is the like necessity of them, that in an extraordinary there was of the other. I shall speak more particularly of the difference and distinction of the offices of <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Teacher.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It appears that these offices are distinct in that place, <hi>(Ephes.</hi> 4. 11.) we find <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> enumerated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> Against this place is objected, that it is spoken exegetically, <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> as making up all one office.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But then he would have said rather <hi>Pastors</hi> or <hi>Teachers,</hi> not <hi>and</hi> Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, doth not always lock together, but sometimes differenceth two things it is set betwixt, as in the like case, <hi>(Acts</hi> 13 1.) Prophets <hi>and</hi> Teachers: By Prophets he means, in the Language of the primitive times, extraordinary Gifts, but teachers were ordinary: And <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> who were extraordinary Men, are there reckoned.</p>
                  <p>And 3. In all Exegetical Speeches, the latter explains the former, and useth to be more clear; but after <hi>Pastors</hi> in that Sense that's held (this being the proper name of the office) to say, i. e. <hi>Teachers</hi> is to explain the more proper by the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But to all the rest, there is a note of difference affixed, as when he says, some <hi>Apostles,</hi> some <hi>Evangelists,</hi> but of these <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>Tecahers</hi> there is none, so as it seems, they were intended as one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> But it is the manner of the <hi>Grecians</hi> to bring in the word [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>and]</hi> in the end of a disjunctive Enumeration, in a disjunctive Sense, as in that, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 3. 21.) after he had said, there is neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Greek,</hi> neither bound nor free, he ends that last disjunction, neither <hi>Male</hi> or <hi>Female;</hi> in Greek it is, neither <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> so in the Original, and the <hi>Syriak</hi> so reads it.</p>
                  <p>And 2. As their offices are thus here, and in that place thus distinct; so their gifts also are distinct: And this is a Rule infallible, that according to diversity of gifts hath God appointed diversity of offices: He suited gifts and offices together, so
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:154381:146"/> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 45. There are diversities of Gifts, and diversities of Administrations, so as they are commensurable; now in the same place, when <hi>(ver.</hi> 8.) He enumerates the variety of Gifts: To one, says he, is given the word of Wisdom, to another the word of Knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He speaks of Preachers that speak the word, which differenceth them from El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for he calls it a word of Knowledge, and a word of Wisdom.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He speaks of ordinary Officers, for as <hi>Beza</hi> observes, when he begins to speak of extraordinary Gifts, in the next word he varies the Phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. And they differ, as <hi>prudentia &amp; scientia</hi> in Philosophy many Men knowing things in the notion, that are not so wise to discern of Men and things, and to apply accordingly. And according to what the Holy Ghost hath said here of the variety of Men's Gifts, we find nothing more evident in experience, even in a Church, where there is a confusion of Offices: Yet God still kept to his Rule, and distributed Gifts according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Some apt to open things more largely, others to apply them; yea, the Papists did observe this difference of Gifts, as is evident in their comparing <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Bonaventure</hi> together: <hi>Thomas intellectu eminuit,</hi> Bonaventura <hi>affectu splenduit:</hi> The one was a more understanding Judicious Divine, the other more Affectionate and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to stir up affection: And even in the Natural parts of Men, there is that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, some are fit positively to explain and convince, but cannot perswade; others are more fit to perswade and prevail with Men. And thereby do ordinary Officers differ from those extraordinary, that both meet in these: (So in <hi>Timothy)</hi> but are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in those other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As there are differing Gifts, so differing Works, to a differing end. Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Elders are distinguished from Ruling, by labouring in the Word and Doctrine, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.) for the great labour is that of the Mind. By <hi>word,</hi> some Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand a word of Exhortation, as here distinct from Doctrine or Teaching. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>suffer the word of Exhortation, and</hi> Acts 13. 15. <hi>If any have a word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, &amp;c.</hi> And Doctrine, on the contrary, is taken for the form of truth and wholsom words, which is taught especially by the teacher, as (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26.) Doctrine is taken. And as here they are called both Prophets, so according to those ends of Prophecying mentioned, (as 14. 3.) may their distinction here be illustrated. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying he says is a speaking to Edification, to Exhortation, to Comfort; if Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be taken in a strict Sense as distinct from comfort and exhortation (though I confess elsewhere, and in the next Verses, it is taken largely) then it notes out Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in knowledge, which is the Teachers work, and Exhortation and Comfort the Pastor's: The Teacher Prophecyeth to Edification, and the Exhorter, to Exhortation and Comfort. And therefore it is observable that the word used here, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is either to Comfort or to Exhort.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By this distribution of Officers, there is a Communication of all the Offices of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Pastor</hi> Represents the Priestly Office of Christ. For he by the word ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. slays the Old Man, and presents the New Creature to God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Teacher Represents the Prophetical Office of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Kingly Office of Christ, is more eminently seen in the Ruling Elder.</p>

This suits with all the needs of a Church, their understandings are the <hi>Teacher's</hi> Pupils, their <hi>Wills,</hi> the <hi>Pastor's,</hi> their <hi>Lives,</hi> the charge of the <hi>Elders:</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we see Believers Appeal some to Doctrinal Preaching, some to Exhortation. And thus Ranked were the Ministers in the Primitive times: There were two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying Elders (at lest) in a Church, <hi>(Col.</hi> 4. 18.) <hi>Archippus</hi> had a Ministry he was to fulfill, and that surely a Teaching one; for their other Minister <hi>Epaphras,</hi> who was also their Minister, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 1. was then absent, <hi>Col.</hi> 4 12. more besides they might have, and a Church may have, (as <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1:) they had many teachers in one Church, and as <hi>Musculus</hi> observes, on <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. he says, all have not the same Office, not that <hi>none</hi> have the same. The Body to which the comparison is, hath two Eyes, two Hands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there was something in it, that Christ in sending forth the Apostles, sent them two by two.

                  <p> The <hi>German</hi> Divines make this Office proper to Universities, and professors there, but the Apostle makes the Officer a Member of the Church, and for all Saints, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.

                  <argument>
                     <p>That a Pastor and Teacher, and many other Officers of a particular Church, have the promise of a special Blessing from God. That accordingly they do receive such a special Blessing suited to the Rank, and order of their Office, to give Success in the Execution of it, beyond what a meer Preacher can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>

                     <bibl>Psal. 133. 1, 2, 3.</bibl>
                     <q>Keep not thou silence O God: Hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God. For lo, thine Enemies make a Tumult, and they that hate thee, have lift up the Head. They have taken crafty counsel against thy People, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THere is one thing which I cannot pretermit, but must urge and press it, <hi>viz.</hi> that every Institution and Office, and order appointed by God, hath answerably to accompany it, and succeed it, a special blessing suited to the nature of it. This is evident from this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 1, 2, 3. It is common to the New Testament, though spoken of the Assemblies of the Old Testament, either of the lesser Synagogues, or of the General Assemblies at their Feasts, for they were under their High Priests, to whom he does allude, ver. 2. <hi>It is like the pretious Oyntment upon the Head, that ran down upon the Beard, even</hi> Aaron's <hi>Beard, that went down to the skirts of his Garments.</hi> Every Member partook of some benefit of the Holy Oyl poured upon <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Head, the chief Officer of those General Assemblies; and it is expresly added of them there, that God commands the Blessing. And this, though an Old Testament instance, may fitly serve for the New, <hi>mutatis mutandis.</hi> For a particular Church, where the Brethren meet in one <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, with one consent, one heart, one worship, is in it self alone a distinct special Ordinance and Institution of Christ, and he hath promised that <hi>where two or three are gathered together in his Name, he will be in the midst amongst them, Matth.</hi> 18. 20. And his presence brings all sorts of blessings with it, and there 'tis that God commands a blessing. For that company are the House of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. The Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the Truth. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the Seat of Truth, a Pillar of Truth, not <hi>Architectonically,</hi> that supported the Truth, but <hi>Phorendically</hi> as pillars use to be, with papers pasted on them to declare the Truth. It is an Ordinance to preserve Truth in the World, to hold it forth, as on pillars they used to place their Writings. God is used to bless the small despised Assemblies of Saints gathered together in unity, more then great Councils consisting of Popes and Bishops, and Cardinals. These small Assemblies have been the little creepers in the Chimney, that keep up the fires, which the great Andirons, do not as was Prince <hi>Henry</hi>'s Speech. And a Church, though very small, is yet a Church of the Living God, and (as Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> once well said) A Church is a thing, that lives, because it has the Living God to dwell in it.</p>
                  <p>And as God blesseth the Churches that are the Casket, the Sheath, so he blesseth their Officers too that are proper to them (though among Men accounted the lowest) that is, they are Pastors and Teachers in particular Congregations, who are their Preaching Elders.</p>
                  <p>The Papists plead that it is their Church that keep the Faith and the Truth, and that God had made a promise to lead them into all Truth. But it is the ordinary Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Church, Pastors and Teachers, which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> says do build up the Church, <hi>till they come to the unity of the Faith, Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. And it is among you he has commanded the blessing, which is demonstrated thus, that Christ when he ascended, gave Gifts unto Men, and scattered them among the Saints, <hi>tanquam mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silia,</hi>
                     <pb n="291" facs="tcp:154381:147"/> As the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors did their Donatives among the People, as their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots went along. Now what were those Gifts, but the Offices which God Instituted in the Church Universal; First the extraordinary, that ceased before <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time, as Apostles, Prophets, Evangelist's, and there are no more of them to be found on Earth, only their Writings continue, and make up the New Testament. But who are the lasting Officers of continuance to preserve the Truths, when they were gone, none but Pastors and Teachers, and unto these it has been, that the Faith hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and by them preserved, and Truth hath been taught, and how long do they last? Till all come to the unity of the Faith of the Son of God: If any point of Faith be erred in, that is not Fundamental; these Pastors and Teachers do restore it unto its primitive Native Splendour. 'Tis there God appoints the Blessing, what ever Men pretend of General Councils; and the reason is, because God still follows his own Institutions with his own Blessing, and there God commands a Blessing. As Christ himself did ascend from the lower parts of the Earth unto that hight, which he has in Heaven, so dothall Truths arise from the lower sort of Ministers; and if Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils have any Truth among them, it is because it hath ascended first unto unto them, from the inferior lower sort of Ministers, as they in Debasement call them.</p>
                  <p>That in general, a special blessing from God is promised to all Assemblies and Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, whether of the Old or New Testament is evinced from this one place which I have mentioned, <hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 1, 2, 3. where a blessing is so emphatically declared, <hi>There God commands a blessing,</hi> which denotes the intention of God's mind in it. Now to whom and to what is this Superexcellent blessing even eternal life, which is the sum and quintessence of blessings commanded to be bestowed? Under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the promise of Eternal Life was then given, Witness, that one Scripture speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Old Testament worship by the twelve Tribes, <hi>to which promise</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>the twelve Tribes,</hi> meaning the Nation of the Godly <hi>Jews, hoping to come; served God Day and Night.</hi> Their Assemblies were either the General Assemblies or Feasts, at which the High Priest, the greatest Officer of the Old Testament, and the Type of Christ was present, or else the lesser Assemblies of the Synagogues, and all the Order and Institutions belonging to them, and all this blessing was promised to each and every of them. And their Holy Communion together in the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, the <hi>Psalmist</hi> compares unto the pouring down the Holy Oyl upon the Head of the High Priest, and as the Oyl dropt down upon all his Garments, the Skirts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So every particular Member <hi>likewise they exhorted to keep the unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace.</hi> These are the unities of the New Testament, that the Saints are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to live in also, and above all to avoid divisions, they are called to peace in one Body, and every particular Church is called the House of the living God, dwelling together with them to keep them in unity. And Christ's first Institution of a particular Church under the New Testament expresses it on this wise again: I say unto you, that if two of you shall agree upon Earth, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 18. 19. There is unity, and as touching any thing they shall ask of my Father which is in Heaven (says Christ) it shall be done unto them; and then adds the words of Institution, <hi>For where two or three are gathered together in my Name, I am in the midst of them.</hi> They therefore who are present, receive a participation of the blessings promised, of some of the Holy Oyl poured upon Christ the Head.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, This Scripture though written under the Old Testament, is yet, <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis Mutandis,</hi> readily Aplicable to the New constituted Assemblies of the Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, constituted Assemblies of the Saints un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, and even the Terms and the Language used in the <hi>Psalm</hi> is fitted to those of the New Testament. As for instance, the word <hi>Brethren dwelling together,</hi> is the proper cognizance of the community of the Saints Assembled under the New. Those words [dwelling together in unity] is well nigh the same: For they dwell in Churches under Pastors and Teachers, and are instructed till they all come to <hi>the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith</hi> and Knowledge of the Son of God. And where Christ's presence is, there is always a blessing; and 'tis also a description of a New Testament Church, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23.) That 'tis a whole Church, consisting of all its Members <hi>met together in one place.</hi> There is unity of place. And then, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 14. we have an account that they met with one consent, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) to perform the Duties of Worship. And whoever will read the story of the first New Testament Church that God reared in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> will find abundantly enough in the story of the first Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:154381:148"/> and in the second Chapter concerning their continuing together in one place, <hi>they were all with one accord in one place, (Chap.</hi> 2. 1.) and there was fullfilled the Prophecies of <hi>Joel,</hi> in pouring out the Spirit of God upon them, which inwardly united them together, and Jesus Christ his presence was amongst them, and he being by the Right Hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost was in the midst of them: And he being the High Priest of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 3. 1.) God hath anointed him, of which anointing we have all participated, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. nor did they only continue together in the Apostles Fellowship in the Temple, and in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Porch, in Preaching, in Prayers, and in breaking Bread (as in those Chapters is mentioned) but it grew to such a unity, that <hi>the multitude of them that believed, were of one Heart and of one Soul, neither said any one that ought of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things common, and with great power gave the Apostle witnesse of the Resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all, Acts</hi> 4. 32, 33. For that time they keep as a day of Thanksgiving, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual feasting unto the Lord for the Joy they had, that their New King was alive and risen. So as those other words of the <hi>Psalmist,-Behold how good and how pleasant a thing it is, for Brethren to dwell together in unity,</hi> were then verified in such a manner, and with such a joy, as had never been seen afore in the World at any time. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as the common <hi>Jews</hi> that were not Believers, nor of their company beheld and magnified them <hi>praising God, and having favour with all the People,</hi> Acts 2. 47. <hi>Ecce quam invicem diligunt, Behold how they love one another,</hi> was the common cry of the Multitude, thus plausibly and happily did this Church begin, and <hi>great grace was upon them all, Acts</hi> 3. 33. they were joyned or glued together, as the word is. And thus blessed from God, was the first Seat and Pillar of Truth not Architectonical, or a pillar that bore up the Truth, but Phoreneical whereby according to the custom of those times, the Holy Mysteries of God and Christ, were posted to be seen and read of all, and thus much in general to prove that there is a blessing from God in a Gospel Church, truly gathered and constituted by God where Christ is present.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And if the case, the Sheath, the Cabinet be thus precious to God; then the Gifts which God places in his Cabinet, I mean the Instituted Officers of this Church, which are the Furniture and Ornament of it, are also precious unto God, and ought to be unto us; and that which I insist on, is that each of them have a special blessing from God to accompany them as a Gift from God, and special blessing. And indeed the Officers duly placed and fixed in this Seat of Truth, have been in all Ages since Christ the great Preservers and Restorers of Gospel Truth, and to whom we owe the Glorious Reformation of our Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Papists make a great plea of the Churches Infallibility and Authority through God's blessing, as they pretend, but when we come to examine what that Church is, that is, the preserver of Truth, they cry up the Higher Clergy (as they call it) of Popes, Patriarks, Bishops, and such like Doctors of the Higher Rank. But it is reported to have been Prince <hi>Henry</hi>'s Speech and Similitude (Eldest Son to King <hi>James</hi> the first) that being invited to a Merchants House, where a great pair of brass And<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irons were; these gaudy appearances of shining brass (says he) are not the pillars that hold up the fire, as your Bishops and Doctors are not, but they are the little creepers of Iron, which bear up the fire: So it is not your Prelates which uphold the Church, but it is your inferior Ministers which take pains in their places that uphold it, and not General Councils, nor the Dignified Clergy. In <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12. it is said of Pastors and Teachers, that they are the only standing Officers of the Church, whom Jesus Christ hath continued in the Ministry, for the edifying the Body of Christ through every Age, which their Succession does run through, till we all come in the Unity of Faith and Knowledge of the Son of God, every such Age by the instructions of these ordinary Ministers preserving the knowledge of Christ, and unity of Faith, Now what is the reason that the People of God should be built up by these means, rather then by pompous Ostentation of Knowledge, but only because indeed God's blessing follows his own Ordination; and Apostles and Evangelists being ceased and gone of the Stage, and only their Writings in the New Testament left, God produces an oral propagating down of these Truths among his Elect, by these ordinary Pastors.</p>
                  <p>And these and the like blessings, Jesus Christ hath freely bestowed as special Gifts and Donatives of Grace, so as the Gift of them is in it self a singular blessing to any People that enjoys them, and besides God follows the Person with a special blessing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:154381:148"/> and endowment, together with his Gift and Ability, according to the Rank and Order of the Office it self, which is also the gift in that, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. before quoted. He rehearseth all sorts of instituted Officers in the Church, whether ordinary or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, as for Preaching the extraordinary, ver. 11. <hi>He gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists;</hi> These are the twelve Stars about the Church's Head, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 1. wherewith the first Primitive Age was crowned; but they have ever since disappeared, only leaving their Writings, and they ceasing in respect of living, the Christian World began anew, were Children rather then Fathers, there being few Preaching Elders that had Gifts of ability, as may be discerned by their Writings they have left: But the ordinary standing Ministers were Pastors and Teachers, and to them Christ committed the institution of the Church. Now concerning them you may observe two things for our present purpose.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were special gifts of Jesus Christ, and superadded graces out of grace were bestowed on Men, and such as might somewhat exceed the common sort of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, being first instructed from the extraordinary, 2 Tim. 2. 2. <hi>And the things thou hast heard of me before many Witnesses, the same commit thou to Faithful Men, who shall be able to teach others also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ having all power committed unto him in Heaven and Earth, appointed two distinct Offices of Preaching Elders, investing them with his Authority, and in his name, suitably.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He, by special Solemnities of his appointment, set and separated them to those Offices with Fasting and Prayer.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He gave a special blessing to each office and officer, in the execution of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for the People's sake over whom he is placed.</p>
                  <p>And when he had made up and compounded an Office and Officer, with all these particulars, he then gave them, as a Gift and Donative of meer grace, and has scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them as <hi>Missilia</hi> among the People, according to his good pleasure. I call them so, alluding to the name which the <hi>Romans</hi> gave to the pieces of Gold and Silver which their Emperors ordered to be cast amongst the People. This our Lord Jesus doth from Heaven himself, withal blessing them; for our Lord and Saviour Christ, when he was to ascend to Heaven, in the sight of the five Hundred that were present, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 6.) he then singled out his Apostles and other Ministers, whom he had appointed in his Life-time, and had sent them two and two, Matth. 28. 18, 19, 20. <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and on Earth,</hi> and upon that he founds their Commissions; <hi>Go ye therefore and Teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.</hi> For that was spoken only of Ministers, <hi>Go and Baptize, &amp;c.</hi> which was only proper for Ministers, who are the only Stewards of the Ministries of God, and so of Baptism being a Sacrament and Seal of the Covenant. And Christ also adds this for them, <hi>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you always even to the end of the World,</hi> Amen. And when he had given them this Authority and Gifts to Teach all Nations, he promises to be with them to the end of the World, and the last thing he did was to bless them, Luke 24. ver. 50, 51. <hi>And he lift up his Hands and Blessed them; and it came to pass, whilst he Blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into Heaven.</hi> And this he did in Analogy to what God did in the first Creation, when he had made the first Man and Woman, Gen. 1. 28. <hi>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitfull and multiply.</hi> And thus Christ did in his New Creation of Ministers, whether extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as in the first times, or ordinary, which are to endure to the end of the World; and upon all inferior or lower Ministers, and on all Officers of his Church, to come; in their several degrees he commands the blessing, which still continues, and we Act, and are Acted in the vertue of it.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have proved, that Jesus Christ hath himself solemnly blessed these Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Offices of Preaching Ministers, and that he did it just as he was going to Heaven:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I shall now Demonstrate more expresly, that every Ministerial Office hath a blessing to accompany it, according to its Order and Institution, which will yet more confirm, that these two particular Offices we have instanced, of Pastor and Teacher, have certainly the blessing commanded to them, for if every Officer else hath it, then much more these which are very Noble, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 15. 29.) in their employment and usefulness to Man. If we want this compleatness we shall find we shall fall so much
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:154381:149"/> short of the Blessing; but the Apostle says, that he came to the <hi>Romans</hi> in the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the blessing of the Gospel, so we are to take care that we do not miss of some degree of that blessing, which the fullness of the Institution will bring with it.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to Demonstrate this Truth by a view of particular Offices which God has Instituted, and with them each hath appointed a particular blessing or benefit, or issue, and event thereof.</p>
                  <p>As for the Old Testament, I will give but one instance, (but to me it is a great one) to evidence the thing in hand, Levit. 9. 23. <hi>And</hi> Moses <hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and came out, and blessed the People, and the Glory of the Lord appeared unto all the People.</hi> Yea, when the ordinary Levites and Priests blessed the People, their Voice was heard, 2 Chron. 30. 27. <hi>Then the Priests and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites arose and blessed the People, and their Voice was heard, and their Prayer came up to his Holy dwelling place, even unto Heaven.</hi> And as it had its effect in the Heart of God, so the blessing of the High Priest had a strange and miraculous effect in the Heart of a poor Woman. How much was poor <hi>Hannahs</hi> Heart loaded, and made unquiet by her fellow-partner <hi>Peninnah, Elhanah's</hi> other Wife? the story doth pittifully and mournfully set it out, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 6. And her Adversary provoked her sore for to make her fret, and then poor <hi>Hannah, (ver.</hi> 10:) was in bitterness of Soul, and prayed unto the Lord and wept sore; but when <hi>Eli</hi> blessed her (say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (ver. 17.) <hi>Go in peace, and the Lord God of</hi> Israel <hi>grant thee thy Petition, that thou hast asked of him, ver.</hi> 18.) then the Woman went her way, and her countenance was no more sad.</p>
                  <p>In the New Testament (if we examine from the lowest Office of the Church to the highest) there is a peculiar blessing promised according to its Degree, Rank or Order of the Institution.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Deacon is esteemed the lowest Office, but the discharging of it well hath a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial incouragement, in comparison of what other common Christians have, 1 Tim. 3. 13. <hi>For they that have used the Office of a Deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the Faith that is in Christ Jesus.</hi> A good degree, that is, they obtain, as a reward to themselves, an Estimation above the Rank of ordinary Believers in the Faith, and great boldness thereupon. And in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. Likewise the Women <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>viz. Deaconesses</hi> (so <hi>Grotius</hi> renders it, and not Wives) who were to tend the Sick, must be Grave, Sober, Faithful in all things, and Christ will be faithful to them to Reward them according to their deservings. Thus it is in the lowest Offices in the Church: If we ascend to the highest, which was the order of Apostles in the Church, there were several things concurred in an Apostle, as to have been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant with Christ during the time of his walking upon Earth, and then to have been eye-witnesses of his Resurrection after his Death, but the principal eminent thing that had the blessing to convert Souls whereever they came, and had the great success in that their Ministry, was, by vertue of the very office it self. For when our Saviour Christ sent out his Twelve Apostles, he furnished them with two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With the matter which they should Preach. They were directed to Preach the Kingdom of God, and so to work upon Mens Souls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Christ furnished them with Authority and Power extraordinary, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 10. 1.) to Heal the Sick, cleanse the Leper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this is my assertion, that it twas not only the Gift of Ability to Preach, but the Authority and Power which they were invested with, wherein lay their Apostleship and their universal commission to go over all, or to any Nation, and Preach the Gospel with Success. In the vertue of this Office it was, that the blessing did accompany them where-ever they went, and from thence it was, that God wrought so with them as he did. It was by vertue of the Office it self which he had placed them in, and invironed them about with the power of God. What says <hi>Paul, (Gal.</hi> 2. 6, 7.) concerning his own and <hi>Peter's</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postleship? That when they saw, by different experiences, and by conference of us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the various working of God in the Ministry by me and by them, they knew that the Gospel of uncircumcision was committed to me, as the Gospel of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was to <hi>Peter.</hi> Now this arose not from the different Abilities of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> but from the various Commission and Success that their Office and Apostleship had in it from God: It was not that <hi>Paul</hi> was more abundantly laborious in the Ministry then
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:154381:149"/> them all. That his Gospel ran like Wildfire upon seared Trees in a torrid Zone, Rom. <hi>c.</hi> 15. ver. 19. <hi>Through mighty Signs and Wonders by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and round about to</hi> Illyricum (that is all along as far as <hi>Hungary) I have fully preached the Gospel.</hi> And it was not the knowledge of his own Ability he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed on; but the Authority God had put him into by his Office, and he, in a Holy kind of Ambition in doing this, scorned to build upon another's Foundation, as in ver. 20. <hi>Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was named, least I should build upon another Man's Foundation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it was chiefly the conscience of that Office of Apostleship which God had placed him in, and that Success to an Admiration that God accompanyed him with, which did thrust out that Holy Beast of his, 1 Cor. 15. 10. <hi>But I laboured more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly then they all, yet not I, but the Grace of God that was with me.</hi> And this I boldly interpret, that he speaks it not of the Grace of God that was in himself, but of the Grace of God that was with him, and so speaks of his Office which God had put him into, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>For I am the least of the Apostles, that am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of Christ. But by the Grace of God, I am what I am.</hi> He speaks not of the Grace he received at his conversion to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, but of that of his Apostleship, which I speak not to provoke to pains, that is unreasonable, but to shew that the Success ever he had from God in it, provoked him unto it. It was not the Grace of his conversion he thanked God for, but that of his Apostleship, as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> 12. to 18. <hi>I was a persecutor and a blasphemer, and yet he put me into the Ministry, &amp;c.</hi> He seems to thank God for that, in the first and chief place, and Rom. 11. 13. <hi>For I speak to you</hi> Gentiles, <hi>in as much as I am an Apostle of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>I magnifie mine Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the way, Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> in his Ecclesiastical policy, has a controversy with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops about this, <hi>viz.</hi> to which of Christ's Offices Ministers owe their Original for the Ministry. They say they hold it from him as Priest, chiefly for their Honour, but the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> Attributes it to his being King. He is the great Soveraign that works all things, and does all things, and yet he is invisible, which is his glory, and so Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ founds it on his Kingly Office; <hi>All power in Heaven and on Earth is given to me,</hi> (says he) and so go and Teach all Nations, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. But here, the wonder may be, that the priviledge of being put into the Ministry, should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him <hi>Grace,</hi> but the Apostle has prevented us in our wonder at it, in Rom. 1. 5. <hi>By whom we have received Grace and Apostleship for obedience to the Faith among all Nations, for his Name.</hi> Which he accordingly urges them unto, upon every occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>according as we have received Grace</hi> (says he) <hi>we exhort you,</hi> &amp;c. Now, would you think it, he stiles every standing Office in the Church a Grace, or the Grace of God, in like manner as he had done the Apostleship, Eph. 3. 7. <hi>Whereof I was made a Minister according to the Gift of the Grace of God given unto me, by the effectual working of his power.</hi> In like manner he calls every particular Office, in the Church instituted, a Grace from God, Rom. 12. 4. 6. <hi>For as we have many Members in one Body, and all Members have not the same Office. Having Gifts differing according to the Grace that is given to us.</hi> And then he Enumerates the standing Instituted Offices as Pastor, and so downwards to the very Tenders of the Sick. <hi>He that sheweth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> (says he) <hi>let him do it with chearfulness.</hi> And as he calls these Offices Gifts, so he calls it Grace to be so called into such Offices, even as he had called the Apostleship the Gift of Grace unto himself, and so there is in their proportion the like blessing and obligation.</p>
                  <p>It is strange that all that perfect Holiness, that <hi>Adam</hi> had afore his fall, should be called the Image of God; and yet it arose not to the Dignity and Stile of being called Grace, which denotes something Supernatural above the due of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Because in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7. two standing Offices are in common named Prophecying and Teaching, in distinction from the lower Offices, I shall upon the occasion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of argue the point in hand; namely, that the two Preaching Elders being made Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and their calling being to Prophecy that they have a special blessing promised answerably to their Institution. To explain which more distinctly, we may and must know, that Prophecying in the Language of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, is used to express the Preaching of Members who are not Officers, and yet have Gifts fit to Edifie the Church, which the Apostle therefore allows, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.) but so as this kind of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:154381:150"/> was not to hinder the Church from having standing Elders of Preaching, for that other kind of exercise of Prophecying from the Members is to be voluntary, and occasional as the Spirit of God supplies them with new matter. But Jesus Christ Head of the Church, thought not fit to leave his Church to such an uncertain slender provision only. But as he is Rich in Mercy, so he would have his Word to dwell richly and plentifully in his House, and has therefore appointed Officers that should Preach, in Season, and out of Season, that should give themselves wholy up to these things, to make it their work and business to seek to find out pleasant words, as of <hi>Solomon</hi> it's said, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 10. Now our Lord Jesus Christ our Founder is a great King, and will have his Children Nobly Educated by Men, whose Office it is to tend them as Princes have; yea, he has appointed and set Tutors over every Faculty of his People, Teachers to inform their understandings, Pastors and Exhorters to deal with their Wills and Affections, and those lower than they, to take care about their Bodies for Sickness or Poverty. This is a Faithful saying, he that desires the Office of a Bishop, desireth a good Work: And of these the Apostle says, <hi>They are worthy of double Honour,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. To whom doth he speak it? But to these other men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned that are out of Office, who are to have but single Honour in comparison of those other, who are the Stars in Christ's right Hand, firm and fixed in their Orbs.</p>
                  <p>And here it will not be improper, nor impertinent to shew the procedure and degrees, but especially the outward course and means, that God took to bring the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Apostleship to this perfection and height of consummation. But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it is for us to consider the <hi>outward means</hi> and course God took therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Foundation of his Apostleship was founded upon Christ's calling him in so extraordinary a manner, who Prophecyed of him aforehand, that he was a chosen Vessel, and that he would send him as a Witness of him among the Gentiles, so at his conversion. Then for three years he lived in <hi>Arabia,</hi> during which time (as Bishop <hi>Ʋsher</hi> happily conjectures) God took an occasion to make known his whole Gospel to him, both in the Center and Circumference of all the Truths of it, and their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence one with another. And tho' God was able speedily to Reveal, yet <hi>Paul</hi> was to take all in, and that required time. Now after God had filled and furnished <hi>Paul</hi>'s Heart and Head, with all kind of matter to inable him to Preach, after this you read of his Preaching up and down to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but unknown by face to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 22. and then he went to <hi>Tarshish</hi> his own City, from whence <hi>Barnabas</hi> fetched him, and brought him to <hi>Antioch.</hi> And there it was that <hi>Paul</hi> received an outward Mission and Commission, to be an Apostle to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And it was by the ordinary course and means of laying on of Hands, with Fasting and Prayer, for him, which is an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample for our Encouragement in our being put into rhe Ministry, to receive a blessing in the use of that ordinary means. The Story is, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. The Elders of the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> being met, and having fasted, the Holy Ghost said, <hi>separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the work, whereunto I have called them: And when they bad fasted and prayed, and laid</hi> their Hands on them, <hi>they sent them away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> Writing to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Citizens of the Head City of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 1.) to the words of this Story, and to that mission of him Recorded in that Story in using the very words, as glorying in that Stile which he counted the Foundation of his Apostleship among the <hi>Gentiles. Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them,</hi> says the Holy Ghost, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. separated unto the Gospel of God (says the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1.) <hi>We have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the Faith among all Nations for his Name.</hi> And from thence in the rest of the Epistle, and in this Epistle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> he urgeth obedience to his Apostolical Authority, in such words as those, according as we have received Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> Grace of Apostleship, as he interprets it, do so and so, as we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. This is frequent too in the Epistles to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and in this to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 11. 13. <hi>For I speak to you</hi> Gentiles, <hi>in as much as I am the Apostle of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>I magnifie mine Office,</hi> Eph. 3. 3. <hi>whereof, viz.</hi> of the Gospel <hi>I was made a Minister, according to the Gift of the Grace of God given unto me, by the effectual working of his power.</hi> It was to the Authority of his Office he ascribed the Efficacy and Success of his Ministry. And tho' the Offices of Pastor and Teacher hath not the Authority, as that of an Apostle, nor the call so extraordinary, <hi>yet despise not the day of small things;</hi> for they are the blessed Ordinances of God, and shall have
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:154381:150"/> their due Efficacy upon the Hearts and Heads of those exercised therein, and it is there God commands the blessing.</p>
                  <p>And by the way the Separation to the work of the Ministry is ascribed to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, who is the executive power of the Trinity: And therefore it is said, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. <hi>Feed the Flock, over whom the Holy Ghost has made you Overseers;</hi> and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle says, 1 Cor. 12. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Now concerning Spiritual Gifts, Brethren, I would not have you ignorant, ye know that ye were</hi> Gentiles, <hi>carryed away unto these dumb Idols, even as ye were led; wherefore I give you to understand, that no Man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed, and that no Man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</hi> The Apostle convinces them, that those Spiritual Gifts and Offices which were among them, were meerly Gifts out of Grace, tho' a common Grace to ungodly Men, to the Rebellious also. He convinces them by this, that they were Supernatural, for till my Ministry and the Gospel came among you (says he) you were far enough from such Gifts. Ye know that you were <hi>Gentiles</hi> carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away unto these dumb Idols, even as you were led. And therefore if you have any knowledge of Christ, it must be from the Spirit, as an Heavenly Agent, that is come upon you all. The knowledge of, and assent to Jesus as the Lord, must be from the Holy Ghost, you have it not by Nature, you were led after dumb Idols. These Gifts are all Supernatural, and from a Divine Agent, and in that respect they are called Graces, and a Gift. But then the making a Man a Minister, and putting him into the Divine Office, whether of Pastor or Teacher, is no less then a work of all the three Persons, and not of the Holy Ghost only. There is a conjunction of all three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, blessing, and laying on of Hands, as it were, upon a Minister ordained, 1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Now there are diversities of Gifts; but the same Spirit. And there are differences of Administrations, but the same Lord. And there are diversities of Operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</hi> There you have all the three Persons, the Gifts of a Minister are from the Spirit, the Administration, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Offices wherein a Man Administers, as from Christ as a Lord, the Operations, the powerfull Success that works upon Mens Hearts by them, is from God the Father; you see your calling, Brethren, as the Apostle speaks in another case, I mean you Brethren of the Ministry, learn to follow your callings and your Authority. When Christ laid his Hand upon <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 1. how did it revive him, and put life into him. All three Persons in the Work, do lay on their Hands. We count it a great concurrent dispensation of God, that each Person in the Trinity should share the works of our Salvation among them, and it is a wonderful thing to bless them for it: But seldom have the three Persons concurred in one Action. When Christ was Baptized, and God himself Proclaimed, <hi>thou art my Son,</hi> there were all the three Persons. The Father was heard by speaking himself immediately, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost was descending as a dove upon Christ, and the Son of God was himself in the water. And here is another <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> an appearance of God, three in Persons at the Ordination of a Minister.</p>
                  <p>Which notion is confirmed and backed by our Apostle, in naming two of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Father, and the Son, as Authors of the Instituted Officers of a Church, Gal. 1. 1. Paul <hi>an Apostle not of Men, neither by Man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the Dead.</hi> There is two of them, the Will of the Father, and Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the third Person, you have in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. as expresly named, to be a Founder of this Work; <hi>Separate me</hi> Paul, <hi>for the Work I have appointed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And from hence you may learn, what Holy, Holy, Holy, Ground it is, that an Instituted Officer of the New Testament stands upon, which Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> in his <hi>Diocesan Tryal</hi> hath firmly asserted, and it sets right, and corrects the brownist Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror at their first setting out, who looked on their Ministers but as Servants of the Church, and Instituted by the Church only, which is but of Human Institution, <hi>(Gal.</hi> 1. 1.) and so they chose them anew, to officiate in their several turns, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but Brethren still. But Mr. <hi>Baynes</hi> makes them the immediate Servants of Christ, who is the Institutor of them.</p>
                  <p>And from hence I assert, that a Minister is a Servant of Christ to the Church, to do his work to the Church as occasion is. Before his call unto the Ministry, he was as Gold in the Bulloyn fit for, and capable of the Ministry; and the Church in Christ's Name chooses him, and Sets upon him the Seal of a Sacred Separation of him unto Christ. And in Christ's Name he acts toward them, Independently on
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:154381:151"/> them, till he shall forfeit himself and his calling, by deserving to be Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.</p>
                  <p>And hence I assert also, that they are not only Ministers to that Church which calls them, but Preach as Ministers, and with a Ministerial blessing accompanying them, whereever they are called to Preach. And herein doth A singly called, though Gifted Man, fall short of that blessing which accompanies a Minister, rightly separated unto an Office of Ministery in a Church. There were some in the Church either of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> or <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> that were called principal Brethren, yet only Brethren, tho' the word <hi>Principal</hi> is annexed. And it is an ordinary Stile in the Epistles, when the Apostle speaks of the Brethren in a Church, who are chiefly such, he Stiles them <hi>one of you;</hi> yea, tho' they be acknowledged by the Apostles to have been helpful to them: Whereas when they have been separated to the Ministry, either as Pastor or Teacher of the Church, <hi>Paul</hi> gives the Honourable Title of <hi>unto you</hi> (speaking of that Church.) <hi>A Faithful Minister,</hi> and under that Title he sets out <hi>Epaphras</hi> to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> who was Minister to their Church; yea, and hence it comes to pass, that when ever they Preach to any either called or to be called, they may be said to Preach as Ministers to them. When <hi>(Ephes.</hi> 4. 12.) their ordinary Pastors and Teachers are said to be in the work of the Ministry, they are said to be in it not only for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Body of Christ, that is already his Body; but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for the joynting in, as Members of the Body, such as are yet unconverted and out of joynt, and loose from them, tho' Elect, and if they be Ministers (as 'tis there expresly said) to the joynting of them in, then they are Ministers before conversion, to them, whom to convert, blesses them as Ministers. And what other is the reason, why those who have been fixed Ministers to a People, and by Persecution are driven out, have that allowance too given to them by Christ, who says, Mat. 10. 23. <hi>If they persecute you in one City, fly unto another.</hi> For Jesus Christ is not a loser thereby; but he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows on his blessing of them for Conversion unto a new People: For why? They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Ministry along with them, and Preach as Ministers to whomever they Preach, for they Preach <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for the joynting of them in. Know therefore that your Ministry or being Ministers, doth not stand on your own feet, but on Christ's feet, in whose Hand these Stars are for their further Motion, Guidance, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and Blessing on them.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Communion of Saints, which the Members of a Church ought to have one with another.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving proved that Christ hath instituted divers sorts of Officers to be in a Church, and having described the distinction of their Offices: The thing next to be considered is, what communion the Members of such a Church ought to have one with another (besides the Communion which they publickly enjoy in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances) for their mutual edification and increase of their Graces.</p>
                  <p>The Communion which I intend, is not by way of exercising Gifts, but of Grace: A Communion not in the way of a set Institution or Ordinance; but in the way of a fit means, and help to encrease that love which ought to be between one Member and another. The question in sum is, whether every Member is not bound to seek the knowledge of every Member's Spirit and Graces, and that not only by occasional converse; but by fixed meetings appointed on purpose for such Spiritual converse, to know one another's cases and spirits, and <hi>to provoke one another to love, and to good works, Heb.</hi> 10. 24. There are two things which must be supposed as unavoidably to be granted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That every Member of a Church cannot in publick edifie the others, for Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men must not speak in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34, 35. And besides, publick meetings are for exercise of Gifts, which even all the Men have not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In private occasional converse, one Member may not have opportunity to discourse with another once in seven years: For when will occasion offer for a godly Servant, to discourse with the Master of another Family? There seems then to be a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:154381:151"/> of a fixed meeting to this very end, that such opportunities may be afforded to them.</p>
                  <p>And 3. It may be demanded whether for these Members, who occasionally perhaps meet every day, such appointed meetings are not necessary, that there may be a set time for this Spiritual Conversation? It is not meant that herein there should be Preaching or Praying; but a Spiritual Conference to gain experience of each others improvements in Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I shall consider whether this be a Duty, and what in a Church-Fellowship should bind the Members of it to such a Duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is certain, that one Member should make known his Spiritual case and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to another, of known Faithfulness, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 5. 16.) And that he should make known too his needs or wants of any kind, not to the Minister only; but to any of the Members of the Church, who is in a special manner known to be Faithful, that he may pray for him, confess your faults (says the Apostle) and Pray one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that you may be healed. <hi>The effectual Fervent Prayer of a Righteous Man avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much. That Pbrase, confess your faults one to another,</hi> is not general, as if it were to be done to every one; but the Apostles design is to shew, that there are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions upon which this Duty is to be done to some.</p>
                  <p>But 2. That place in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24. seems to call for, and require a more special Animadversion to know one another's cases and experiences, and that not only as they may be made known occasionally, but to enquire, of ones own accord, and to take occasion to do it. <hi>Let us consider one another</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>to provoke unto love and to good works,</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the same which is used to exqress, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 7. 4.) The diligent enquiry, and exact Animadversion which we ought to make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our selves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This also seems to call for such a stated converse of Church-Members together to enquire into, and know one another's cases and experiences; because otherwise every Member would not have an equal benefit in Church-Communion. For some that are Rich, and have time to converse much together, may indeed reap the fruits of a blessed Fellowship. But others that are poor, or Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will be abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and so the same inconveniences will arise, as were in the <hi>Corinthians Love Feasts,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, it is evident from Scripture, that it is the Duty of every Member to observe, and to take care of another's Spiritual Wellfare. This appears from the Duty enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24. And it is a Duty distinct from Assembling together, which follows in the next verse. The same thing is also manifest from that Text, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Wherefore comfort your selves together, and edifie one another, even as ye do.</hi> The Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>exhort and edifie one another,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. i. e. <hi>every one of you, do this Duty to every one.</hi> And the Apostle commends them, that it was their practice so to do, <hi>even as also</hi> (says he) <hi>you do:</hi> So that a Primitive Apostolical Church, did practise this Duty: And this was distinct from the work of these Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, for of them he speaks afterwards, <hi>verse</hi> 12. And then he tells them the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways wherein they should exercise this Duty one towards another, verse 14. <hi>Now we exhort you Brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient, toward all Men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the question is, whether this Duty is only to be exercised occasionally, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God gives opportunities and occasions of converse, and according to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations wherein he hath set Men, of Man and Wife, Master and Servant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That as we ought to give to poor Saints, when there is occasion, so it is Duty also to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, Admonish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when an opportunity is offered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is evident that this Duty is to be discharged between Persons who live in these Relations, and as Man and Wife have more occasion of converse, so more of this Duty is incumbent upon them. They not only as Members of a Church, but, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such Relations, ought to serve the ends of Church-fellowship: And the greater the occasion is, the more are they obliged to this Duty, tho he ows it as a Member, yet he is bound the more to exercise it in this occasional way of Relation, Eph. 4. 16. <hi>From whom the whole Body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joynt supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the Body unto the edifying of it self in love.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. He mentions here the Edification of the Members, by the Members, as consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered distinct from their Officers.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> fitly joyned evinceth as much: It signifies being joyned as with Sinews and Bones, for so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is taken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. And so here is it to be understood; for the Apostle speaks of a Body which every joynt supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as he also useth the word, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. The Body is knit by Joynts, and the nourishment is supplyed from Christ. And it is knit together not only by Joynts, but by Sinews, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12.) which run between every one. So then there are Joints by which Christ supplyeth Nourishment to the Body, and there are Sinews by which the Members of that Body are joyned together, and those are the several Relations which the Members have one to another, either as in a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in the Offices of the Church. For if there were no other Relation, yet this of Membership in a Church is one sufficient, since all the Members have from Christ a measure of Supplies for the Nourishment, and strengthening of the whole Body. And the Laws of Life and Motion are as natural here, as they are in Bodies of Flesh and Blood. For as the several parts of them receive Spirits from the Head to enliven and move them, so, to all the Members of Christ's Body the Church, the Spirit is convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him the Head, to give Spiritual Life and Motion to them all, and so to the whole Body. So that if there were no other Relation between the Saints, but this of their being set and joyned in one Body the Church, and not in a Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> only: yet this is enough for their mutual Life, Strength, and Edification, 1 Cor. 12. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 22. <hi>For the Body is not one Member, but many. If the foot shall say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the Body: Is it therefore not of the Body? And if the ear shall say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the Body; is it therefore not of the Body? If the whole Body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? But now hath God set the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, every one of them in the Body, as it hath pleased him. And if they were all one Member, where were the Body? But now are they many Members, yet but one Body. And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: Nor again, the Head to the feet, I have no need of you. Nay, much more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se Members of the Body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary.</hi> And indeed every Member hath some Grace, or some Experiences wherein it differs from another, and is helpful to it. As the Members of the Natural Body, tho' consisting of the same Flesh and Blood, yet dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in some properties wherein they excell, and wherein they are useful to the other: So every Member in a Church hath some peculiar Grace by which the other may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. So <hi>Paul</hi> says of himself, writing to the Church of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he was comforted by their mutual Faith, not by their Gifts, Rom. 1. 12. <hi>That is, that I may be comforted together with you, by the mutual Faith both of you and me.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he says, that when in conference with the other Apostles, there was nothing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, yet their discerning the Grace of God which was in him, had the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red effect, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 6. 9. There is then no Member in a Church, but what is necessary and helpful, and no one can say, that he hath no need of another. Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle tells us, that they who are feeble are necessary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 22. And therefore he argues, <hi>(ver.</hi> 25.) that all should have the same care one of another, tho' never so mean an object. And <hi>(ver.</hi> 27.) says he, <hi>you are the Body of Christ, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in particular,</hi> not only Members for the use of the whole Body, but for the use of every one Member considered apart.</p>
                  <p>There are three expressions used by the Apostle, which shew that the care which the Saints in Church-Fellowship together ought to have over one another, should not only be exercised as occasion offers; but that it is a constant Duty, and that we ought to seek all occasions of acting it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Apostle says, Heb. 10. 24. <hi>And let us consider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works.</hi> The Greek words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, let us accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately consider one another, that our care over one another may be answerable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The same Apostle speaks in like manner, 1 Cor. 12. 25. <hi>That there should be no Schism in the Body; but that the Members should have the same care one for another.</hi> The Greek word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, signifies, that we should have an especial and solicitous care of one another's Souls.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:154381:152"/> 3. What the Apostle says in another place, is to the same purpose, 1 Thess. 5. 11. <hi>Wherefore comfort your selves together, and edifie one another, even as also ye do.</hi> The Greek words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, import not a General, but a particular care, not only occasional, but such as we should study, and endeavour to exercise for the edification particularly of every one. But besides there are these further Reasons of the thing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because there is this difference between the Members of the Church Universal, and the Members of a particular Church, that the former are obliged to those Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of taking care to help and edifie one another, as occasion serves; but the other are bound by a more especial covenant to perform this Duty, one to another in a constant manner, and therefore ought to seek occasion for it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The same thing is evident from this, that every Member hath in him something that is needful for another (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 22.) tho' not in Gifts, yet in Graces, by which the strongest may profit; as <hi>Paul</hi> increased in Faith, by the mutual Faith in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, (Rom.</hi> 1, 12.) tho' in the Gifts nothing could be added to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There would not otherwise be the same care taken of all, that there is of some, which is contrary to what the Apostle enjoyns, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25. And Reason shews, that care should rather be taken of the weak, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 22, 23. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 14. And the neglect and despising of the poor and weak, was the fault of the Loue-Feasts, which the Apostle reproves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because otherwise the Relation of being a Member in a particular Church, would add nothing to the Person, as proper to such a Relation, if one Member was not thereby bound to be helpful to another, not only occasionally, but on set purpose, and on appointed times, when occasions are not offered.</p>
                  <p>But the question will be, how this care which every Member is to have of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will differ from the care which is incumbent upon the Officers to take of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Officers are bound to their care in a more especial manner, and the exercise of it is incumbent on them, <hi>ex officio,</hi> by vertue of their Office. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, their care reacheth to the whole Church, but every Member's care to another, Rom. 12. 4, 5. <hi>For as we have many Members in one Body, and all Members have not the same Office: So we being many, are one Body in Christ, and every one Members one of another.</hi> The Greek word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>Activeness,</hi> working, so, that it is evident from this Text of Scripture, that every Member hath its peculiar working, as we say, that the Eye hath not only its Office; but the Ear also hath an Office proper to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Officers are wholy in this work, and entirely devoted to it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Officers have the charge of the whole, and of every part, which is not incumbent on the private Brethren. Tho' in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. The Apostle mentions the Authority and work of the Officers; yet withal he insinuates the activeness and working of each Member as needful, Rom. 12. 4, 5. <hi>For as we have many Members in one Body, and all Members have not the same Office: So we being many, are one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Christ, and every one Members one of another.</hi> And so, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. he speaks of works and duties, which are incumbent on more Persons then the Officers of the Church. And the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> also speaks of private Members, and their Duty and Work, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 5. For he speaks of the Elders and their Office, in the <hi>5th</hi> Chapter which follows.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is made a sign of Grace, for Saints to visit each other. It discovered the Truth of Grace, and Faith in <hi>Moses</hi>'s Heart, that he visited his Brethren. <hi>James</hi> makes it also a Trial of the Sincerity of our Grace. Isa. 1. 27. <hi>Zion shall be Redeemed with Judgment, and her Converts with Righteousness.</hi> And our Lord Jesus makes it the Touchstone and Test of his chosen Sheep, when he separates them from the Goats, that they visited the poor little ones among his Saints, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 36, 40. And if there is the like Reason to visit the Members of a Church, then certainly it is to be done. We are to show our love to their Souls, to visit and refresh them; for Souls have need, as well as Bodies; and require suitable supplies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Prophet mentions it as the Duty and Practice of Saints under the Gospel, to speak often one to another, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. What he speaks of those times, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ours.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:154381:153"/> 5. There ought to be so great and peculiar a love between the Members of a Church, as cannot be discharged but in the performance of this special Office and Duty, Rom 12. 10. <hi>Be kindly affectioned one to another, with Brotherly love, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour preferring one another.</hi> It is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>A Natural instinct of Affection</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Natural Love, such as Parents bear to their Children, and Brethren to Brethren. And in this they are to increase and abound, 1 Thess. 3. 12. <hi>And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one towards another, and towards all Men, even as we do towards you.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 8. <hi>And above all things have fervent Charity among your selves, for Charity shall cover a multitude of sins.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,, such a Fervency as presseth to a mark. It is pure Love, all inordinacy of Love, of self, of Wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is removed, any inordinacy would take too much, that there would not be love e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for all the Brotherhood. As it is such a love, so it is a growing Love; and therefore what is necessary for the feeding it, is necessary to put forth towards the Members of the Church, which how can it be done without a Communion maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Whatever other Relations binds us to, we are engaged to the same Duties by our Relation of Brethren in a Church. If obligations of Civility, or tyes of Nature, and Kindred engage Men to visit one another, then, much more the Relation of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in a Church, obligeth us to the same Duty. And the poorest, meanest Saint, is as worthy of it as any; for otherwise <hi>we should have the Faith of our Lord Jesus with respect of Persons,</hi> which the Apostle forbids, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the Work and Business of the Officers in a Church, take off this care from the private Members, and render it unnecessary: And besides, they have other Callings, as being Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they ought to mind and attend.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis true, but yet these are Duties which occasionally they ought to perform. As if offence be given them, they are enjoyned to speak and admonish the Person, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. They are required also to do good, as opportunity serves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 24. If any thing be Revealed to a Person, it is proper for him to tell it, if there be leisure or opportunity, whereas an Officer ought always to have something ready for Edification.</p>
                  <p>The main question to be discoursed, is, wherein this Duty lies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It doth not properly consist in the communication of such Gifts, whereby the Church is edified in the publick Worship of God: It doth not properly consist in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in Praying together, tho' this may be done occasionally. There are two sorts of Gifts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such as are Superadded to Graces, and are Sanctified to a publick use, as the Gift of expression in Prayer, of Prophecying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are such Gifts as are necessary to communicate, and make known our Graces one to another; as to be able to express what experiences of God's love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we have had; for, as the thoughts of our minds cannot be known, unless we have a Tongue to express them, so neither can our Graces be known without such a Gift: Now the end of this communion of Saints, whereof I now Discourse, is not to make known such Gifts; but to communicate experiences, not to Repeat Sermons, (which is a Duty proper to Families) but to declare what it was in a Sermon that God blessed to them, and that affected their Hearts, what promises they have found to be made good to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Duty of communion of Saints, doth not consist in giving an account of their Graces in that set way, as they gave an account of their conversion, when they were first admitted into the Church. But it is a communication of their experiences, as to the growth of their Graces, and as to the exercise of them. The Graces of a Believer, the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>may be known of God in him,</hi> may rather appear thus, by way of conference, than in a Set Narration. The Reason of it, is, because an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Person's Grace is not now given; for a Judgment to be made of his state thereupon, as it was at his Admission into the Church. There is not in this case any Autoritative Act; for none have power to call for an account. But the Duty incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the Person, is, to consider whether the Declaration of his Experiences may be for the edifying and comforting of others, and what good fruits may arise out of such a Manifestation, and accordingly to do it. 'Tis to be minded, what God leads a Man's Spirit to confer about. There is such a thing as a Manifestation of Spirits in a several way, whereby is not meant, that a person is obliged to lay open all that is in
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:154381:153"/> his Heart; but that by a mutual conference concerning Spiritual things, there should be a tast given what is in one another's Spirits.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This communion doth not consist in a confession of all sins, or in discovery of every thing that burthens us. For to that end, a Believer will make choice of some particular, in whose Wisdom and Faithfulness he can confide as occasion is, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 16. As for extraordinary cases, wherein there is need of help, as in case of Feeble-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, (1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 4.) Temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no need for any Believer to tell his case to all the Members of the Church particularly, that they may all pray for him, for upon his making it known to the Pastor or Officers, he may be prayed for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But yet that love which the Members of a Church bear one to another, will move them, and put them upon a Sollicitousness, and a study, and care for each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Souls.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us consider that Subjection, in which all the Members ought to be one, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another, whereof the Apostle speaks, 1 Pet. 5. 5. <hi>Likewise ye younger, submit your selves unto the elder; yea, all of you be Subject to one another, and be cloathed with Humility: For God Resisteth the proud, and giveth Grace to the Humble.</hi> I cannot conceive otherwise, but that by this Subjection, (the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) is meant, that they should be content to receive instruction one from another.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is to be considered, that Christ puts an Honour on the weakest Members, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 18. to 24. And that there may be no Schism in the Body, application must be made to one, as well as to another; and there must not be a total neglect of any, 1 Cor. 12. 25. <hi>That there should be no Schism in the Body; but that the Members should have the same care one for another.</hi> And so likewise the Apostle tells us, that there are diversities of Gifts, and Administrations, and Operations, 1 Cor. 12. 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Now there are diversities of Gifts, but the same Spirit; And there are differences of Administrations, but the same Lord, and there are diversities of Operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all; but the manifestation of the Spirit, is given to every Man to profit withal.</hi> These diversities of gifts, and administrations, do not relate to Officers only, but to the whole Body; so that a course should be taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit of every Member's gift. For otherwise there will be a neglect of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who are the Fountain of these diverse gifts and administrations.</p>

                  <p>THE Apostle having proved at large in the former part of his chapter, and the whole Epistle, that the Righteousness of Christ apprehended by Faith, was the only true Righteousness whereby Men are to be Saved; he begins here at the <hi>14th</hi> verse of this Chapter, to lay down the outward instrumental means of attaining to this Righteousness and Salvation; and this by a gradation or chain of causes: All which he shews to hang upon <hi>Preaching of the word of Faith,</hi> as the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:154381:154"/> first Link of that whole chain of outward means. And as (in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30.) he makes a chain of the <hi>Principal causes</hi> of our Salvation: <hi>Whom he fore-knew, those he predistinated, and whom he predistinated, those he also called, &amp;c.</hi> so here he makes a chain of the <hi>means outward,</hi> praying and worshipping God, (that is the first step) <hi>whosoever shall call upon the Name of the Lord, shall be saved, ver.</hi> 13. without pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er there is no Salvation; it is here (by a <hi>Synecdoche)</hi> put for all Obedience. But then <hi>how shall they call on God without Faith, and how Believe without hearing, and how shall they hear without a Preacher? ver.</hi> 4. For it is such a hearing, as is by <hi>Preaching;</hi> neither is this Preaching (the Hearing whereof is blessed to work Faith) by any but <hi>by Men sent; ver.</hi> 15. And the conclusion of all this is, that <hi>Faith cometh by Hearing, ver.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>And Experience also helps to manifest and confirm this. For still, where God meant to have a Church called, thither he still sends, and there he maintains the Preaching of the Gospel. For this, compare <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 6, 8. with the <hi>9th</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> verses of the <hi>18th</hi> chapter: In that first cited place it is said, that God forbad <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach in <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinia,</hi> but in this other, that he bad him stay and Preach at <hi>Corinth,</hi> giving this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; for <hi>I have much People in this City.</hi> So also, says the Apostle, Col. 1. 1, 4, 5. <hi>Knowing the Election of God, our Gospel came unto you, not in word only, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore we see that those places that want it, lie like Desarts and Wildernesses, full of rudeness and ignorance; and the Inhabitants living rather like Beasts than Men. And this is the reason why the light of the Gospel, and the Preaching thereof shifts so from place to place; (in the <hi>East</hi> once, now in the <hi>West)</hi> for still where God hath a good shole and fry of Fish, thither he sends his Fishers with their Dragg-Nets: It being good Fishing sometimes in one Coast, sometimes in another. Where God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Plant a Church, thither he sends the Gospel, <hi>to make known by it the Mystery of his Will, that in the Dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together, in one, all his Elect, Ephes.</hi> 1. 9, 10. what is the reason of this?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Take that which the Apostle intimates in this, Rom. 10. 17. <hi>Faith comes by Hearing:</hi> And how so? <hi>Hearing is by the word of God.</hi> So that if the Reason be askt, why this way rather than any other? the answer is, it is so appointed and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> by God: For that is meant by <hi>Word</hi> here, his <hi>Word</hi> being all one with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment and Appointment. So says Christ, Luke 4. 4. <hi>Man lives not by Bread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but by every</hi> word <hi>of God;</hi> that is, by this Ordinance of God, that Bread should Nourish; it is not said <hi>Hearing</hi> [of] <hi>the Word,</hi> but <hi>[by] the Word.</hi> What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Rain that falls down upon the Earth from these <hi>Bottles of Heaven,</hi> the Clouds, <hi>drops such fatness</hi> with it? and <hi>Crowns the year</hi> with encrease, <hi>Psal.</hi> 65. 11. It is only this; God at the beginning did so appoint it; as we read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 5. Now <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 10, 11. it is said, <hi>As the Rain cometh down and watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>so shall my Word go forth and prosper in the thing whereto I appointed and sent it.</hi> It shall prosper, because God so appointed it; and it shall cause the Earth both to <hi>bring forth and bud;</hi> that is, it shall work both beginnings and encrease. Yea, it doth that which other Rain doth not: For other Rain falling on a Briar, it remaineth a Briar still; but where this Rain falls, God accompanying it with a blessing, in stead of a Thorn, comes <hi>up</hi> a Fir; and, of Fuel for Hell, it makes Men fruitful Trees to God, and fit for his Building; for it fully alters the Nature of them: And though watering the Earth with water-pots is good and useful in the time of Drought, and so is Reading of good Books, and conferring of things Holy: Yet Preaching is the kindly Ordinance, when <hi>Doctrine drops as the Rain, and speech distills as the Dew, and as small Rain upon the tender Herb;</hi> as in Preaching it still doth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As <hi>God appointed it,</hi> so <hi>Jesus Christ prayed for it,</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 17. Christ conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates his Death, and prays for the Application of it, namely, that the Apostles might be <hi>Sanctified,</hi> and how! <hi>through thy Truth</hi> (says Christ) that is, the <hi>Gospel</hi> called <hi>the word of Truth, Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. and then he goes oh to pray, <hi>not only for those, but for all that should believe,</hi> and how should they come to believe? <hi>through their word:</hi> So, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, &amp; 20. And certain it is, that Christ's Intercession puts a force into this means unto this Day. For doth Christ mean only the Apostles Preaching, as that which he then Prayed for? No, this Prayer reacheth <hi>unto the ends of the World:</hi> For it is their word that we do and shall Preach, and we are their Successors. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>(Matth.</hi> 28. 20.) Christ says (though he speak only to his Disciples) <hi>I am with you unto the end of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:154381:155"/> 3. As God the Father <hi>appointed it,</hi> and God the Son <hi>prayed for it;</hi> so God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is by promise and covenant engaged to accompany it with his blessing unto the Seed of Christ for ever, Isa. 59. 21. <hi>My Spirit who is upon thee, and my words which I have put into thy Mouth, shall not depart out of thy Mouth, nor out of the Mouth of thy Seeds Seed for ever.</hi> It is spoken of the word as Preacht unto the People, and therefore we find (Acts 10. 44.) <hi>Whilst</hi> Peter <hi>spake, the Holy Ghost fell on all them who heard the word.</hi> And therefore it is, that (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4.) the Preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is called the <hi>Demonstration of the Spirit;</hi> and (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 8.) the <hi>Ministration of the Spirit:</hi> Now if any demand the reason why God ordained it, and Christ prayed for it, rather than any other means; I shall for the Explanation of this, propound cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain queries, in the answers to which, I will give the reason of it, and I shall proceed herein by degrees:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Why did not God work immediately by his own power, and rather use no means at all?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He doth this to shew his diverse manner of working, for he still loves to vary his Dispensations towards Man. At the first Creation he used no means, but made Man in his own Image; even as when he gave the Law, he both made the Stone-Tables immediately, and also writ it with his own Finger. But now in this Recreation and Renewing of the Image, because he will not go the same way to work, he will take a Pen in his Hand to do it withal. <hi>Ye are,</hi> (says the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3) <hi>the Epistle of Christ Ministred by us.</hi> And tho' God made the World without the help of Angels, or any other Creature; yet now in this New Creation, he is pleased to shew his diverse ways of working, and takes Creatures to work by; whom therefore he calls <hi>Co-workers</hi> with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2 He now useth means, as to shew his various kinds of working, so to hide it from the eyes of the undiscerning World, who contemn the means to their Destruction. For this work of Conversion, being the only standing Miracle in the Church (and indeed the greatest, and therefore all is summed up in it) Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hides his power in working it, <hi>The blind</hi> (says he) <hi>receive their sight, the deaf hear, and the poor receive the Gospel;</hi> but he lets them not see from whom all this comes, and by whom it is wrought: That so that might come upon the foolish World, which was fore-prophecyed, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 5. and alledged by the Apostle, Acts 13. 41. <hi>Behold! ye Despisers, and Wonder, and Perish; for I work a work among you, which you will in no wise believe, though it be declared unto you.</hi> Because the means are so small, and so unlikely, therefore it is that the World despises God's Word and People; and they wonder at this, that such weak means should have such power on mens Hearts, and yet they believe it not; they feel no such thing in their own Hearts, and so falling to despise it, they perish in their own ways. You have it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 2. that <hi>'tis the glory of God to conceal a thing,</hi> to carry his greatest Counsels and Works covertly and closely; and therefore he hides them under means, because all should not see them. So, when he sent his Son, how did he befool the Devil and the World, in sending the Prince of glory, clad and concealed in infirmities, to be Crucified, and so to bring about God's greatest work? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. But why, of all things else, hath he chosen his Word to do this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. He hath chosen Preaching of the Word, because it is the weakest means of all other; and therefore his power would the more appear unto his own glory in it. What is weaker then a word? And yet God Created the World by it; for he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light, &amp;c.</hi> But you will say; that was his own word spoken by himself. I answer, that now to manifest his power the more, he will take the voice of a frail Man speaking his Word for him; and what is weaker then a Man's Breath? Indeed, <hi>In the word of a King there is power,</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks) but what power is there in the words of a mean and weak Man? Yes, there is a great power; and the reason why God chose this means is given, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. to <hi>ver.</hi> 28. It is to shew his power and wisdom unto his own, and to confound the World. They know not God in <hi>his Wisdom,</hi> by reason of their <hi>own Wisdom,</hi> which they are so full of, and by reason of their High Esteem of Worldly <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Eloquence,</hi> accounting the plain, naked, and low Stile of the Word, to be but <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness;</hi> that is, a foolish and an empty Doctrine, contrary to their Reason, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unlike to work any great matter (as the <hi>Athenians</hi> thought.) But God chose it the rather; <hi>it pleased him, by the foolishness of Preaching, to save them that Believe,</hi>
                     <pb n="307" facs="tcp:154381:155"/> ver. 21. to shew that <hi>his Foolishness is wiser than Mens Wisdom:</hi> And if his Foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness be so, then, what is his Wisdom? He sent his Apostles forth, a company of poor Fishermen; and were they likely Men to conquer the World, by commanding living Men to believe on one Crucified? Especially when the conditions were such as these, that Men Rich and Learned, and Great, should wholy deny themselves and their own Wisdom, and become fools; was this ever likely? Well, but see, <hi>(ver.</hi> 20.) how the Apostle Triumphs upon this occasion. <hi>Where is the Wise? Where is the Scribe? Where is the Disputer?</hi> They are clear put down; they have lost ground both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by this foolish and weak means, this Preaching of Christ Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. All their Wit, and Carnal Arguments, could not prevail so much as one of the Apostles Sermons. And so when <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and those other Divines came once to Preach, where were the School-men and Learned of the World? Popery fell down before Preaching, like <hi>Dagon</hi> before the Ark of God. And God appointed this way, that his Wisdom might appear to the confusion of the Wise; that so his power might the more appear to the praise of his grace towards them that are called, and to the confusion of Satan, and <hi>(ver.</hi> 25.) to shew that <hi>the weakness of God is stronger then Men.</hi> If God can by a word work such effects, as all Creatures are not able to work; then what would his strength do, if put to it? What will that power do for his Elect in another World? And this means did God appoint, thereby also to confound the power of Satan, as the strength of <hi>Jericho</hi> was subdued by the blasts of Rams Horns. Thus <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. it is said, <hi>Out of the Mouths of Babes and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, hast thou ordained strength:</hi> Through the weakest means, God hath ordained the greatest strength; and why? <hi>to still the Enemy;</hi> to confound Satan, that he should not boast of his Conquest. God therefore chose Preaching, that it might <hi>be his own power unto Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. The Second Reason why, of all means else, God hath chosen his Word, as the means whereby to work grace, and to Reveal himself unto us, rather then any other visible Representation, whereby he might have made himself known; yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by his Works (tho' they are said to <hi>Preach</hi> also, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. compared with <hi>Psal.</hi> 8. implies) was because the word was less apt to be abused to Idolatry, by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, of all things else. This was the most naked and simple Representation, and most suitable to Reasonable Creatures that could be, to Represent things by words. God made himself known by Creatures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. and what was the issue of it? <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. Men fell to <hi>Worship the Creature,</hi> in stead of <hi>God the Creator, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the glory of the Incorruptible God, into an Image made like to corruptible Man,</hi> &amp;c. The Sun and other glorious Creatures Represented God, and they Worshipt those <hi>Creatures more than God,</hi> and ascribed all unto them. Thus also in the time of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when Preaching was Banisht, they Represented all Religion to the Eye; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of which, Man is more apt to Idolize, then the instructions which he barely receives by the Ear. An evident instance whereof we have in this; that whereas God ordained but two means to convey the Gospel to us, one by the word Preached to the Ear; the other to the Eye in Sacraments; which are visible signs (and as Christ is Preached in the one, so in the other; and indeed no more in the one, than in the other) yet corrupt Nature made an Idol of the Sacrament, and never of Preaching, and this Men did, tho God chose the meanest things to these Signs, even Bread and Wine. And for this cause especially God Sanctified his word, as a means to convey himself unto us; as appears by Deut. 4. 12. <hi>The Lord spake unto you, and ye heard the voice of his words; but saw no Similitude,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. The third query is, why <hi>Hearing</hi> of the Word should be by God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed rather than <hi>Reading</hi> of it alone by our selves?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God hath appointed the hearing of the word; because he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds Satan, and untwists and dissolve the works of the Devil in the same way that they were woven. Our first Parents took their infidelity in by the Ear; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God thought good to let Faith in the same way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Because God had many simple People to be called; and indeed, <hi>not many wise,</hi> nor book-learned are of that number; and if Reading were the ordinary means, how should they do? But the simplest can ordinarily <hi>hear,</hi> as well as the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest: And so <hi>the poor</hi> do come to <hi>receive the Gospel,</hi> who otherwise would want it.</p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:154381:156"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 4. The fourth Query is, why hath God ordained hearing the word <hi>expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> rather than hearing it read? So we find it, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 7, 8. It is said, <hi>The</hi> Levites <hi>read in the Book of God's Law distinctly, giving the Sense, and causing them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Reading;</hi> that is, the word read. The same we have, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 9. The Levites <hi>went about with the Book of the Law, and taught the People,</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because of the dullness that is in many People, Acts 8. 30. <hi>understandest thou what thou readest?</hi> (said <hi>Phillip</hi> to the Eunuch) <hi>how can I,</hi> (says he) <hi>except some Man should guide me?</hi> It was therefore necessary, that there should be Men whose calling and business it should be, to study out the meaning of the word, and so to Reveal it unto others; and who might (as <hi>Ezrah</hi> did, chap. 7. 10.) <hi>prepare their Hearts,</hi> (and set themselves apart) <hi>to seek the Law</hi> (or the meaning of it) <hi>and to Teach in</hi> Israel, <hi>Statutes and Judgments;</hi> and (as <hi>Timothy)</hi> wholy give themselves to <hi>attend on Reading,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because Jesus Christ, when he ascended, <hi>gave Gifts unto Men; Ephes.</hi> 4. 8. And 1. <hi>The Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge</hi> being in him, <hi>(Col.</hi> 2. 3.) least when he went to Heaven, he should have carryed all Wisdom away with him; therefore, as he left the word written behind him, so he gave Gifts to Men to expound it, both for the begetting and perfecting of the Saints. Now as for simply <hi>Reading</hi> the word, every one can do that; but an <hi>Interpreter</hi> is <hi>one of a Thousand, Job.</hi> 33. 23. And it were a Derogation from Christ, to make a faculty of bare Reading, to be one of the utmost fruits of his Ascension. And for this Reason also it is, that the Gifts of Men are reckoned among the chiefest Goods and Riches in a Christian's Inventory, 1 Cor. 3. 22: <hi>All are yours,</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Apollo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. It is not the Letter of the word, that ordinarily doth convert; but the Spiritual meaning of it, as Revealed and Expounded. <hi>Paul</hi> who had the Letter of the Law; yet says of himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. that he was <hi>without the Law,</hi> until the Spiritual meaning of it was Revealed to him. There is the <hi>Letter,</hi> the Husk, and there is the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the Kernel; and when we by Expounding the word, do open the Husk, [out] drops the Kernel. It is the <hi>meaning</hi> of the word, which is the word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is the Sense of it which is its Soul. The Devil quoting Scripture, used the Letter of it; but the Apostles, when they quote it, alledge not so much the words as the meaning. And therefore (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16.) we are said to <hi>have the mind of Christ;</hi> that is, what he meant in his word, when he Revealed it. Now Preaching, in a more special manner, Reveals God's word. When an Ointment-Box is once <hi>opened,</hi> then it casts its Savour about; and when the Juice of a Medicinal Herb is once strain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out and applyed, then it heals. And so it is the Spiritual <hi>meaning</hi> of the word let into the Heart, which converts it, and turns it to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 5. The fifth Query is, If we are to be Saved rather by Hearing the word Expounded, than by it as Read; yet still, why by it only as Preacht by Men like our selves? Why not by God's immediate Voice from Heaven, or why not by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Angels? The Reasons of it are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because Men themselves first chose this way, as most agreeable and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto themselves, and unto their Natures and Conditions, Deut. 5. 25, 26. <hi>If we hear the Voice of the Lord our God, we shall die; Go thou</hi> therefore <hi>near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say, and come and speak thou it unto us, and we will hear it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. and God hearing the People say thus, said unto <hi>Moses, they have well spoken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Stand thou therefore here, and I will speak to thee all the Statutes and Judgments which thou shalt teach them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. God betrusted <hi>this Treasure in Earthen Vessels,</hi> not Heavenly, (as it is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.) because we are not able to behold the Angels. You see how the Sons of Men have always trembled when they appeared. And further, we should have been apt to Worship them, as <hi>John</hi> would have done, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 8. And therefore God appointed Men like our selves to be the Instruments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 1. See here the necessity of this Ordinance, so as to attend upon it, waiting upon God in the Dispensation of it, for the Conversion of thy Soul. <hi>A necessity lies on me,</hi> (says <hi>Paul) to Preach the Gospel.</hi> Now that necessity of his Duty was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon another necessity; Namely, That it was a means to save the Souls of Men, whom God had committed unto him. As for such as are already Converted, I shall not need to urge upon them the necessity of this Ordinance; they have one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:154381:156"/> who will do it. If they should but want a few Meals of their appointed Food, there is a New Creature within them would cry for Bread. In the first of <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. the Apostle having said, they were <hi>begotten by the word,</hi> in the next Chapter he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them, <hi>as Newborn Babes</hi> to <hi>desire the sincere Milk of the word, that they might grow thereby:</hi> As if he had said; if you be but Babes of a day old, you will desire this word by which you were begotten. Now for such as are not yet Converted, let me ask them but this one question: Do you think Salvation necessary? Yes, then so is this, <hi>(Necessitate Medii)</hi> for (says the Apostle) it is <hi>the power of God unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> But you will say, God's power can save me by other means, if he will. I deny it not; but see what <hi>James</hi> says, (Jam. 1. 18.) <hi>Of his own will begat he us, with the word of Truth.</hi> He that out of his good pleasure begets us, out of the same free will hath chosen this means, even the word of Truth to do it by. You see the power of God engaged in it; (it is <hi>his power unto Salvation:)</hi> And you see his Will also in it; <hi>of his own Will begat he us with the word of Truth.</hi> But you will yet say (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.) <hi>Have we not all heard?</hi> I have heard Sermons enough already, if they would do me any good: Yes; (God be thanked) <hi>their Sound is gone out into all the World.</hi> But let me ask you another question, which the Apostle asks in the former words; have all you that have heard, <hi>obeyed the Gospel?</hi> Hast thou had Faith wrought, has thy Heart and Life been changed, as yet, by this word heard? the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles who were better Preachers than we, yet, cry out (as <hi>Isaiah</hi> once) <hi>who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our Report?</hi> And if thou be one of the Members yet unchanged, thou hast as much need to attend to the word, as if thou hadst never heard it; that so thou mayst escape that Damnation, and <hi>fiery vengance</hi> that will befall them who <hi>obey not the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Jesus Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 8. But you may haply say, I have knowledge enough already, and as much as the Preacher can teach me; and may not that work suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently in me to put me upon practice? Suppose this, that thou couldest not encrease in knowledge, yet thou maist as yet <hi>not know any thing as thou ought to know;</hi> and this plea is a sign of it, and so made by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. And tho' thou maist have knowledge <hi>in Salvation,</hi> and the matters of it, yet <hi>not to Salvation,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle distinguisheth it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. for such a knowledge must be by a New work of the Holy Ghost, whom we receive by Preaching of the word; Galat. 3. 2. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ye not the Spirit, by the hearing of Faith?</hi> All thy Notions may lie as dry Gunpowder Barrell'd up in thee; but what shall give fire to them, and enflame thy Heart by them; but a being <hi>a-new Baptized with the Holy Ghost, as with Fire,</hi> and by his striking some spark and good Motion in? Now the Holy Ghost falls on Men at these Ordinances. Preaching is therefore called <hi>The Ministration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. When a Pill lies dead in a Man's Body, and works not; then Physitians use to prescribe another, which often sets all a working. So after all the Sermons thou hast heard, thou hast need hear again, to make all effectual to thee. Again: When saving knowledge is once begun in thee, it receiveth daily encrease by the Preaching of the Word, even then when Notional knowledge doth not. That is, suppose thou hearest no new Truths discovered, but the same again and again; yet in the things Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by those Notions, thou maist get a further and more clear and distinct insight every time thou hearest them. Thou maist grow up into <hi>more Riches of assurance of the knowledge</hi> of those Truths thou knowest, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 2. and thou mayest grow up to more comfort, and joy in those Truths. <hi>Paul</hi> desired still to Preach to them (although converted) for <hi>the furtherance of the joy of their Faith.</hi> Tho' many promises belong to thee, and thou already knowest them, and distinctly rememberest them, and daily viewest them; yet thou mayest haply not have much peace from them: But when thou hearest them again, delivered in this Ordinance, thou may'st have such peace from them: For <hi>God Creates the fruit of the Lips; peace,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 19. And this is a thing to be added to thy knowledge, and therefore is said to be Created: And how, but by the Lips of Men uttering it? It is therefore called <hi>the fruit of the Lips.</hi> As for Example; thou knowest that thou art to be justified only by Christ's Righteousness; and thou knowest all that can be said to manifest the Truth of it, and nothing more can be added to thy Notion about it. Yet, for all this, the Apostle says, that <hi>this Righteousness is Revealed in the Preaching of the Gospel, from Faith to Faith, (Rom.</hi> 1. 17.) that is, from one degree of Faith to another. This may be Revealed with more evidence to Faith, to draw thy Heart to trust more perfectly in it. Again: Thou knowest all the particular Branches of the Law; thou
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:154381:157"/> hast <hi>a form of Truth,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, 2 <hi>Rom.</hi> 20. that is, a Platform and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the sins which the Law forbids, and Duties which the Law commands: Yet when this is again taught thee out of the word, a new light may come in, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to thee those sins which thou never as yet sawest before; a light which may <hi>divide between the Marrow and the Bones,</hi> and Anatomize thy Heart unto thee, and shew thee some new Vein or Artery, which thou never yet sawest. In and through Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying the Secrets of Mens Hearts use to be discovered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 25. So that thy experimental applying, and saving knowledge of the things themselves may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, although thy Notions be not. For tho' the Glass thou still lookest in be the same, yet thy light may be new and different; and so thou mayest come to see the Beauty or Deformity of the things Represented in it; which is the difference between saving knowledge, and that which is not such.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Apostle having mentioned in the <hi>7th</hi> verse, the variety of Gifts given by Christ under the New Testament, enlargeth himself about them.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. By shewing the Author of those Gifts, Christ, according as was Prophecyed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10.</item>
                     <item>2. By Enumerating the variety of those gifts, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.</item>
                     <item>3. The ends of those Gifts, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13, 14.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. The Author of those gifts set forth, that his Person is God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Thou the Lord God;</hi> for none but God could have given them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then it is declared, what he did for the bestowing them. 1. He Descended. 2. He Ascended. He Descended and Ascended. The Apostle argues his Descending from that word Ascending: So <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>Now that he Ascended, what is it but that he also Descended into the lower parts of the Earth?</hi> Psal. 139. 15. He improves that Scripture against the <hi>Jews</hi> to Demonstrate, that the <hi>Messiah</hi> must be humbled and laid low. He gathers a Doctrine from a word, as we use to do.</p>
                  <p>And from this observes. 1. <hi>That before God Exalts, he Humbleth.</hi> The Text says, <hi>first he Descended.</hi> Thus did God with his own Son, and so with us, as with <hi>David, Joseph,</hi> and any other whom he employs. And therefore humble your selves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may lift you up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Observe, <hi>That Christ Descended to the lowest, and Ascended to the highest place,</hi> as those two Phrases import. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>to the lower parts of the Earth:</hi> And his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension is an high, <hi>far above all Heavens,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is <hi>Super Supra, above all beings above.</hi> The Descending was into the lower parts of the Earth, the ascending far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Heavens. By his Descending, is meant that emptying himself spoken of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. For oppositely the fruit of it is made <hi>the filling all things,</hi> Christ was full of all, and God emptyed him He condescends to behold things here below, <hi>Psal.</hi> 113. but to come down below is more. And in that Phrase, <hi>the lower parts of the Earth,</hi> he Names the first and last step of his Descending: Not from Heaven to Earth only, nor to live on Earth only.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It imports to be enclosed in the dark Dungeon of the Womb, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 15. so the Womb is called, and there to be hid nine Months: 'Tis an Allusion to curious Workmen, that work within doors their most curious works.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It imports to be laid in the Grave, to be killed and buried, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 40. The Son of Man shall lie in the Heart of the Earth three days: Not in Hell, the place of the Damned, as the Papists would have it, but in the Grave which is called the Heart of the Earth. As <hi>Tyre</hi> is said to be in the Heart of the Sea, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 27. which yet was a City near the Sea-side, from both these places, the Womb and Grave, Christ was raised, and the same Body that had lain in these two places and Dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:154381:157"/> the same, says the Text, ascends far above the Heavens, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is above, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is added, that is, <hi>above above,</hi> above all Heavens; that is, Angels who are called Heavens (as the Devils are called the Gates of Hell, that is, the powers of Hell, for Magistrates Satin the Gates) so <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. He is said to be made higher than the Heavens, that is in his Person excelling all Creatures, (so <hi>Ephes.</hi> 21. His Ascending is interpreted to be far above all principalities and powers, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> Tho' 'tis true also, he is above all Heavens for place; for tho' in Heaven, yet his Throne is Conspicuous there eminently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> You see that to be much abased by God, is the way to greatest glory. Fear it not, the lower the Soul is laid in Distress, the more Comfort at last. The lower the Ebb, the greater the Flood.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. His Descent was so low, as none would ever think, that had seen him in his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>basement, it were the same Man who is now exalted. He Descended so low into so mean a condition, that when you shall see him so glorious, you would never think that That Man should have been on the Cross. Therefore <hi>verse</hi> 10. the Apostle says, it is the same Person, and that he who Descended, is the same that Ascended. And so the same Bodies that were miserable here, shall Rise again and be glorified. 'Twill be such an infinite glory, that Men will hardly believe they are the same Men. Know, says <hi>Peter,</hi> That this same Jesus, whom ye have Crucified, God hath made both Lord and Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Observe the manner of his Ascending, 'tis in a way of Triumph: He leads Captivity Captive. Enemies being conquered. Princes use to go in their Chariots Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly, when from a great Journey they come again to their own City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 6, 7, 8. Awake (says he) <hi>in thine anger, so shall the Congregation encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass thee about</hi> (that as a Conqueror, for he alludes to the manner of Soldiers in the Field, that encompass their Lord General) for their sake return then on High, as a Conqueror: Ascend gloriously. And the leading Captivity Captive is but to lead the Enemies Captive, for the Abstract is put for the Concrete; for so 'tis used, <hi>Jud. c.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 1.</p>
                  <p>Now then, 5. His end in ascending, as in descending was, 1. General, 2. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. General: <hi>That he might fill all things:</hi> 1. All places, Heaven and Earth, and therefore he comes into both; as a King that takes possession of all his Dominions. 2. That he might fill all Persons he hath ascended, as the Sun to fill all with Light to the top of Honour. 3. This is made the fruit of Christ's descending, as well as his ascending. He became poor, that we might be Rich, he became empty, that we might be filled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Second end of his Ascension is special, <hi>viz.</hi> the bestowing Gifts. To this end both this Ascending and Descending is here brought in, for both these were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the bestowing these Gifts on Men; he must both Descend and Ascend. 'Ere Christ could give Gifts to Men, he must purchase them. Your Church Officers cost Christ his Death, and Christ gave away himself first, to give these to you, and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed himself to fill you. And to answer to both these, the Phrase the Psalmist useth concerning the Gifts bestowed, signifies both his buying of them, and giving of them; and it is besides Translated there by our Translators, <hi>Received Gifts.</hi> 1. It signifies to buy or purchase <hi>Emere,</hi> so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies, and is so used. <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 16. And 2. It signifies to give or bestow: So usually in the Hebrew, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 32. 13. <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 2.) It is meant to take and bring an Offering. So then Christ's Descending was to buy these Gifts, his Ascending to receive and give them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may consider the variety of these Gifts. 1. Extraordinary. 2. Ordinary; they are here jumbled together, (also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9, 10.) And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because the Ministry in respect of the essential things, is the same now that it was then, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.) Therefore Christ blessed them, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 28. 20.) as God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed all Men at first in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Now if we know which Gifts are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and which are not; by this we shall know.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What ordinary Gifts remain, what ordinary necessities are still in the Church. We find Gifts of Teaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Governing, and Bowels of Mercy still: But no Gifts of Apostles, Evangelists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> remain. Miracles, Infallibility, and foretelling things as Prophets, (so as <hi>Agabus</hi> was) are ceased; but Gifts of Teaching and Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remain. Now God continues no Gifts in vain.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:154381:158"/> 1. The power of Apostles ceaseth, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 2. When <hi>James</hi> was Slain, there was none appointed in his room, but Elders were appointed in each Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. The Election of one in <hi>Judas</hi> his place, was in conformity to the <hi>Patriarchs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prophets are Extraordinary, for so they are Ranked, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> were separated. So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. Agabus, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 28, 29. and <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 9, 10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Evangelists they had their Calling not immediate, but from the Apostles, as they from Christ, by laying on of Hands. These were to perfect the work that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and to settle the Churches, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. nor were they confined to any place, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. <hi>In every City,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ends of these Gifts are two. 1. General, Ephes. 4. 12. <hi>For the perfecting of the Saints. For the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. More Special, <hi>ver.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>The General Ends are three,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conversion, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>for joynting in the Members.</hi> He had compared, <hi>(ver.</hi> 4.) the whole Church to a Body, (as also <hi>ver.</hi> 16.) and every Saint that belongs to that Body unto a Member. The Members of which Body are loosened, cut off, scattered one from another, and from the Head, whilst they remain unconverted to God, and separated from Christ. And the Fruit and Success of Ministers labour, is to bring all these scattered Members into the right place in the Body, fore-ordained to them by God. By Saints, here he means the Elect uncalled: For he speaks of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, as in distinction from growth. Joynting in, is bringing in the Members to the Body, Edification is building them up. Who because they are chosen to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before him in love, afore the World was, <hi>(Ephes.</hi> 1. 4.) they are by Anticipation called Saints, and aforehand entituled by what they shall be, as young, great H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rs are Stiled Lords of the places they shall have. They are called also Christ's Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 10. 16. Sheep, not yet brought into the Fold, are Tearmed Sheep. So the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> not yet Converted, and so not God's People, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10.) are tearm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Election and Anticipation, the People of God, Acts 18. 10. <hi>I have much People in this City, yet to be called.</hi> Thus the Elect of God in an Age afterwards to come unborn, are called our Brethren, and Fellow-Servants, Rev. 6. 11. <hi>And white Robes were given unto every one of them, and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little Season, untill their Fellow-Servants also, and their Brethren that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.</hi> He speaks to the Saints in Heaven in one Age, and of a persecution to come in an after Age, <hi>viz:</hi> Of the Saints to be killed by the <hi>Arrian</hi> or <hi>Anti-Christian</hi> persecution, that was long after to come. Thus also Christ calls his whole Body of Elect, to whom the benefit of his Death should extend, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Converted, or yet to be Converted: He calls them the Saints on Earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 2, 3. <hi>John</hi> 12. 19, 20. I pray not for these Apostles alone (says Christ) but for them that shall believe through their word, namely in all Ages. And the thing prayed for, was <hi>Sanctifie them through thy Truth.</hi> So then since the Elect though unconverted, yet by Conversion are made Saints; he therefore Tearms their Conversion here, the joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the Saints. Take it thus.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God had given from everlasting to Jesus Christ as an Head, a Company of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Mankind ordained to make a Body to him, and such are their Names and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Represented to him. They were, and are in God's and Christ's account viewed, as set all together in one, as they shall be at the last day. But by the fall of Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sin, the Members of all this Body are actually and in themselves loosened and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved from Christ; and every Joynt and Member of that Body, that by fore-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was set in its proper Place, Seat, and Socket in the Body, is now rent and torn from the Body, and one from another. Even as the Bones of Men dead are in a charnel House. Now then Ministers are appointed by God to be in their Ministry, the means of Converting Men, and to gather them into one, and to set each Elect Saint in his Right Seat and Socket of this Body. Which, <hi>(Acts</hi> 2. 47.) is called adding to the Church, such as should be saved. Even as the Angels Ministry at the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shall be to gather the Elect from all the four winds, such is the work of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters now. Neither is this spoken of gathering Members to a particular Church, but is meant of the Church Universal, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse.</hi> Hence then learn, that Ministers are to employ their Gifts and Ministry for Conversion of them without, as well as to build up the Saints of their particular
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:154381:158"/> charge, even Pastors and Teachers are to mind this; for you see, they are thereunto appointed. Neither can, or should any particular Church engross the Gifts of their Ministers to their own use only, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 19. The Angel of the Lord that set them at liberty, said to them; <hi>Go and stand, and speak in the Temple to the People, all the words of this Life. To the People, i. e.</hi> The common sort unconverted, and chose out the most publick place wherein to do it, <hi>viz.</hi> That of the Temple, the place where the <hi>Jews</hi> met. And Christ used to Preach there, <hi>John</hi> 18. 20. And they were bidden to Preach to them, not such Truths only, that may serve to build up the Converted; <hi>but all the words of this Life,</hi> that tend to Conversion, as well as Edification. And they practised accordingly, <hi>ver.</hi> 42. And therefore Saints Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and gathered into a Church, should not think those Truths dead and dry that tend to Convert, to discover to Men their natural Estate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they tend to quicken Men dead, to enlighten the Elect ordained to be Saints, and to joynt them into Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 2. And 2. Learn that Ministers are in a true and proper Sense, and for some ends Ministers to them without, as well as to them within. You see here Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors and Teachers are as such, as well as <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as for edifying: The Apostles when they Preacht to Cities unconverted, as <hi>Athens, Corinth, &amp;c.</hi> were they not Apostles to them, tho' the People owned them not as such, nor knew of it? Yet in the Tendency and Ordination of their Office, they were such to them, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and where-ever they Preached; and if they Converted them, they were much more so to them. Yea, and when they Preacht, the power and presence of God went with them as such, as well to those that were to be Converted, as to those that were Unconverted to turn them, 1 Cor. 9. 2. <hi>If I be not an Apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: For the Seal of mine Apostleship are ye in the Lord.</hi> And God owned me, and lookt at me as your Apostle, when his power accompanied me as such, in turning you to God. Now what is there said of an Apostle (who was sent to Preach in several places) is true of Pastors and Teachers in their Circle, Sphere and place where they are called to Preach. They Preach as Ministers to them without (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they acknowledge them or not) as well as to their own Flock. And God look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them as Men set apart to the Gospel, he accompanies them with the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of a Minister, and useth them rather than others, to Convert more generally and more frequently. And tho' they have not that obligation for watching, or power to Censure, Admonish, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet as to Preaching, which is an Ordinance of Conversion, they have. <hi>Paul</hi> as an Apostle, had not power of Censure over those that were without, 1 Cor. 5. 12. <hi>What have I to do to judge them that are without?</hi> No, not as an Apostle, had he such a power, yet to Preach to them he had, and that as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. And therefore it is neither on the one hand a right Assertion to say, that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, when they Preach to others than their own Church; are therein, and as to them to be considered, but as private Men, Gifted Brethren, for God considers them as more, and blesseth them as Ministers; and hath as well ordained them as Pastors, to joynt in the Elect Saints, as to build up. Neither is it on the other side a true Assertion; That because they are Ministers in Preaching to other Congregations that hear them; that therefore they may challenge power of Censure and Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over many Congregations. The Truth lies in the midst.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other end of the Ministry is, as to joynt in the Persons Elect, and to make the number compleat <hi>Extensive:</hi> So to build up, and to be a means of growth unto them that are within; and so <hi>Intensive</hi> to increase their Graces, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. When Men are Converted, they yet want building up to an appointed measure (which yet they know not, but God) without which they should not be saved, no more than if not Converted they should not. <hi>Except ye be Converted,</hi> (says Christ) <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little Children, ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Matth.</hi> 18. 3. He speaks to Men Converted. Now he hath appointed the Word of his Grace to bring them to that measure, as well as to Convert; it is for building up of the Body. That word is added, as in Distinction from that former; First, Men must be brought into the Body by a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, then built up. The Natural Body after it hath all its Members formed, then 'tis nursed. The Ministry serves for both, the 13 verses tells us, that the Members are to grow up to a measure of Stature, which is Christ's fulness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 23. Now unto a perfection, a fulness of Body.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:154381:159"/> 1. There must be a fulness, a compleatness of all Members or Parts; so as none may be wanting; and to this serves Conversion to joynt in the Members, and for this the Ministry is appointed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There must be a fulness of Degrees, and proportionable growth. There must be no Writhen Member; and tho' one be smaller than the other, as the little finger is to the rest; yet it must arrive to it's Stature; and the Stature of each is appointed by God. And when the whole Workmanship appears, and all is set together, there is an infinite Beauty. And to cause them each to grow up, thereto the Ministry serves. Or if you will take the other Metaphor of building, as an Allusion to an House supposed to be made up of Living Stones, as those are, 1 Pet. 2. 5. <hi>Ye also as lively Stones, are built up a Spiritual House, an Holy Priesthood to offer up Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</hi> As suppose there were an House built of such Stones, having life and growth as the Body of Man hath, which being laid on a Foundation, did of themselves grow up into an House, there would be in such a case; 1. The plaining of the Stone in the Foundation, as in it's proper place, and 2. The growth of the Stones to such a proportion, as should make a comely build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now such an House are the Saints, Ephes. 2. 20, 21. <hi>And are built upon the Foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner Stone. In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> Now then, Conversion is a building us on the Foundation, a laying us in the building: And growth in Grace is our growing up together into that comely Structure of the whole, and both are accomplisht by the Ministry.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third general end or use of Pastors and Teachers, is the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry: This is usually taken, as brought in between both to shew; 1. That it is a work or calling of Labour <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. And 2. Of Service, not Lordship. But I take it rather as noting out the whole work of their Calling, and the whole work of their Ministration, which is the immediate end of their Office, as their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and which tends to those two other ends that follow thereon, through God's blessing thereupon, <hi>viz.</hi> that Men are Converted and Edified. And so all particulars of it, as Preaching, Administration of Sacraments, Prayer, are included, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 4. And thus it imports certain works to be performed by them, that make up the proper special calling of a Man set apart to it. It is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, 'tis the work of Service, as the word signifies. When <hi>James, Paul,</hi> and other Apostles, stile themselves Servants of Christ, they intend it not in that Sense, wherein all Christans are Servants, but they intend their being, as Menial Houshold-Servants, that have a proper constant work every day assigned them. As Officers and Courtiers write themselves Servants to the King in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and not as other Subjects. Therefore a Minister is stiled by this, as a Name more proper to him, <hi>The Servant of God,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24. <hi>Set apart to this work,</hi> Gal. 1. 16. Rom. 1. 1, 2. <hi>An Apostle separated,</hi> and therefore, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. He calls the very Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice a work, because it should be his whole work. <hi>He that desires the Office of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, desires a worthy work;</hi> and Chap. 4. 15. <hi>Give thy self wholy to them.</hi> It requires the whole Man, let him that Exhorts, be in Exhortation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 12. 8. <hi>Totus in illo,</hi> Let him make it his calling, and Meditate on these things, and make them his Study. He must be a Scribe instructed, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 13. 52.) that by long use and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, and experience of himself and others, hath a Treasure of old Coin and of new, a Stock of Coin laid up, and an importation of new Bullion, <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 6. He was a ready Scribe in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> which the Lord God of <hi>Israel</hi> had given; and the King granted him all his Requests, according to the Hand of the Lord his God upon him. He was a ready Scribe verst in't; and <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Ezra</hi> had prepared his Heart, to seek the Law of the Lord, and to do it; and to Teach in <hi>Israel,</hi> Statutes and Judgments. He prepared his Heart to study it; and to seek out the meaning, and to Teach it, and he did nothing else in comparison. And <hi>(ver.</hi> 9.) The good Hand of God was with him. You will e're long, come to find that blessing in Men set apart to it, as to a Calling; that is not in all the Gifts of Brethren, that occasionally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The more especial ends of the Ministry are;</p>
                  <p>1. Positive. 2. Preventive.</p>
                  <p>1. Positive, the preserving them in, and growing up to the unity of the Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. Preventive, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="315" facs="tcp:154381:159"/> 1. Positive growth in Knowledge and Faith, which is the cause of all other growth, and which Pastors and Teachers should take care of, Jer. 3. 15. <hi>And I will give you Pastors according to mine Heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding;</hi> that is, Wisdom Practical and Spiritual. God hath taken care, and made provision for the Instruction of his People in the Faith and Knowledge, and set apart Men, whose Callings should be to perfect them therein; for which private Prophecying is not sufficient. As in Universities and Colledges; 'tis an ample provision, that young Students have not only publick Acts which themselves perform, and what by private Study and Conference they get; but they have Tutors, and Professors set apart to make it their Employment to Read to them. God hath taken the same care, he would not have his Children Read to <hi>ex tempore;</hi> but they have Men that are as Scribes instructed in the Law; and in a Church, Pastors and Teachers are as Tutors to their Understanding and Affections, to Read constantly, and on purpose to both these ends, and to improve them in knowledge specially; which is therefore alone men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; because if it be Spiritual, it works upon the Affections. For if you grow in true Spiritual Knowledge, you will grow in Grace, 2 Pet. 3. 18. <hi>But grow in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to him be Glory, &amp;c.</hi> The Church is under Age, Children, as <hi>ver.</hi> 13. not yet come to Stature. And as Great Men have Tutors for their Children in their Travel to perfect their understandings, and observe their Manners: So hath God betrusted his Church in their Pilgrimage with Ministers, whose work and calling it is to Read to you. God accounts the Training up of his Children, as great a matter as you do yours; and therefore hath not left them to the common care one of another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Those words, <hi>until,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. Which notes out the Duration, have a double Sense: 1. It means, Age after Age. The Church is instructed more and more in Truths, and their Judgments by the Ministry of all Ages are so cleared, that in the end, through the help of their Ministers, all differences will be ended; and they will have one Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and be one Man of one Mind. 2. Or it signifies there, being one Foundation of Faith necessary to Salvation, even as one Body (as <hi>ver.</hi> 4.) And these Saints being to come forth in several Ages Successively, which Ages are to last till the day of Judgment; the use and duration of the Ministry, is to last and continue until all those Saints in every Age, come and arrive at this unity of the Fundamentals of Faith, and in the true knowledge of the Son of God, which as necessary to Salvation, God hath ordained; so as it shall be found true of all the Saints at the latter Day, that they all had the same unity of Faith. And the Ministry is to last therefore, until this be performed. And truly, if we look over all Stories, we find down all along, that God hath performed this promise in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, which is still Truth enough to save Men, though the light indeed in these latter days in other things is so cleared, that in denying and gainsaying, sin against light, and so are lost, though otherwise they had Truth enough to save them. So that this word <hi>until,</hi> doth not simply note out that one full <hi>Terminus</hi> or Period of perfection, that shall be at the latter Day, and not until then be accomplisht. (For it cannot well be judged, how at the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and in Heaven, there is the unity of the Faith, where Faith ceaseth) but it serves to note out what was to be a-doing all the time along in every Age. The Emphasis being put upon the word [all] who coming in a Succession into the World, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry must, as a means hereof, continue until <hi>[all]</hi> come to the same <hi>unity.</hi> And so the meaning is, that the Ministry is needful, that they all might Arrive and be found to have the same Faith, and to have arrived to that Stature here, who appearing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the latter day, make up Christ's fulness. There are common principles and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of all Saints in all Ages; as to instance in that one, 1 Pet. 1. 1. Simon Peter <hi>a Servant and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like pretious Faith with us, through the Righteousness of God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ.</hi> There is an unity in the Faith, and that would we have made the Standard for Liberty and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not to dispense therein. And we may acknowledge this to the Honour of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and Synods, that this we should have lost, if it had not been for Ministers and Counsels.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Ministry is necessary to prevent Errors and Mischiess, to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:154381:160"/> 1. He shews the danger of Saints without Officers. 1. They are as Children, the ordinary sort of them, who are easie to be deceived, to take Counters for Gold. </p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are as Ships at Sea, either riding at Anchor, or such whose Anchor is apt to be broken, and they exposed to be tost in both cases.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If they lye at Anchor in the main Sea; yet if a Storm come, they are exposed to the fury of the Waves, and to be tost this way and that way, and to a being unstea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not knowing what to hold. This the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> imports, to be carried round about.</p>
                  <p>Or 2. If their Anchor break, then they are liable to float, and be driven any way on Rocks, Heresies and the like, and so to make Shipwrack of Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Do you use to commit your Ships you have but Merchandize in, unto ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Saylors? No, but to Men specially Skilled, to Pilot them, to direct them in a Storm?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He shews the advantage which evil Teachers have to do mischief.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Many of them are Men, which is spoken oppositely to the generality of Saints, who are but Children, and these as Men, can wind and cheat Children as they please. There had need therefore be those that are Men too, and Men of God to encounter them, that have their Senses exercised to discern good and evil, as Heb. 6. 13, 14▪ <hi>For every one that useth Milk, is unskilful in the word of Righteousness; for he is a Babe. But strong Meat belongeth to them that are of full Age, even those who by reason of use, have their Senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</hi> Such are necessary, who are able <hi>to convince Gain-sayers,</hi> that have depths of knowledge to answer the depths of Satan.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He says, they are Masters of their Art, which is Jugling, and casting false Dice, who can cheat, as Men at Dice and Cards. They can pack Scriptures, so as they shall appear for their cause; they have that slight of Hand, as to deceive your Eye; and you have need of them that should discover them, and their Jugling Tricks, which being once discovered, are the most plain and easie to be avoided.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are High-way-side-Men, that come stealing on you by degrees; and then with Violence Surprise (as having Judgment in an Ambushment) one Opinion shall draw on another cunningly, till being wound in, and encompassed about, you must needs yield. Now if the use and end of the Ministry is to be as a preservative from a Bank and Wall of opposition against these: Then whilst you see such as these Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to continue in the Church (as in these times you do, and they have abounded) and perceive the Saints still as apt to be deceived; there must needs be acknowledged, the remaining and continuance of this Ministry, and the necessity thereof, as there will be to the end of the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 1. See and consider the greatness of the Benefit and Favour of God, vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed in these Donations of Ministers and Officers to his Church. Which is discovered out of the Text in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a Gift, and pretious Gift every way. A Gift not for <hi>Jehovah</hi> only, or his Worship, (although in that respect, they are said to be a Gift for the Lord, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 6.) But it is withal added, <hi>To you</hi> they are given as a Gift; so here says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, they are Gifts to Men; and consider the particulars. 1. The Gifts or inward abilities the Men have: How Rich and Pretious are they? It is a Rich Treasure, tho' in Earthen Vessels. 2. To ordain the Officers suited to these Gifts, the Administrations as well as the Gifts; these are from the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. As Numb. 18. 7. <hi>I have given the Priests Office, as a Service of Gift.</hi> God looks upon the Ordination of the Office it self, as a Gift. 3. That he should in his providence to our days, through the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Ascension raise up Men thus Gifted, to supply his Church withal; this is more than that Covenant made to <hi>Noah</hi> of, that Harvest and Spring shall not cease for ever. And 4. God gives them his Holy Spirit, inclining their Spirits to undertake this Service (so contemned in the World) so willingly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are the Gifts bequeathed us at Christ's Ascension. And so they his last Gifts, whereby he would express his love; as <hi>Eliah</hi> at his Ascending, let fall his Mantle; which with a double portion of his Spirit went. Yea, they are the Fruits, not only of Christ's Ascension, but of his Descending also; and that must be a matter of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Moment; for the effecting which, Christ must take such a Journey backward and forward, from Heaven to Earth, and then to Heaven again.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:154381:160"/> 3. The Donative is great, in respect of the Blessing which God follows all these with. Indeed the Apostle mentions it not; but in citing it, referreth to all that the <hi>Psalm</hi> speaks of it. Now <hi>(Psal.</hi> 68. 19.) It is there added, he Ascended to give or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Gifts for Men, <hi>that he might dwell among them.</hi> It fills up the Allusion to an House, when Christ Ascended, he became absent, going into a far Country; but to the end he might visit them with his Spirit, and Spiritual Presence. He first builds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an House on Earth. (I will build my Church, says Christ) and then he furnisheth it with all sorts of Officers and Furniture; and when 'tis thus compleated, he comes down into it, and dwells in it, and delights to do so; and he there keeps open House for all comers. That Exhortation <hi>(Colos.</hi> 3. 16.) <hi>Let the word of God dwell richly in you,</hi> is spoken to them as a Church, <hi>(ver.</hi> 15.) 'Tis an Allusion to God's keeping House a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Saints, and he loves they should fare richly and deliciously, and feast all that would come in among them, which is done by Gifts of Officers specially. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites him to come and Sup and dwell with them. For so it runs, <hi>He gave or received Gifts, that he might dwell.</hi> Not but that he dwelt in these Saints afore: But much more now, when he finds all his Houshold-Servants about him to attend him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Donative appears to be great from the ends thereof, which are every way full; for both extensively they serve to bring into him all his Members, and to make his Body compleat; and to add to his Church, such as shall be saved; and so to bring in Honour to God, which consists as a King's, in the multitude of his Subjects. And it is the Church's Honour to Encrease and Multiply, and the means of each Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's growth, is by what every one supplies. And intensively, these Officers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters do also serve to build up, and cause to grow to a full Stature (as here) every Member also, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. <hi>Paul</hi> committed to the word of God's Grace, to build them up, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it is as if he he had said, now you have Ministers among you, I make account you are setled; you want nothing but building up, until you come to Heaven, and for that I have seen you provided; And so I leave and commit you to the word of Grace.</p>

                  <p>THese words are the Close or Conclusion of a Set and Solemn Exhortation made to <hi>Timothy;</hi> and in his Person, to all that are or intend the Ministry. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation it self is continued along from the eleventh verse, to this last Period of it. The matter thereof wholy concerns that part of a Minister's Office; Preaching or Teaching, <hi>(ver.</hi> 11.) And this in distinction from Ruling the Church; of which in the next Chapter he Treats at large. And the design of the Apostle, is to give several di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and instructions to him, how to render himself a powerful and profitable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto the Salvation of himself and others, intermixt with stimulations to care and diligence in the observation of those Directions. The Directions and Instructions are reduced into two Heads; as appears both by the entrance into that part of his Discourse, <hi>(ver.</hi> 12, 13.) and then again in the conclusion of it in this verse.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He directs him to have a special care of his own Personal Converse, <hi>verse</hi> 12. <hi>Be thou an Example of the Believers in word,</hi> or good Conference or Discourse <hi>in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,</hi> or Deeds answerable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Christ Taught with Authority, and not as the <hi>Scribes.</hi> For they say, and do not, says Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He directs him to furnish himself with meet Abilities for Preaching it self, v. 13. <hi>Till I come, give attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine,</hi> Till I come: As if he should have said, until when I shall afford thee other helps by conference, and the like: I think meet to give these Instructions, which is all I can do by an Epistle. Here is first, the Preparatory part, that he must furnish him with Materials, give <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance to Reading, with Meditation and Study, (ver.</hi> 15.) Now this Reading must
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:154381:161"/> have an Object: And what that is <hi>Paul's</hi> Parallel Exhortation to the same, <hi>Timothy</hi> resolves us, 2 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Doctrine.</hi> 2. As for that which is here in one word Tearmed Exhortation; there he brancheth it forth into the particulars of it, <hi>Profitable for Reproof, Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Instruction in Righteousness. That the Man of God may be perfect;</hi> as you say he is a perfect Artist; a perfect Physitian; that is, skill'd in all these parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Requisite to that Function; in Anatomy, in Simples, in the Nature and Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Diseases, and in the cures of them. And thus he Subjoyns, explaining himself; and it is Exegetical when he says, <hi>Throughly furnished to every good work, viz.</hi> of the Ministry. As in general he Tearms it, (Eph 4. 12.) <hi>The work of the Ministry,</hi> so here he expresseth his instructions, that to every good work, that <hi>Timothy</hi> should be furnished, that is, to every business which belongs to that Function. For so in his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, it is to be Restrained, <hi>viz.</hi> to such particular work, as Doctrine Reproof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which he had mentioned, and what ever else there may be supposed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have the Executive part, wherein he reduceth the work of Preaching to two Heads. 1. Exhortation, which we call Application, provoking and stirring Men up to practice. 2. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> Teaching, Explaining, Confirming Divine Truths out of the Scriptures, in a Dogmatical way. <hi>Solomon</hi> speaking Summarily of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Synagogues (which he calls their Assemblies, which had Masters or Rulers over them; or rather (as others think) Interpreters of Sacred Scriptures, then written by himself and others, infallibly guided by one Shepherd) Thus Eccles. 12. 9. <hi>And moreover because the Preacher was Wise, he still taught the People Knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many Proverbs.</hi> He makes the same Division of the work of Preaching. The <hi>words of the Wise</hi> (says he) <hi>are as Goads pricking</hi> on to Holiness. And as <hi>Nails</hi> which rivet and fasten Truths in Men's minds, or which are as Nails to hold up and support lesser chains of Truth, that are Consequential from those that are more fundamental, and hang upon them.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi>'s Scope is, as to exhort <hi>Timothy</hi> to a Diligence in these two parts of Preaching; so in his Reading the Scriptures, to have these two parts in his Eye and Design. And therefore it is, he joyns these two with that of Reading in one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Speech; because the use he would have him make of Reading, should be still, to sort and adjust what materially in Scripture he found serving unto these two parts of Preaching, either to strengthen and thicken all sorts of Exhortation, as there should be occasion, with Testimonies of Scriptures: Or if he were to explain and confirm any Truths, to have in a readiness Scriptures to do it by: That in what he speaks, though out of never so fresh and full experience, he might not seem to speak barely as a Man; but should still produce the Scripture, speaking the same thing, as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that he did, (1 Cor. 9. 8.) <hi>Say I these things as a Man? Saith not the Law the same also?</hi> And as you have it, Acts 26. 22. <hi>Saying none other things then what the Prophets and</hi> Moses <hi>did say, should come to pass.</hi> And the Scriptures are an abundary, for all sorts of Truths and Experiences Spiritual; for Exhortations, Doctrines and Confirmations of all sorts. And when a Man speaks his own Faith and Experience▪ in the very meaning and sense of the Holy Ghost, it hath power in it; yea, his power to accompany it. <hi>If any Man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And again at the <hi>15th verse,</hi> he calls upon him to Meditate on these things. Which Speech refers (as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> says) to the things spoken, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. And therein (say I) it refers not barely or so much to the Precepts or Instructions themselves, as to the things propounded in them; Namely, the Scriptures read by him, that by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Study, he should search forth the mind of God in them; and by Industry and Intention of Mind, sort what he finds therein unto Exhortation and Doctrine; yea, and make this his Calling, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Sis totus in illis, Give thy self wholy to them.</hi> He was not to Read or Study the Scriptures, as a private Christian is bound to do, (which is his Duty and Character, Psal. 1. 2. <hi>In the Law of God, he Meditates Day and Night)</hi> but as one that is to make Provision for the Comfort, Direction, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of others, as one who is to Read to the end, he may be able to Teach, Exhort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as was observed) He is to do these things, as a Man that is separated to the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. who is as a publick Steward or Provider to a great Family, as both Christ and <hi>Paul</hi> compares the Ministers of the Gospel, Christ in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 52. <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1. A Minister therefore is to be furnished with a Treasure and a
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:154381:161"/> Stock, as Christ there speaks and compares it: And it is not his Duty to do this for a time, and then to think himself furnished enough; but he is to continue, to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in them. So in this verse, the Apostle still carrying these things in his Eye, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns him so to continue in this Study, as his profiting might appear to all, <hi>verse</hi> 15. his profiting in knowledge in the Scriptures, <hi>[Gal.</hi> 1. 14. I profited says <hi>Paul,</hi> in the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion, in the knowledge of it, and zeal for it) as well as his profiting in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. And all this concerns those who in their own intentions, have set their Hearts upon the Ministry, as the mark of their Calling, and are in preparation to it, as well as it doth concern those that actually are in the Calling of the Ministry.</p>
                  <p>Now then consider, that <hi>Paul</hi> should give these Directions and Counsels to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who had something extraordinary in his Call, it was by Prophetical Designment, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18.) The Holy Ghost setting him forth unto it by Name. Even as <hi>(Acts</hi> 13. 2.) You read that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were by Name at a Fast; and as it should seem, this our <hi>Timothy,</hi> was at a like Church-meeting at <hi>Ephesus, ver.</hi> 14. of this Chapter; at which <hi>Paul</hi> was present, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 6. And therefore he may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have had a participation of Gifts extraordinary, which was common in those times. He also had from a Child, been trained up in the Knowledge of the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. and had now, (when this was wrote) as a Preacher, been experienced long in them. Yet he calls a-fresh upon <hi>Timothy,</hi> to give attendance to Reading, Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Study; and to give himself together with Preaching wholy unto these things. What pretence then can there be, either that the Ministry, or the Preparation to the Ministry, is not now in our days as a Calling, with Labour and Study, as other Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, to be attained?</p>
                  <p>There is a Generation of Men, that are against acquired knowledge, or that which is sought out by Study, or received from others, and would have all infused. Now consider that <hi>Timothy</hi> had the main and chief of his knowledge this way, 2 Tim. 3. 14. <hi>Continue in the things thou hast learned, and hast been assured of, knowing of whom tbou hast learned them,</hi> he had learned them of <hi>Paul. Paul</hi> indeed himself, had it by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> Gal. 1. 14. <hi>I indeed,</hi> (says <hi>Paul) had the Gospel by</hi> Revelation: I neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it of Man, neither was I taught it, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which was my special priviledge. <hi>Revelation</hi> is there opposed unto two other ways of knowing Divine Truth. 1. By Tradition, which is receiving it from Man; as most do their Religion. 2. By instruction, and Teaching as <hi>Paul</hi> Taught <hi>Timothy,</hi> and this is the way of ordinary Christians and Professors, and hinders not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, by Faith or Experience. For so <hi>Paul</hi> there tells us, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had been assured of them, and yet Taught; and <hi>Timothy</hi> was by Teaching, to propagate them to other Teachers, 2 Tim. 2. 2. <hi>And the things that thou hast heard of me among many Witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful Men, who shall be able to teach others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</hi> And this may be had from Men's Writings, as well as <hi>ore tenus,</hi> by word of Mouth, witness <hi>Paul</hi>'s both Books and Parchments, 2 Tim. 4. 13. <hi>The Cloak that I left at</hi> Troos <hi>with</hi> Carpus, <hi>when thou comest bring with thee, and the Books, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Parchments.</hi> Books were those of other Mens Writings, and Parchments his own (which he therefore put a mark especially upon) his own <hi>excerpta,</hi> or notes gathered out of others: Or because, if he had a <hi>Revelation,</hi> he might forget it, he had therefore his Memorials in Writing. Yea, <hi>that</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

Jeremiah</hi> had the Prophecy by <hi>Revelation;</hi> but the accomplishment <hi>Daniel</hi> understood by Records, and so set himself to Fast: And God Recompensed his Diligence in the search of this with a <hi>Revelation</hi> of a more happy Period, the coming of Christ in the Flesh, at the Close of that day's Fast. And what says our Saviour Christ also? Mat. 13. 52. <hi>Every Scribe which is instructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, is like a Man that is an Housholder, which bringeth forth out of his Treasure, things new and old.</hi> 1. He speaks of Ministers of the New Testament, who are instructed or furnished for the Kingdom of Heaven. And yet, 2. He gives them the same Title which they had under the Old, <hi>viz. Scribes.</hi> For in this res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, their calling and work is much alike, as also the means of attaining knowledge, Matth. 23. 34. <hi>I send unto you Prophets, Wise Men and Scribes,</hi> (says Christ) speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:154381:162"/> of the Preaching of the Gospel. Of <hi>Ezra</hi> it is said, Ezra 7. 6. <hi>He was a ready Scribe in the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>which the Lord had given. Ready,</hi> some read it <hi>diligent,</hi> as that which had made him ready, so you have it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 29. A Man diligent in his business. And <hi>Ezra</hi> 7. 10. it was added, <hi>That</hi> Ezra <hi>had prepared his Heart, to seek the Law of the Lord;</hi> that is, had set himself with all his might, to find out the meaning of it, and to do it, and to Teach in <hi>Israel</hi> Statutes and Judgments. 3. Christ in that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 52. means, that they are to be furnished with a store and Treasure of knowledge, laid up aforehand, and ready at hand; and 4. That they should have the knowledge of former Ages, and so bring forth things old, as well as new Truths observed in present times: And therefore <hi>Decreta Prudentum, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Interpretations of other Ages and Persons are to be consulted.</hi> For though Christ hath promised, that what ever Secret is in the Scriptures, shall be uttered and known openly, and upon the House tops, <hi>(Mark</hi> 4. 21, 22.) yet his promise is not, that every one shall be in any one Age only; but he doth this Successively, and in one Age one Secret is discovered, that was not afore. One Age Sows, and another Reaps, <hi>(John</hi> 4. 36, 37.) and day instructs night, and night day, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. Which passages in that <hi>Psalm,</hi> the Apostle interprets of the Teachings and Writings of Apostles and Ministers, that go forth into all the World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10▪ 18. The darkest night in Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as it received and retained much light from <hi>Augustine,</hi> whose Writings preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Foundations in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and his light as the day of the Primitive Times, hath Transmitted and Taught us this in this day of the Gospel, many Truths which otherwise we should have been to seek in. And answerably the Apostle, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4.) tell us; that from the time of Christ's Ascension, Pastors and Teachers should Teach the whole Universal Church to come, to the end of the World, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. which could not be, did not the Ministry of one Age, afford and traduce down light unto another. Thruth's are Christ's currant Mony, for one Age as well as another; and some of them are stampt in one Kings Reign, others in another. If we should have had no more Silver in this Kingdom, then what was brought in our Age, how poor should we be? That is Revealed to one, that is not to another; It was so even in those times, when knowledge by <hi>Revelation</hi> was most frequent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 30. And how doth the Apostle take such Men up? <hi>What</hi> (says he) <hi>came the word of God out from you? Or came it only to you? ver.</hi> 36. as if he should have said, God hath Taught other Ages and Churches, as well as you. And you cannot say of any one, we have no need of you; that is, of your light or help, as (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.) the Apostle, to another, though like purpose, infers.</p>
                  <p>Whereas some Men are for Preaching only <hi>Extempore,</hi> and without Study, <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy</hi> Meditate, and Study, and give his mind wholy to these things. Even in writing some Scriptures, the Pen-men, though guided infallibly by the Holy Ghost, yet used Study and Meditation and Art in the contriving of them. That <hi>Psalm</hi> of <hi>Psalms, Psal.</hi> 45. that Song of Songs about Christ's Kingdom, is an evidence of this. It was a Poem, and of all other the Master-piece, and the first rude Draught of that Song of Songs, which <hi>Solomon</hi> after wrote, and the very Epitome of it. Now what is his Preface to it? <hi>My Heart is boyling up a good matter, ver,</hi> 1. (so in your Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents) it was boyled in his thoughts (as the Meat-offering in the Law with Oyl, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7. 9.) and so it was prepared by Study, to be offered up to God. <hi>I speak the things which I have made, touching the King</hi> (says the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 1.) <hi>i. e.</hi> I speak my works to the King. He calls it, as Men do their Writings, his Works; and Dedicates it as Men do works to the King. And again, <hi>Solomon</hi> that wrote the Canticles and Ecclesiastes, professeth that in Teaching the People, he gave good heed, and sought out, and set in order many <hi>Proverbs;</hi> he weighed things as in Scales, as some read it, sought them out, and set them in order; yea, and he sought to find out words that might take, <hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> 12. 9, 10. All which imports, that it did cost Study.</p>
                  <p>Yea, if it be considered, these Men who decry Learning and Study, yet do not themselves, keep to this their Law; for that sound knowledge which they have, or retain, hath been from the ministry of this Age, which hath diffused it, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole House; and yet unthankfully they set up against them, with that light they have had by Retail from them. Neither can they be said to Preach <hi>Extempore,</hi> or what is at that present Revealed; for they Preach those things which their thoughts and speeches have been exercised in before. So as ordinarily the Extemporariness is in respect of memory; for it is what comes to their memories of notions again and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:154381:162"/> again Meditated upon. The Holy Ghost may be supposed to bring to remembrance, things before considered in Study and Meditation, or reading in order to Doctrine and Exhortation in publick. And that place of Christ's, Luke 21. 14. <hi>Meditate not afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what to say,</hi> is spoken in case of Persecution, <hi>(ver.</hi> 12.) and of being brought to the Bar; which is in an extraordinary season, and so hath usually extraordinary assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: It is not spoken of ordinary Sermons in the Pulpit. And again they were ordinarily taken on the suddain; and haled away to answer presently, as Christ himself was; and so could not Premeditate, to comfort them therefore, he gives forth that promise. And again, it excludes not Premeditation; for the Christians studyed, and Studyed Apologies: But it is spoken against Anxiety, and Solicited that way, and to provoke them rather to a dependency on the Spirit to help them, though they had prepared never so much.</p>
                  <p>I shall only close this, with the very conclusion of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Ecclesiast.</hi> which hath an Admonition in it full of weight, Eccles. 12. 12. <hi>And further by these, My Son, be Admonished: Of making many Books there is no end, and much Study is a weariness of the Flesh.</hi> Concerning the Scope and Coherence of this; I observe, 1. That he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commended the Writings of Sacred Scriptures (wrote by himself and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets inspired by God immediately) unto every Man's Study and Search, he gives a Caveat and an Admonition concerning Reading and Studying too many other Books. Those words, <hi>And further by these be Admonished,</hi> seems to import only a superad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Admonition: As we use to say, <hi>over and above, and in fine, take this Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Others read it thus, <hi>Magis</hi> or <hi>potius ex his Admonitus,</hi> that is, <hi>Rather seek Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Instruction</hi> ex his, <hi>out of these Books, than others that are of Men's Writings, and Forraign to a Christian.</hi> Exercise thy self in the Study of the Scriptures, and what doth best serve to open and explain them. Others (which comes all to one) Paraphrase it thus, <hi>Amplius his, Cave quaeras, Take heed of seeking too inordinately, other Knowledge then what is in these: Or then that tendeth to explain these.</hi> Or if you will have my mind says <hi>Solomon</hi> more plainly, take heed of making or reading many other Books; for there is no end, no satisfaction in them. And besides much Study is wearisom to the Flesh, and preys upon the best of the Spirits. I observe, he doth not altogether Condemn reading other Books, or making of them, only prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others to these, or not counting these most excellent: And 2. He condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> reading too many; and 3. He finds fault with it, when it tends to decay of Health and Spirits▪ And this is to be reckoned among these Vanities, which we had cryed down as vain, and not simply unlawful, as Gardens, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not. 2. He did this in his times, when the Holy Scriptures were but few, in comparison of that access which we have had since; for <hi>David</hi> had but <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law: Yet you see how he Studyed it day and night. 3. He propounds in the Coherence of these words with the former his own example, as he had done in other things, throughout this Book. He was a Writer and Reader of many Books, perhaps the greatest in the World; and many of them were not Scriptures; but of other things; and he found it Vanity, as he had found the rest. It had took up too much of his time, and had shortned his Days. And therefore (says he) I commend to you rather my Sacred Writings, than all the other Books of mine or others in the World. And indeed the Holy Scriptures wrote by him only have remained, when the other are lost. Yea, 4. By the next words; <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments,</hi> he would insinuate, that even Study had took up too much of the Man from Piety, and keeping up Communion with God. Therefore so we should Study, as that the whole and main of our Souls, may be in the Worship of God, and doing his Will, which these Books teach you, says he, and none other. And last of all, I observe it is his last Admonition, and he reserved it to bring it in last. For 1. Learning is of all other, the best Vanity this World hath. <hi>Wisdom</hi> (says he) <hi>is better than folly,</hi> and so is apter to draw the Heart away from God, and his Holy Scriptures; and yet even this is a Vanity, says <hi>Solomon,</hi> as well as the rest. He had before concluded in general, and made an end of reckoning up any more Vanities, <hi>(ver.</hi> 8. Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity, says the Preacher) only as having forgotten one as necessary to be mentioned, as any other; he brings it in with a <hi>Furthermore</hi> (as our Translators read it) as if he had said last of all, I gave you this Admonition, to the end it may the more stick with you, <hi>Further my Son, be Admonished.</hi> And he doth it, as you have heard upon occasion of commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture too, as alone sufficient to make one wise in the fear of God, and all this is done to make the admonition more weighty and solemn.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Ministers Maintenance. Of the Right, &amp; Tenure, by which he hath a claim to it. Of the ways, and means, by which it is to be setled and raised.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IN discoursing of the maintence which is due to a Minister of the Gospel we must first consider upon what a Tenure he holds his right to it, and that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will guide us to find out by what Rule this Maintenance is to be proportioned.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Ministers of Christ under the new Testament hold their Tenure of Right to a due Maintenance, by vertue of the Laws of common Justice as are practised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men and Men in like affairs. By the same right; on which all other stipends of Places, Offices and Callings in Kindgoms, or common wealths, are founded, these sacred Officers may challenge a Maintenance due, and proper for them. As both Civil and Military Offices, as that of a Captain in war, or of a Judge, Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have a stipend from the state propotion'd according to the Rules of common Justice currant among Men, so a Minister ought to have a Maintenance from the Church, by the same Rule of Justice, suited to the dignity and Labour of his place and calling.</p>
                  <p>The Stipends of Offices in humane Governments are measured out by these Rules.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The dignity of the place is considered, and due provision is made, that the person may have an allowance sufficient to uphold the honour of his Function.</item>
                     <item>2. The expences of the Office are also rated, that the person may be furnish'd to discharge all that his being in such a place requires.</item>
                     <item>3. The Hazard which he may undergo in his Office comes also into Consideration.-</item>
                     <item>4. The Labour and pains of the places and Calling are weigh'd, and a due Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation had of them.</item>
                     <item>5. The breeding, and Education of the persons before they can be fitted for such an Office is also put into the Balance.</item>
                     <item>6. An account is made how beneficial and useful a Person in such an Office is to the Government.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>All these things in all sorts of Offices are valued among Men, by the common rate that Justice currant among men doth put upon them. And all these considerations so far as they are found in this sacred Office of the Ministry (as they are all) are by that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of common Justice, and Customs of Men in like Callings, to be regarded and this Office is to have its stipend answerably proportion'd. Now that this Calling holds upon these Tenures of Common Justice is evident, because the pleas us'd in the New Testament for the Maintenance of Christ's Ministers are founded upon this claim, and this right and Tenures are pleaded therein.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us consider the Text, 1 Cor. 9. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a Vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Say I these things as a Man? or saith not the Law the same also? For it is written in the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the Corn: Doth God take care for Oxen? Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? for our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope: and he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we should reap your carnal things? If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power: but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the Gospel of Christ. Do ye not know that they which Minister about holy things, live of the things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospel, should live of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi> Mark the instances which he brings. 1. Of Souldiers, and their places in War. 2. Of Planters of a Vineyard. 3. Of a Shepherd. And he adds this expression, <hi>Say I these things as a man?</hi> He insists on the examples and customs of Men, in the like cases, the same common Rules of Justice holding in this case, as there. And (as <hi>Pareus</hi> observes) he also pleads all sorts of Titles of Justice, which serve to strengthen the Fundamental Title. 1. He mentions the customs of men in like callings, as in that of Souldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. He takes notice what natural Justice it is, to plow and sow in hope of a crop, and to reap in hope of eating the fruits of the labour. 3. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:154381:163"/> the moral equity of the Judical Law, which forbids to muzzle the mouth of the Ox which treadeth out the Corn, and tho' it would be lawful to do so under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, yet God thereby taught a Rule of common Justice to be observed among all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Men, (for this was not a Type) and this among other things God taught by it, that in Justice a reward is due to a Labourer, since it is so to a Beast, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle herein pleads the Justice, not the Type of the thing. 4. The Apostle consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Equality of commutative Justice, and what the Laws of Exchange require that value should be given for value <hi>(verse</hi> 11.) and tho', indeed, he doth not say, <hi>Our spiritual things,</hi> as he says <hi>Tour carnal,</hi> yet he plainly expresseth that it is <hi>we</hi> who sow them. He, in justice, requires only <hi>parva pro Magnis, small things for great.</hi> For the fruits, and benefits of this calling, are to be considered, which exceed in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all carnal things whatever. 5. The Apostle takes notice of the Equity of the Ceremonial Law, <hi>verse</hi> 13, 14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other Text of Scripture to be considered is, 1 Tim. 5. 17, 18. <hi>Let the Elders that Rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the Word and Doctrine. For the Scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the Ox that treadeth out the Corn: and the labourer is worthy of his reward.</hi> 1. He speaks of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be paid to them, now Honour was a due as well as Tribute, which was exacted, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 7. And it was due in justice. 2. He tells us that <hi>the labourer is worthy of his hire;</hi> Every word which he useth, expresseth matter of Justice, 1. <hi>Labourer,</hi> This shews that, to the work, in justice the reward is to be proportioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. 2. The Apostle expresseth a worthiness of his work, that it deserves a valuable consideration, <hi>That a Labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> 3. The Apostle mentions <hi>hire,</hi> whereby he intends a Covenanted reward, such as is set by mutual agreement, so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies. 4. The words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>of his hire, i. e.</hi> which he in justice may call his</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This was also the first institution of Christ, Mat. 10. 9, 10. <hi>Provide neither Gold nor Silver, nor Brass in your purses: Nor scrip for your Journey, neither two Coats, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shooes, nor yet staves: (for the workman is worthy of his meat.)</hi> And to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Christ the Apostle plainly refers in both these fore-cited Texts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 1 Tim. 5. From all this there flows these Corollaries.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the estimate of Christ in his institutions there is a great difference between the duty of relieving the necessities of our poor Brethren, and this duty of maintaining the Ministers of the Gospel. For tho' the relief of the poor be an act of spiritual justice, unto which, by spiritual obligations, in relation to God, and Christ, we are bound: yet the Maintenance of Ministers is farther due, by the Rules of all humane common Justice that are found among men: So as Rules of humane justice exact it, and Rules of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Justice proportion it according to the desert and merit of the thing. But the poor have not power to claim relief by such a Title, for their Tenure is meerly from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation which the Gospel lays upon us. I find, indeed, a Collection for the Saints at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to be called a debt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 27. but it was a peculiar case, for from this Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> came the word of the Gospel, and the blessings of Spiritual things, to the <hi>Romans</hi> and other <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but this word did not come so from <hi>Corinth (Cor.</hi> 14. 36.) or any other Church. And again, all communication of benefits to the poor is matter of meer service to God (2<hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12.) nay, it is called Acts of grace (2<hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19.) But this is not meerly so, for it is both a gift, and a Sacrifice. And then besides, the Object of this communication to the poor is a certain condition of men, which wisdom must discern, and judge of, and proportion succors accordingly: but the Object of this act of Ministers Maintenance is a settled calling, and labour of men, in rewarding which justice must be shewn. The Rule of measuring out Collections for the poor is as God had blest men (1<hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2.) and that instance is only concerning such a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, but now in all cases, and respects, as the Labourer is worthy of his hire, so a Minister deserves a due subsistence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the Maintenance of a Minister is thus to be regulated by the common rules of Justice in use, and custom, and which are found in like cases; then it is also to be rated according to all these considerations, to which a regard is had in all like Callings. 1. It is to be consider'd that honour is due to Ministers on account of the Dignity of their Office and work, 1 Tim. 5. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that Rule well be counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honour, especially they who labour in Word and Doctrine.</hi> 2: The necessary charges of their Office are to be considered, for by it they are bound to be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and hospitable unto others. 3. The hazard to which by their calling they are
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:154381:164"/> expos'd, is to be had in consideration. As it is a Spiritual warfare, so as Souldiers who stand in the fore-front of the Battle are most open to wounds or death, so Ministers in times of Persecution are most obnoxious to danger. 4. The labour of their Calling is considerable. It is inward especially, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. It is the labour of the mind which spends the best Spirits, and preys on the vitals, and therefore it is the greatest labour of all other. 5. Their Education, and breeding for this Calling is long, and expensive. And Mens pensions in other places, and callings, are valued in the consideration of what is requisite to them. 6. The more, and greater benefits any calling brings, the more it is priz'd, and valued. If Ministers bring in Spiritual blessings to you (as they do) it is but equal that they should partake in those carnal blessings which you enjoy. We may, in justice plead all these considerations, and require as Good and equal justice, as is found to be distributed with respect to any other the like callings among Men. The Rule of Justice is not what the custom of men is to give to Ministers but it is to be taken from the measures of proportion which Men observe in respect to other Callings, which have the fore-mention'd resemblances to this of the Ministry. 3. The party himself who is this sacred Officer of Christ hath a right, and power to set a value on the merits of his office, as well as the people, who are the other party, in all like callings it is so. Therefore neither the deacon, nor the people can oblige the Minister to accept of what proportion of allowance they please to set him: But he himself hath a right, and power to plead for, and claim a just valuable stipend, and accordingly to rate what his Office deserves. It is not left therefore to the wisdom of either the Deacons, or the people, to adjust the value of it. Therefore the Apostle in reference to, this maketh use of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which implies not only <hi>power,</hi> but <hi>authority.</hi> He useth the word three or four times on this occasion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 4, 5, 6. And he expresseth a right, a title, and dominion, which they had over them in this respect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 12. whereby it is plainly asserted that the people have not a power over the Minister to oblige him to take whatever they are pleas'd to give, but that he hath authority to claim what is justly due to his calling. For not only Apostles had this power here spoken of <hi>(v.</hi> 12.) but ordinary Officers, for his words are, <hi>If others be partakers of this power over you,</hi> and by others he means ordinary Ministers, for the false Apostles preach'd <hi>Gratis,</hi> not requiring any consideration. 4. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there were something peculiar found in this calling of the Ministry, which is not to be found in any calling else; unless there were found some Gospel-duty obliging, and requiring Ministers to forego their Right (which, in justice, is to be insisted on by them) and to give themselves up to the free arbitary discretion of the Church and her Deacons; or unless there were some certain proportion set by God under the new Testament, as there was under the Old; A mutual Covenant between Minister and People is the best &amp; most effectual course to adjust this affair. This is evident from the instances, of which the Apostle makes use, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. Unto a Labourer in a Vineyard a set penny is due, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 2. Souldiers also have their fixed pay. The word us'd by the Apostle, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies a Souldiers stipend, as <hi>Beza</hi> observes: And when the Apostle says (1 <hi>Tim</hi> 5. 18. That <hi>the labourer is worthy of his hire,</hi> that which he is worthy of is called his <hi>hire.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> signifies <hi>merces pacta, a reward fixed by mutual Agreement,</hi> and therefore they were not to stand to the Courtesy of those who were to give it them. Nor doth the Apostle use this expression as a proverb only, but as a Rule, which is to be observed. what is said <hi>(Jam.</hi> 5. 4▪) of <hi>the hire of the labourers,</hi> hath respect to <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 15. The instance of Shepherds also hath a regard to what was the usage in <hi>Laban</hi>'s time, when great men had others under them to look after their flocks, and agreed to reward them for their labour by giving them some of the Sheep which they kept, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 31. And to this custom the Apostle alludes, when he says, <hi>Who feedeth a flock,</hi> &amp;c. From all this it necessarily follows that the Minister's stipend is not to be left to arbitary determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but as the Minister and the Church which calls him are joyn'd together by a mutual Covenant, so his stipend is to be settled by a like Covenant according to the dictates of nature's equalest Rule. By this way all complaints will be avoided, all things will be preserv'd in peace between all parties, whether people, or officers, &amp; the one will betyed to the other most fastly by their own Cords. I shall now examine what is pleaded for leaving the Minister's Maintenance unto the free, &amp; voluntary contribution of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 1. Any instances out of the old Testament, to this purpose, do not seem to me convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: what is moral, indeed, in them holds, and accordingly the Apostle brings them, not to be measures of proportioning a Maintenance for Ministers in like manner, but he only resers to the Moral justice of them: That as the Levites lived wholly on the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:154381:164"/> Altar, so it was but just that Ministers should live wholy on the Gospel, <hi>i. e.</hi> that they should not live on their own charges, but on what they have for preaching the Gospel, that they should not live on their own means, but upon that which comes in by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13, 14. But the particle <hi>so</hi> doth not mean that that they should live after the same way and manner, but only that there was justice, and equity for one as well as the other. And so our Lord Jesus Christ ordain'd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 9. 10. So that according to that common Rule of Justice, <hi>The labourer is worthy,</hi> &amp;c. Christ form'd his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with respect to the Ministry of the Gospel. They were indeed extraordinary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, &amp; there what he says to them as such <hi>(Ma.</hi> 10. 8. is not a rule of perpetual obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but he afterward alters this rule with respect to ordinary Ministers in saying that <hi>the workman is worthy of his meat,</hi> Mat. 10. 10. And he adds these further, <hi>Lu.</hi> 10▪ 7, 8. Thus as Christ, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. ordains the institution of a Church, so here, he ordains a rule for the Maintenance of Ministers. But to answer any <hi>Objections</hi> that may be brought from instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the Old Testament, it is to be considered that there is not the same way now for the maintenance of the Ministers of God, as there was then, but there are many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between one and the other. 1. The <hi>Levites</hi> then were a Tribe set apart from their birth by God himself, and accordingly God says that he would be their portion, <hi>Num.</hi> 18. 20. All these dues therefore which the people paid to them were first paid to God, and he gave them to the <hi>Levites:</hi> So that they held them not by any Law of humane Justice, but by Tenure from God, for as these dues were paid to God, so he gave them unto them. But maintenance is due in justice to Ministers, as they are labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, by the same Rule which Christ gives that the labourer is worthy of his hire: And yet too because Ministers are an ordinance of God, and they serve to the worship of God, therefore offerings made to them, are sacrifices to God, and thus they are a gift also, as well as a due: But yet so as the first Object, to whom the due is pay'd, is the Minister, not God, tho' they communicate to him for God's sake, <hi>Gal,</hi> 6. 6. <hi>i. e.</hi> that you may have an ordinance to serve to God's worship, be sure to maintain it, and therefore this giving to a Minister is called sowing to the Spirit, when all other expences are called sowing to the flesh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 8. 2. This chief Maintenance of the <hi>Levites</hi> under the Law was not left to the freedom of the givers, nor did God trust men to assign the proportions of their Maintenance but he did it himself, since he appointed not only free Offerings, but Tithes. There was a portion set for them, and a fifth part of every Man's Estate went one way or other for the Maintenance of the Levites. To leave all therefore only to free offerings now, and to cut off set Stipends, or Tithes, is to put us Ministers into a worse condition than the Levites were. And surely God hath not bound us to these hard Terms: what peculiar bond hath God laid upon us more than upon Men in any other callings? that we, who have both the faith of ordinary Men, and the Spirits, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of Men, should yet depend meerly on free-will-offerings. I am sure as this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers not our Type, so neither doth it take in the Rules of Justice whereon a Minister's maintenance is founded. 3. The Minister's Maintenance is not left to the wisdom of the Deacon. For the distribution of the free-well-offerings of the people among the Priests, was by Rules of Justice, and according to equality of proportion, respect, and measure, being had to their labours, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 14, 15, 16. And now then to make us wholy to depend on the peoples free-will-offerings, and that the Deacon should dispense them according to his wisdom, would be to make our condition worse than that of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites was then, who had treasurers that were faithful to their charge, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 12, 13. 4. It was necessary in those times that some should distribute the Church's Treasure, because the Tithes that were needful for the services of the Temple were brought into a common Bank, and therefore it was necessary that some should be ordained to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it. There was a necessity of doing it, and it was not left to discretion. So here now in the times of the Gospel the same ground holds still, that so far as any thing comes in by common Collection for a particular appointed use, the Deacons ought accordingly to gather it for such an use, and as the Church's hands, to convey and distribute it. This Office, mention'd in that fore-cited text, was matter of needful order, not of Type, or significancy only, as many things were in the Ceremonial Law; which, the reason of them ceasing, the use of them is abolished. For (as <hi>Zepperus</hi> says) <hi>Ratio Legis si cesset ipsa Lex cessat, non secus at{que} animâ expirante, homo moritur, Ratio enim Anima Legis esse dicitur. If the Reason of the Law ceaseth the law it self ceaseth, as the Soul expiring the Man dyes. For Reason is said to be the Soul of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor doth any place, or argument out of the New Testament, evince any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:154381:165"/> to my fore-going assertions. There is mention, indeed, of Sacrifices to God <hi>(Heb.</hi> 13. 16.) But yet it is a Question whether Ministers maintenance be spoken of there, or if it is, it hath that name, because it is a maintenance given to uphold God's worship. And yet still it is given by way of humane Justice to the Minister, who is the person which performs that worship. It is not given first to the Lord, and then to the Minister or Church, but to the Minister for the Lord's sake, and so it is an honouring God with our substance, and a sowing to the Spirit, and to spiritual ends. For tho' it be given to God first, yet that is not inconsistent with its being given to the Minister, but both may stand together, and it is still a debt in humane Justice to the person, the Officer. <hi>Paul</hi> calls it a gift <hi>(Phil.</hi> 4. 16, 17.) But this doth not import that he had no power to claim it, or that it was not due to him, but he calls their offerings, made to him, a <hi>gift</hi> comparatively to the omission of other Churches, who owing the same duty, yet had not done it: Or he calls it a gift with respect to their free doing it. And I think the nature of the thing hath a mixture both of debt, and of a Gift, and, as the way of saving us in the Gospel, is compounded both of Mercy and Justice; so this maintenance of a Minister is an act of Justice, and free love too, yet so as that the free love of the persons both in the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, and distribution of it, must come up to the Rules of Justice, and we our selves may claim it, and set the due rate and value of it, and fix its right proportion: <hi>Have we not power,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6, 7, 8. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 8, 9. Thus to give to the Maintenance of a Minister is a mixt duty, for the Apostle gives the Rules and urgeth the grounds, and reasons both of common Justice, and also of love. He urgeth the Gospel considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it is, <hi>a sacrifice to God,</hi> and <hi>a sowing to the Spirit,</hi> Heb. 13. 16. Phil. 4. 17, 18. And so he calls it likewise <hi>a sowing to the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 6. 6, 7, 8. And yet likewise he asserts a power to claim it as a due, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 8, 9. He urgeth both arguments, that if Gospel-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations did not move them, the plain Reasons of common justice might prevail. That they might consider the Just right and claim that Ministers have to it, and might be influenc'd thereby. <hi>Have I not power,</hi> &amp;c. says he. He urgeth the duty upon them from the Rules of common justice. We are called by Men, and if we are not justly dealt with by them, we have power to leave them. The Apostle's case was otherwise, who was called by God, and so was to trust God for means of liveli-hood, and to work with his hands, and on all accounts whatever to preach the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. 2. The contribution of maintenance to a Minister is left free, and it is fit it should be so, 1. That it may be an exercise of grace in the people, and an offering of Sacrifice to God. And such a freedom agrees with the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Gospel, and is suited to the nature of its services which requires a willing people. 2. This act is left to the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the people that they may have an opportunity of exercising their love to the increase of the grace of love in them, whilst the Minister inlargeth their hearts, they stretch their purses for him. 3. Hereby Ministers avoid the reproach of preaching for Lucre. Hereby the calling of the Ministry becomes more honourable in the eyes of Men, when they see that it is not Mercenary, and that a Minister hath not set fees, as others have 5. The performance of this act is left to the liberality of the people, that they might have an opportunity of sowing more plentifully to the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. Even as men, when they would have more, they use to leave it to the liberty of the giver 6. It is free, that the duty might come under a more transcendent rule than that of meer Justice, tho' still the act is to be regulated by Justice. Thus that Children should maintain their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents when poor, is a duty which nature and justice requires, and the relief and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies should be in proportion to their abilities, yet Justice ordinarily sets not the rate, and proportion, because the duty is also farther an act of <hi>Piety,</hi> and so left to the good nature and disposition of the Person, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. 7. In this duty you are yet to have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct view of Justice in your eye. You must pay it in a just proportion, not only to the necessities of your Officers, but suitably to the dignity of their place, and the greatness of their labour. Tho' you are free in communicating it, yet a law of Common Justice must run along in the distribution. For if it be due by rules of Justice, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in distribution is to be regulated by Justice. For the proportion is Just as well as the thing As the maintenance is due to the Minister, so you ought to give so much or so much, as by Rules of Justice his Office and Work are valuable: So that, what you should give as to the proportion of it is not left to your wisdom, or the discretion of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pirits, but must go by a just Rule. A double maintenance therefore is due to Elders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hat labour in the word, on account of the honour of their place, as the Priests had more than the Levites; and the proportion still must be with respect to the Labour, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. He speakes of proportioning out what they gave to Teacher, as well as Pastor,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:154381:165"/> and to one Teacher as well as to another, by a Rule of justice. Thus, tho' <hi>Paul</hi> less needed maintenance than <hi>Peter,</hi> who was married, and the Apostle could, and did earn his living, yet, he says, he had as much power to exact the same stipend in Justice that <hi>Peter</hi> had, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 4. 5. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning is not that he would marry or purpose to shew that he had power to put the Church to more charges: But his intent is to shew that tho single and unmarried he had power to require what might maintain a wife, for he had the same right to the thing, as <hi>Peter</hi> had. And suppose <hi>Paul</hi> could live without it, yet his right and claim to it was not lessen'd thereby, for <hi>no Souldier goes to war at his own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> His design then was not to tell them of his being in a single condition, but to urge to them the dignity of his place, and to lay before them the merits of it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them of the good which he had done them, and what he had deserv'd at their hands and to draw up an account of his labours, as a thing in justice, which they ought to respect in proportioning a maintenance accordingly, and to convince them, that if they did it for other ordinary Officers, they ought rather to do it for him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11, 12. <hi>If others have this power,</hi> &amp;c. So that he measures it by Justice; And tho' he had no wife, and so had not the same urgent necessities of a Family as others had, yet he had a power to require the Maintenance that was due to his Office and Work, and might exact the same which others did, whatever his condition was, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. So that it is not only the necessities of the Ministers condition that is the Rule by which his mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is to be measur'd, and proportion'd, but the Rule of Justice takes place here also as a Rule of proportion, and it is to be consider'd what his Office, and labour deserves. The measure of the maintenance is not therefore to be varyed by mens necessities, No, the Maintenance of the Minister is not thus to be determin'd by the wisdom of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but they are to be regulated by a rule of Justice in this case, and the calling, the work, &amp; the benefit are to be consider'd by them, as these things are considered in all callings else. Let us take but the instance which the Apostle gives (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7.) what Souldier ever was there, tho' he had a great estate, who would not require his pay, and when he ventures his life for the publick good, expect to live upon the publick charge. And the Apostle tells us it is but just that Ministers should live of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 14. They may if they please generously remit, and forego their right (as <hi>Paul</hi> did) and perhaps in some cases it may be their duty to do it, but this their right is no more subjected to any Man's discretion to determine concerning it, than their Estate in the world (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther personal or real) is. For after that rate a Minister, who hath wordly means, might be oblig'd to give more than other men, and yet besides to labour for nothing. But yet still a Minister may, upon Evangelical ground and reasons, forget his right as <hi>Paul</hi> did. Now, the proper way and means, of raising a due and competent maintenance for a Minister is next to be consider'd, and I shall deliver my thoughts about it in few words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There ought to be set means of a Competent maintainance established by mutual Covenant and Agreement, that the Pastor and the People may be mutually ingag'd And this will take place in a way of Justice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There ought likewise to be an enlargment of his maintenance by free-will-offerings. This is a natural way, and since the Apostle urgeth this duty both from reasons of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Justice (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. to 12.) why should not both of them be observ'd? Both these ways of maintenance were appointed for the Levites, who, as they had Cities for their settled inheritance, and fixed Tithes, so they had free-will-offerings from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And indeed these two methods joyn'd together are advantagious to both parties, for as the first secures a certainty of Maintenance for the Minister, so the other makes him to have a dependance on the love and affections of the people, and as by the one, provision is made that the Minister may have no cause to complain; So by the other opportunity is given to the people of exercising their Graces, and of shewing their love, and thankfulness.</p>

                     <p>Whether the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper ought to be Administred on every Lord's Day.</p>

                        <hi>And they continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine, and Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers.</hi> Compared with Chapter 20. 7. <hi>And upon the first day of the week, when the Disciples came together to break Bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow, and continued his Speech until mid-night.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Will now but open the words so far as to give a hint to that Point which I mean to discourse of out of them: Which is this; <hi>Whether the Lord's Supper be to be Administred every Lord's day:</hi> For which these places use to be alledged.</p>
                  <p>When Christ ascended, he bid his Disciples teach those whom they converted, to do whatsoever he commanded them; <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. Now this Book of the <hi>Acts</hi> records what practices the Apostles taught the Churches, and into what forms they set them. And therefore what we find the Churches to have practised, upon ordinary grounds, that we take for a command of Christ, Therefore is this preface on purpose made to this Book, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2. How that after his Resurrection, <hi>Christ had given Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to his Apostles,</hi> on purpose to credit the Practices or Acts of these Apostles (as the Title is) as conformed to these Commandments. And in this 42. <hi>verse</hi> of <hi>Chapter</hi> 2. you have the solemn standing Worship which the first Church continued in, as a pattern to all that should follow. Which standing worship consists of four Ordinances (which are together reckoned up no where but here (as all Church-Officers no where but <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.) As 1. Apostles Doctrine. 2. Fellowship. 3. Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Bread. And 4. Prayers.) That by Apostles Doctrine is meant Preaching, all do agree; and that by Prayers are meant the publick Prayers (which 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. The Apostles gives order for) not occasional, but standing; is not questioned: but only what is meant by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (translated Fellowship) and breaking of Bread is in Question. For the clearing of this;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain, that all the practices mentioned here, are ordinances; For three of them being so, it had been Heterogenal to mention a fourth thing with them, which was not so. And 2. They are Ordinances of a sort; that is, of which for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual practice, there is like reason: For it is said, <hi>They all continued in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for a more particular Explication of these two words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Fellowship, refers not to Apostles more than <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Breaking of Bread doth, and therefore it is ill translated Apostles Fellowship. I find the Sacrament called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Communion,</hi> 1 Cor: 10. 16. And Distrubution to poor Brethren is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> also, or <hi>Communication;</hi> so some render it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Liberality in Communicating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We find giving to the poor, called <hi>Breaking of bread to the Hungry,</hi> Isaiah 58. And the Sacrament also is so called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16. <hi>The bread we break,</hi> &amp;c. Now what must determine which is which? Surely the manner of the use of the phrase. Now though the Lord's Supper be called <hi>Communion;</hi> yet it is <hi>cum hoc adjectto,</hi> still with this addition, <hi>of the Body of Christ</hi> to distinguish it. But I find <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> when only and alone used, as here you see it is, to be still put for <hi>Distrubution,</hi> and for that alone; thus in three places; as, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>For your liberal distribution unto them,</hi> Rom. 15. 26. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>to make a certain contribution,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>To Communicate forget not.</hi> On the other side I find <hi>breaking of Bread</hi> (when simply and barely so expressed) put for the Sacrament (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.) but never used for giving to the poor, but <hi>cum adjecto,</hi> with an addition; as break thy bread to the hungry. Hence therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (here translated Fellowship) is certainly to be understood of distribution, and so to be translated. And this fitly explains all: for then breaking of Bread is the <hi>Sacrament of the Lord's Supper:</hi> And if phrases must determine it, the Syriack interpreter thus translates it <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> and he best knew the use of the Phrases: And so you have all the four standing Ordinances in the Church enum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated together and no more; whereas else you must want one, as not mentioned.</p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:154381:166"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the Phrase, breaking of Bread, as simply spoken, is used for common eating together?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> It is True; but it is not so here; for that eating is not a Church-Ordinance, and all the rest here, are; and where the Phrase <hi>Breaking of Bread,</hi> simply taken, is used; it is not used for distribution to the Poor: and therefore even that breaking of bread, which is mentioned <hi>(verse</hi> 46.) cannot be so understood of Distributing Bread to the Poor.</p>
                  <p>And if it be further said, that their Love-Feasts are there meant, and so here in this <hi>verse,</hi> and so it may be taken still in distinction from breaking of Bread to the poor; The <hi>Answer</hi> is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That their Love-Feasts were for poor and rich together, and taken up, and used as common signs of Christian love, and therefore so called; and not in order or respect to the poor only or chiefly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their Love-Feasts were no Church-Ordinance, and so not reckoned up here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Church-Ordinances. Christians might privately feast, and providentially, as they met, eat together, as a sign of love; as in the Primitive times they often did, but not in the way of an Ordinance, or a standing Ordinance, as the breaking of bread here certainly is; When they came to make an Ordinance of their Love-Feasts the Apostle rejects them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. <hi>Have you not houses to eat and drink in?</hi> and, <hi>verse</hi> 23.; <hi>I have received no such thing,</hi> and <hi>verse</hi> 34. he infers; <hi>If any Man hunger let him eat at home.</hi> And <hi>verse</hi> 33. He calls the Lord's Supper <hi>eating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; When you come together to eat, tarry one for another.</hi> He speaks of it as the only eating that was to be in a Church as a Church-Ordinance; and so excludes common eating to slack hunger, from being an Ordinance, bidding them in the next <hi>verse</hi> to do it at home. And therefore, says he, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.) <hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the Body of Christ?</hi> which is spoken by way of Eminency and Singularity <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as being <hi>that Bread,</hi> and only <hi>that,</hi> which we break as a Church: as in like manner he had, in the eleventh Chapter, call'd the Lord's Supper <hi>eating to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> namely as they were a Church. And therefore here, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. There is also an Article put, <hi>breaking</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>of that bread,</hi> so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. Now then, come to <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 7. The breaking of Bread there is used in the same sense, namely, of the Sacrament also;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not of <hi>Alms;</hi> that is never called breaking of Bread, but with distinction [to the hungry, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not of common eating; For that not being an Ordinance, no meeting on the Lord's day could be denominated from that; on which day, all Church meetings are for Ordinances only, as principally to hear the word. And to have say'd, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples met to break bread, meaning common bread, is all one as for us to say, the Church meets to Salute and see each other, when principally we meet to hear the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now then, breaking of bread being not here to be understood of <hi>Alms,</hi> nor of ordinary eating; it must needs be meant of the Sacrament: seeing there is no other breaking of Bread, especially as an Ordinance of a Church assembly, spoken of in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>And 3. This is there spoken, to shew what their custom was to do continually, <hi>ex more;</hi> and therefore it is all one, as if he had said, they met every Lord's day. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is spoken of as a ground of <hi>Paul</hi>'s stay seven days, that he might preach to them, as knowing that they would meet on the Lord's day, for this occasion, as they were wont.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It being customary to meet on that day for other Ordinances, as preaching the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for so it was in Primitive times) he would rather have mentioned that for which <hi>Paul</hi> knew they were of necessity to meet than what was used but one Lord's day extraordinarily; if this had not been as customary an Ordinance on that day practised, as any other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is written, and mentioned, though but in an hint, to shew their practice, and so the Apostles Institution; For they taught them to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Christ Commanded. And this we see they did on that Day, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:154381:167"/>
                  <p> The Question which I shall discuss and handle upon occasion of these words, is this; Whether every Lord's Day, the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred? My method shall be;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To prove by reason; that there is somewhere an institution for it to be found.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Further to enquire into these Scriptures, and see whether they do not hold it forth. But, First let us see, what may be done by reason, in the point.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to those assertions which I would by reason establish; I will, for Explication sake, premise something about the differing Rules and Ways that God hath ordered about the determining such Circumstances of his worship, as this is; the consideration whereof will be useful to this and other like points.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed upon by all here, that no such Circumstance is to be determined by the meer will of any Man or Men; and that God hath left no circumstance of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship so to be determined: especially not any so conducible to edification as this must needs be, <hi>How often the Lord's Supper is to be administred:</hi> And therefore the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions and laws of Church-Governours, from will and authority, or of a whole Church in determining such Circumstances▪ we reject; as that for which the word gives no commission; or allowance, namely, not in such a manner to command a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. And in that sense only it is, that we say, no circumstance of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is left unto man; that is, not to Mens wills, or the Authority of others. Hence it is, that for all such Circumstances, we do enquire into other rules, either prescribed in the word; or the light of Nature, and right Reason from the word: and we find two sorts of Rules given us to determine them by.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A direct word of <hi>Institution,</hi> or Example, which we are obliged to follow; as in the Old Testament, to Sacrifice twice a day. This Circumstance was an insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. So for us to pray twice a day, I conceive, an institution; and this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is set by God himself. Now all such Rules do properly belong to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, wherein God took upon him, to give us Rules, by way of Institution, which are by Men unalterable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second sort of Rules to determine Circumstances, of the times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of an Ordinance, are such as depend meerly upon occasions and other circumstances, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the various conditions of Churches, and the customs of Places do require: which therefore for the particularity of them are undetermined by God, and left to the Wisdom of every Church, to determine them as occasions shall alter or vary; yet still, not by their meer will, but by other more general Rules given in the word, or the light of Nature, to order such Circumstances, in all that variety of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, that shall happen, and fall out. As for example; That this Congregation should meet in the day time, is more for the good and benefit of it, than to meet in the Night: which yet for the Primitive Christians in regard of the Circumstance of Persecution, might be more convenient: as haply, that Meeting, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 6, 7, 8. when <hi>Paul</hi> preached so late, as he continued his Speech until mid-night) was, (as some think) in that respect.</p>
                  <p>Now the Scripture hath not determined the night of the Sabbath, for publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, or the day-time, peremptorily: because, according to variety of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, Churches might meet on either, as their wisdom should judge best: yet so, as their wisdom is to be guided by some general Rule of Nature, or of the word in determining this: such as is that Rule, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. Let all be done for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification: that is, Let all be done with such Circumstances, as with which the Ordinances being accompanied, shall serve best to edifie the Church. Now as our case stands, the day-time seems best for our edification by the ordinances; because our Spirits are more fresh in the day than in the night; but to them whose meeting in the day costs them their lives, and the loss of Ordinances, and all; though the night was, in other respects, inconvenient, yet, better then, than not all, or than in the day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to have often met, would have been for destruction, not for edification.</p>
                  <p>So now for us, as to what hour of the day we should meet: About nine a Clock is the best time, considering the time of preparation before, and the weakness of many, and the due times of repast and meales to come after: and that the Church should not meet in the afternoon presently after Meales, is the best also, for edification, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent dullness, or hurt by indigestion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now to these hours (as Circumstances stand with us) we are determined, not by an unvariable institution, but by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:154381:167"/> Rule; <hi>Let all be done for the most edifying;</hi> which falls out with us to be these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual hours, which haply to an other Church would not: and so the determining it to this hour, is not wholy humane; for Men are bound to determine by Rules; yet not wholy or meerly Divine (as particularly pointing them out, as by an institution other circumstances are) but Divine in respect of a general Rule; and also humane, in respect of the particular application; Man's wisdom being left to consider these circumstances, and so to apply these Rules.</p>
                  <p>Now all such Rules about such circumstances do belong to the third Commandment, which meerly takes order for the manner of worship, and the inward and outward Circumstances of it: that all be done (in respect of such Circumstances) for the best advantage, so that <hi>God's Name be not taken in vain,</hi> in the least degree. To give an instance or two in the same kind, one in an occasional Ordinance; and an other in a continued:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the time of Administration of Circumcision, under the Old Law, which was an occasional Ordinance; there were two Rules given by institution:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How oft it was to be administred; but once, and never to be re-iterated.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There was the fixing also of a particular day, whereon it was to be administred, namely, the eigth day. But now,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Query were made, on what hour of the eighth day; that was left to Rules of the third Commandment which prescribe what was most convenient in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of outward circumstances: It was left to such Rules as the third Commandment prescribes, and left to wisdom to apply.</p>
                  <p>So for Preaching the word, which is a continual Ordinance; the Circumstance of time was fixed by institution, that it should be used every Sabbath day, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 26. But how much, or how often on that day; That the particular occasion was to decide: as there were more or fewer men of gifts to speak and prophecy: or as the need of the hearers variously required.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may yet further understand, with what difference these two commands proceed, in the differing rules which they give, about such Circumstances of Time; I will, by way of Further Explication, give you it, in these two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning all such rules which come under the second head, and appertain to the third Command; Take this general <hi>Rule</hi> for certain, about them, to the end you may discern them from institutions, which belong to the second Command. (I speak not now of such circumstances, as the light of Nature dictates, which also belong to this third Command) The <hi>Rule</hi> is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That only such Circumstances of the times of worship, which would necessarily vary through new and differing occasions, or various and several sorts of outward circumstances which Mens conditions are cast into; and so were necessarily (as occasion should fall out) to be left to Churches by wisdom, and consideration of such circumstances to determine; that these, and these only, are left to be determined by those general Rules belonging to the third Command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, 1. The time of all occasional Ordinances is (for ought I know) left unto Men to determine by those general Rules. And there is no Rule given for them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, but this, when an occasion calls for them, that is, their season, and that individual time which is the fittest in all circumstances, for the Ordinance to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred in. Thus, when to have a Baptism, and to fix the time: it is not now, as in the Old Law, fixed to the eighth day, which was in a Type; but is left to the Church to determine. Only, it is not to be deferred longer than Circumstances do in wisdom require. Thus, in Admonition and excommunication, what the fittest sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, doth depend on Circumstances; and the Church is to judge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This also is the Rule, for set Ordinances themselves, so far as they are occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and setting aside their necessary fixed Station. The Word Preached is a set Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, instituted for every Lord's day: yet, if the Question be, How much, How long, or How often on the day, or How often on the week besides! No Rule can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it, but as occasion, and need of the hearers require and call for, and their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy will permit. So that such <hi>times</hi> for any Ordinances do only come under those general Rules, which are capable of new and fresh occasions, that shall call for them, and make them seasonable at one time, more than at another; and are not capable of a set Rule.</p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:154381:168"/>
                  <p> I add unto this, this other Distinction also, For explication.</p>
                  <p>That whereas <hi>Regula generalissima,</hi> the most general Rule and Command belonging to the third Commandment, about the ordering such various Circumstances, is, that famous Apostolical Canon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>Let all things be done to edifying;</hi> and whereas those other Rules whereby God hath by an institution fixed set times for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, in the second or the fourth Command, are said to be for edification also: Yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that edification which flows from God's institution of a Circumstance, and that which follows upon a prudent ordering outward Circumstances, there is an answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able broad difference. The edification which follows upon God's institution of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, is such as is through God's appointment intrinsecally conjunct with, and inseparable from the Ordinance it self, and immediately accompanying it, from which we are to expect a special blessing, together with the blessing of the Ordinance; and so it affords such a kind of edification as the Ordinance it self does, in its measure, being as directly sanctified to edifie, as the Ordinance it self. But that edification which follows upon the right ordering of outward Circumstances, which are left to Men to determine by those general Rules; is but an edification extrinsecal to the Ordinance, and but secondary and subserving to it. These Circumstances being so to be ordered, that the Ordinance may give forth that edification which God hath appointed it unto, with the most advantage in all outward respects. And this is that edification which the Apostle means, when he says, <hi>Let all be done to edifying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence by the way of Corrolary, I would have it considered, whether this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to administer the Supper every Lord's day, be a circumstance of that Nature and rank, that if there be not a warrant from practice and institution by God for it; yet any Church may at all appoint, or determine it for a standing Rule, for edification sake. The reason of my Query herein is this; because this is a Circumstance which for the Administration of other Ordinances God once made an institution of: And therefore for the Church to determine or appoint their Circumstances for this Ordinance without an institution, were to make an image of those institutions of God. That God made an institution of this Circumstance in other Ordinances, is evident in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices every Sabbath day; and in <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> (Acts Chapter 15.) every Sabbath day: and under the Gospel, in the laying up for the necessities of the Saints, the first day of the week, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. But now to make an image or the likeness of God's institution, is that which is forbidden in the second Command; and the prohibition of it is indeed, the full scope, and speaks the utmost extent of that Command; and holds true in all institutions, from the greatest to the least. We may not make Sacraments like to his; nor days like to his (which was <hi>Jeroboams</hi> sin, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 32.) nor a Temple like his, which the <hi>Samaritants</hi> did; nor set our Posts by his <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 43. 8.) nor make the like Oil, that he ordained for <hi>Aaron.</hi> And as it holds in greater, so in lesser institutions of Circumstances as well; for they differ but in degrees; and when God hath once stampt his institution on a thing, about his Worship, Man is not to stamp his; for it were false Coinage, which is against God's prerogative, as it is unlawful to Coin Farthings as well as Shillings: so electively to make Circumstances, in worship every way like to those which God doth, or hath made, as well as to make institutions like to his greater Ordinances. Any thing, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution once set upon it, is for ever after, Royal, and not to be imitated selectively in worship, by Man, or by his institution. We are not, I say, to institute any thing formally like to God's institution, nor for the same holy end, for which God institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any Circumstance; and therefore we must appoint any Ceremonies to teach, or signifie, or to put us in mind of our Duty; because God ordained the Phylacteries, <hi>that they might remember the Commandments to do them,</hi> Numb. 15. 39, 40. So therefore, if God once ordained this Circumstance in other Ordinances, for edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sake, for the Church to appoint the same Circumstance for this Ordinance for Edification sake, is to make the same Image formally, which God once made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> This being a Circumstance upon which an institution is past for edification sake, in other ordinances; it is thereby made uncapable of being subjected to the Rules of the third Command; which gives general Rules to men, to order meer outward Circumstances. Now to subject it to such Rules, were to debase it. It is of an higher rank, and thereby made free (as I may so speak) of the Rules by which Men deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, God only by institution of his own, can now meddle with it. As a Noble Man is of an higher rank, and so not subject to imprisonment for Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> except by a Warrant from the King himself.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you will Object, and say; To have a Sacrament (being a good and holy Ordinance of God in it self) administred every Lord's Day is more for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the oftner the more edifying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If the ground of this Opinion be, that because the oftner an Ordinance is administred, the more may be the edification; I <hi>Answer,</hi> there may be a deceit in that; for there may be <hi>an often,</hi> which may be too much. So in private prayer one may pray too often in respect of other occasions. But the goodness of this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>how often,</hi> depends upon a due season, which either an institution designs, or special Circumstances and occasions: which indeed if they fall out to be every Lord's day; then I yield: but to do it setly, electively, and as a standing Rule; That I Question. So as, the edification that must answer to this so often receiving must either be from an institution, or special Circumstance and occasion leading to it, and calling for it; which varying (as they use to do) cannot infallibly be fixt to every Lord's day as best. However,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That edification which would arise from such outward Circumstances and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, to make most and best for the edification of the Church, to have it every Lord's day, is but a Circumstantial edification, and not such an edification, as flows from, and accompanies this circumstance, when it is an institution: And so it is an edification that comes in upon this ground, that because the Ordinance is good, therefore the oftner administred, the more edification.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If this Circumstance, to have this Ordinance every Lord's Day, had been an Institution of God, for more edification sake, he best knowing how often any Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance would be most edifying that way, would have appointed it himself, if it would be more for edification in such a respect. For he takes as much care for the edification of his Church, in one ordinance, as in another; else he should have been defective in his care in some things, or have took unnecessary care in others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But it may fall out in respect of meer outward Circumstances and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions that some Church should have the Sacrament every Lord's day.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Answer</hi> 1. That then it is not an image of God's institution; for if occasions call for an ordinance every Lord's day (as suppose a Baptism to be administred) yet still because this is not made a set standing rule, whither there be occasion or no (which is the Obligation of a set institution) therefore such a Providence, that an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance should come to be administred, is not an image of God's institution; which is only when in a standing way men so appoint it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Rule depending upon varying Circumstances, can be made and kept but from Lord's to Lord's day; but we cannot make a standing Rule and Canon of it. This assertion or consideration past would have this Circumstance in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Ordinance every Lord's day, to be such, as is not determinable by humane Prudence, or appointment. But I come unto two other Assertions (which I more mainly intend) which do concern this Ordinance, and the Question more nearly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Assertion is, that the nature, and sort, and kind of this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, is such, as there must of necessity be an institution, either expresly, or by necessary consequence, settled by God, and left for the time of its administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The 2. Assertion is, that according to the way, and prescriptions of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that time can be no other than every Lord's day.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first of these two I shall prove in general; that there is, and must be, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution for the time of its administration, and then I shall prove that time to be every Lord's day.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the 1. That for the time of the administration of this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, namely, how often it should be; there must necessarily be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution somewhere in Scripture left, and to be found; or one, at least, that may be drawn from Scripture, by good Consequence (for it is an ordinance of that Nature and sort, as that Reason tells us, there must be an institution left and found in Scripture, about some set time for its administring) This I would evince by such Reason, as if there were as yet no Scriptures that we knew of, to be found for it, and to fix our thought; yet they might set us all a work to find out one. Now this Assertion I prove by these 3 main Propositions laid together.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there are, and ever were, two sorts, and but two sorts of Ordinances appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God in the Church: and they are either continual, or occasional. This proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contains two things in it.</p>
                  <list>
                     <pb n="334" facs="tcp:154381:169"/>
                     <item>1. That there are Ordinances both Occasional, and Continual.</item>
                     <item>2. That there are, and ever were, but these two sorts. </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. I prove that are two such kind of Ordinances. I will here first explain the Terms.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Occasional Ordinances, I mean such, as though they are in themselves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ever in the Church, upon continual occasions; yet in respect of their use, they depend upon a particular occasion in Providence, to call for the practice of them. Some Ordinances were ordained for a single occasion extraordinary; as the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Sacrament of Manna in the Wilderness, and the Cloud, and the Baptizing in the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. but such occasional Ordinances I mean not; but only such as are for their use in the Church, or their Essence in the Church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual; yet still the particular, precise Time when they shall be Administred is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional. Thus in Philosophy, we distinguish of Essence and Existence; and say of several kinds or species of Creatures, that their Essence is always in <hi>Rerum Natura.</hi> So Roses (and many other Fruits and Plants) being a sort or kind of Creatures, that have a station and rank among the number of others, that help to the making up of the World's Perfection; we, in that respect say, The Essence of a Rose always is, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture having ordained such a Creature always to belong unto the World, to make up the perfection of it: But yet so, as we say, that the Existence, or individual putting forth of such Flowers, is but in some one special season of the Year, and not always. Thus in like manner, some Ordinances always belong unto a Church, as parts of its Perfections and Priviledges; and so the Institution of them is for ever and for all times; and yet their Use and Existence is meerly occasional, even as Providence shall put them forth, and call them to stand up in their season. Such was Circumcision of old, which, though it was an Ordinance for ever, and so, continual in the Essence and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; yet the Use thereof was to be but as Children were born, which made the Existence meerly occasional; so, offering Personal Sacrifices, or performing a Vow, were as occasion fell out; as upon occasion of Uncleanness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so Baptism is now, the use which depends upon new▪occasions. So likewise are Excommunication, and Admonition, which are Church Censures, and so likewise Admission of Members; all which are to be used, but as fit matter in Providence comes to be presented.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When I say <hi>Occasional,</hi> the meaning is not, that they are ordained for occasions Negative or Permissive (as I may so call them) that is, when the occasions of the Church will permit, and so a fit spare time falls out for an Ordinance: But when in this Distinction and Opposition to continual Ordinances, we use the word Occasional, the meaning is intended of such as have a positive, peculiar, and special Occasion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and properly calling for them; which Occasion is Affirmative. As when a Child is born in the Church; this is an Affirmative Occasion for Baptism, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Now having explained what Occasional Ordinances are; I come to explain that other sort of Ordinances, which are Continual. Such were the Publick Sacrifices of the Temple, which were called a Continual Sacrifice, <hi>(Jer.</hi> 33. 18.) and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46. 14.) because offered Morning and Evening in a set and standing course, not at all waiting upon occasions. And it is not only said there to be a Perpetual Ordinance, that is, which was to last and endure in the Church (and such, even Occasional Ordinances may be stiled) but it is besides called a Continual Ordinance, because appointed to be every Morning by a set Ordinance of course; so <hi>verse</hi> 14. and 15. it is said to be <hi>every Morning for a continual Burnt-Offering.</hi> So Prayer now is a Continual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>pray continually,</hi> which is not meant of continual occasions; but that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual course of Prayer, or a set course every day (I do not say at set hours) is of God's Institution, as <hi>Paul</hi> says, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3.) that <hi>he served God from his Fore-fathers;</hi> that is, according to the manner of the godly of old, who answerably to the continual Sacrifice in the Temple, offered up where-ever they were, either in Private, or in their Families, the Sacrifice of Prayer, twice a day, and were bound to do so; else the Practice had not been general, nor binding unto <hi>Paul.</hi> But, says he to <hi>Timothy, I have thee in remembrance in my Prayers day and night,</hi> that is, twice a day, every Morning and Evening. Thus also, the very entring into the Holy of Holies once a year, because it was of course and setly, is said to be done continually, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. And so the Passover, though but once a year, yet because of set course, it may be called continual. Thus all Church-Ordinances which are of set course in the Church,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:154381:169"/> and depend not upon occasions, may be called Continual Ordinances, though not every week-day to be administred. Such Publick Prayer is by all confessed to be; and such I take the Word Preached to be also. And so this Distinction of Ordinances Occasional and Continual, if it be not <hi>in Terminis,</hi> in the same <hi>Tearms</hi> set forth in the Scripture, as to both the Parts of it, yet for the one Part it is: For the Term <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual</hi> is expressed in the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ces before cited, and that, in opposition to <hi>Occasional;</hi> for there being two sorts of Sacrifices; fome ordained by Institution to be at set times; others as occasion of Sin and Uncleanness fell out; those which were set were called Continual, in a way of distinction from that other (as also those four Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances here, in this, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42.) and so must have another branch to answer to them, which is this of <hi>Occasional.</hi> However, if the Scripture useth not the very Terms, yet the Distinction ariseth from the thing it self, namely, from the different use and end of Ordinances, which are necessarily such: Only I add this Caution, that solemn set Ordinances, though by Divine Appointment confined to a time, may yet occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be commanded at other times besides; and then upon all such occasions, they become occasional for that time. Thus, though the Sacrifices Publick were a set Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; yet Sacrifice was an Occasional Ordinance also: For when a Man had Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally sinned, he was to bring an Offering to the Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so is the Word Preached, and Prayer now, which though set of course on the Lord's Day, yet as occasion is, they may be used on the week days also. And this is hinted to prevent a mistake, least upon this Doctrine any should think, the obligation to administer this ordinance on the Lord's day to be exclusive, as if upon no other day besides the Church may have this Sacrament, or the word. For this celebration of the Sacrament on the Lord's day is so to be understood, as that it may likewise be administred upon any day besides, though that day be the more proper season of it, and no day to be chosen rather than it. The Gospel's priviledge is in this more large then that of the Law: some Ordinances, then, they could not have, but upon certain set times, and times were so appointed, as all times besides were excluded. The Passover could not be at other times eaten (but only in case of uncleanness, or a journey) but at that set time appointed, the fourteenth day of the first Month. So likewise Circumcision was by institution confined to the eighth day; and they might not do it before, nor defer it till after that precise time. And so many other solemn Ordinances are appropriated to their Solemn Feasts. But it is not so now under the Gospel, when though God hath appointed a special time for publick worship, yet any worship may be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med at any time, and as <hi>in every place we may lift up pure hands and celebrate Church-Assemblies,</hi> so at any time. As the word is to be Preached <hi>in season and out of season,</hi> so the Sacrament may be administred in season and out of season. The Primitive Churches are therefore supposed in that first Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> (whose very calling for a while at first, was only to hold forth all ordinances of the Gospel) to have met (as for the Place) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, at <hi>Home;</hi> That is, in private Houses: for it is spoken in distinction from their meetings, in the Temple: So for the time of their Meetings <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> every day <hi>(Acts</hi> 2. 46.) and so to have celebrated this Sacrament every day even as <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. they are said to preach every day in the Temple.</p>
                  <p>This being premised, and proved; I now come to prove the other part of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in hand, That there are but these two kinds of ordinances in the Church, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional and continual. This I might prove, by an enumeration of all ordinances in the Old Testament; which may all be reduced to these two heads. For as for vows and free-will offerings (which seem most free in Man's liberty) they were occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and such, as when a just occasion fell out, that called for them, they were not to be omitted; nor yet were they made, and offered, but when a just occasion invited them. And, indeed, it were a wonder, if there should be a middle kind of <hi>Vagous</hi> Ordinances, which were indefinitely instituted and at randome; not fixed in the main ground of their institution, unto proper Occasions, or to set times by institution designed under the New Testament. Let any man instance in any other such, and it were strange this Ordinance should be such alone. Indeed, Reason tells us, that there is not, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any such middle Ordinance; for if there be, the main ground of its institution must be, to serve a vacancy from all other occasions of humane business and ordinances; and to be in use when ever such a vacancy should happen, that is, (as I explained in my distinction) that they would be instituted for <hi>Negative occasions,</hi> as not being affixed to any set time of course, as continual ordinances are; nor to serve a special occasion
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:154381:170"/> that calls for it upon one day more than another: but for such a time it must be, when there is an opportune vacancy or empty space of time, that may fall out free from all other occasions, and all other ordinances, both which in this supposition are to be ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved first. Now I instance in this, as a supposed middle between the two other: for I cannot see how the wit of Man can invent any other. I grant, indeed, that such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancys of time may fall out, and also, that those <hi>Ordinances</hi> which God hath already, by a primary intent, instituted for set times, and by Rule affixed to them, he hath, as an over-plus, and an additional edification of his Church, commanded to be used at all such times of vacancy from humane occasions and refreshments. For example; he hath appointed the preaching of the word a set ordinance for every Lord's day (as was said) and so it is a continual ordinance of course; He hath also appointed this word to be dispersed and preached upon all special affirmative occasions that should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it; <hi>As a word in season to the weary,</hi> &amp;c. And these being the main foundations and grounds of its institution; he hath enlarged the use of it unto all such Negative oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, when all other occasions will permit, and there happens a vacant time to hear Sermons Preached and that when no special occasion or time instituted doth require it. But this was but a secondary enlarged ground of this Ordinance, for which alone it should never have been instituted, nor any else. This (as I take it) may be the most probable meaning of that text, <hi>Preach the word in season,</hi> either instituted by God, as the Lord's day, or occasional, as special need requires; and not only so, but <hi>out of season,</hi> in a meer vacancy.</p>
                  <p>Now to prove that there is no such Ordinance instituted meerly for Negative oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, or vacancy from other hindrances, I urge those inconveniences and Reasons against it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such an ordinance would depend for its being and existance, upon too many uncertainties. But now as a Father would not venture any Child to an utter uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain breeding; So, neither can I believe that God hath done so by any of his Ordinances. Now see the several uncertainties in this case.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is not an absolute necessity that such an ordinance should ever be administred at all; for it might be supposed never to come to have any turn or vacancy spare from all other occasions for it to be administred in: for it is not of absolute certainty that there should be such a vacancy, or at least, not often; as this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Sacrament (if this should be said to be such) is commanded to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Besides this, if such times should fall out, yet the Celebration of the Ordinance would depend too much upon Man's arbitr'ment, and that for its only existence and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which must be at such times, not only when a whole Church shall have no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments by reason of other occasions: but when they shall judge so, and call upon one another for it: and how apt our Nature is, to find out impediments, or at least in such Cases to forget the Ordinances, God well knew. And this our obnoxiousness to forget our Duty makes it yet more uncertain; for how apt is such an ordinance to be forgotten, which hath no positive occasion to call for it, nor any fixt instituted time to say to us, now it ought to be administred?</p>
                  <p>It is one reason, and it is a good one, which our Divines give, why it was necessary that the Lord's day, should be fixed by God to a certain day, even to the seventh, and with a <hi>Memento</hi> in the Command; because if it had been left to Men to judge when their vacancy would have permitted it, the Publick worship of God would soon have permitted it, the publick worship of God would soon have fallen to the ground. And by the like reason any particular Ordinance would have been easily forgotten and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contiuned, as many have been, that yet were fixed, as the feast of Tabernacles was <hi>(Nehem.</hi> 8. 17.) from <hi>Joshua</hi>'s time till <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s. You may make an Observation, how great the neglective forgetfulness of Man would be of any such Ordinance, by the difference which was put in the administration of this ordinance, and the observation of the Lord's day (which are the Ordinances we have last instanced in) by the Papists, who alone bore the face of the Church many hundred years. As for the Lord's day, because they thought the institution thereof every week, to be Apostolical (being soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the point, then many of our Divines) therefore they have transmitted the observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of it every week, down unto our times: But as for the time of Celebrating the Lord's Supper, because they thought it to be left indefinite, they therefore kept not to it, but thought once a year enough for the receiving of it by the people; so rarely would men use an Ordinance which they thought was left to their liberty.</p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:154381:170"/>
                  <p> Yea <hi>3dly.</hi> This Ordinance of the Lord's Supper would be made yet more uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; seeing there is an allowance to fill up such vacancies with other Ordinances that are settled to fixed Times by Institution: As to have the Word Preached, or Prayer, when there is a vacancy; and so that vacancy might be as well filled up with them, as with this; and so it might still wait for a place, as that Man did at the Pool, and another Ordinance might step in before it: And if we might suppose any other Ordinances to be left unto Man's sole liberty, yet this least of all; for it being insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to remember us of Christ's Death, surely it self hath either some special Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or fixt Institution, to put us in mind of it.</p>
                  <p>2<hi>d Reas.</hi> As such an Ordinance would be left to too great uncertainties, for its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence; so it would be cast too far below all other Ordinances, for not having a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's settled Portion allotted it to live upon, it must wait upon all other Ordinances, till they were all served, and live upon their leavings of Time; which is not beseeming nor compatible with the honour of an Ordinance. This must necessarily follow; for Ordinances fixed in a set way to the Lord's Day, must be served every Lord's Day; for they are of the Foundation, and challenge it originally. And Occasional Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that fall out, which have a proper especial occasion to call for them, must be also first performed. And certainly God hath not debased any Ordinances so low, as thus to attend all others; especially not so great an Ordinance, as this of the Lord's Supper is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>3dly.</hi> It stands with Reason, that every Ordinance might have its proper root for it to grow up upon, and so come to have its existence; it was meet that it should have a station, and season positive, as the main fundamental ground of its Institution, that so it might exist of it self, and be able to challenge it self a Place that cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it. And thus Continued Ordinances have such a season, by God's primary Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of them; which having an Existence given them at fixt Times, God in a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary intention enlarged the use of them to Negative occasions (as I term them) as he hath that of Publick Prayer, and the Preaching of the Word; which are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Ordinances (in their proper root) for every Lord's Day; which yet God hath further commanded to be ingrafted upon occasions; but still so, as, this is the root they naturally first grow upon: and the Lord's day and every Lord's day is their Seat, and their Station by Institution; and that set time their inheritance, which they may make claim to. Thus Occasional Ordinances likewise have a proper root peculiar to them, like Flowers, that, though they put not forth continually, yet have their season which necessarily gives them existence; and when thir season is, they may challenge it (but whether their season be necessarily and electively only the Lord's day, that I shall afterwards discusse) surely God hath took as good order, and made no worse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, for the existence of his Creatures of the new World (his Ordinances) than for the Creatures of the old, Now every species or kind of Creature in the old world hath a root; a season, either continual and fixed, or special and proper. God made no Vagabond Creatures, then only to have a place and to exist, when and where there should be a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> a void emptiness of other Creatures. And surely God hath acted by the like measure in the new World, wherein the Ordinances are the Creatures; and either some proper time and positive occasion, or else some fixed time all the year long, is their root of being.</p>
                  <p>II. The <hi>second</hi> main Proposition is this; <hi>That for all Ordinances, which are not Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional, but standing and continual, there must necessarily be a set time by Institution appointed for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Proposition is a necessary Corollary of the former, and follows upon those particulars, which I have brought to confirm the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. For every Ordinance that hath an Essence, Constitution, or being in the Church, must also have some existence, and therefore a time. All Creatures of the Old world have two things allotted them;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>Constituted Essence,</hi> by which they are, and differ from other Creatures: As the Essence of a Man is, that he is reasonable; and a Beast, that it hath a Sensitive being.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An <hi>Existence,</hi> by which some individuals of each kind do exist, and stand forth in the world, at such or such times and seasons. And there is no Essence nor kind of Being, but is appointed to have an existence at some time or other, in the world: For else that being might be ordained in vain, and have no being, and so it had as good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:154381:171"/> nothing still. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> says, <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> 3. 1. <hi>That there is a time to every thing, and a time to every purpose under the Sun;</hi> As to every purpose of Man's heart, which is a thing most contingent; So to every kind of thing or being, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Artificial, to all sorts of things under the Sun (for he instanceth in things Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Artificial and Voluntary) and he says, there is a set time; so the word signifies, <hi>Tempus determinatum.</hi> Time is a necessary Circumstance of Being, and therefore was Created when other things were, and is ordained to be, when things are ordained; so as nothing was in God's purpose, that should have a being, but hath a time for it also, which also, as <hi>Solomon</hi> says there, <hi>Gives it a beauty and a comliness.</hi> Now as it was with Creatures of the Old World, so is it with those of the New World, and amongst those, with Ordinances which are parts of it. If God hath given to any of them an Essence and Being to be <hi>Ordinances,</hi> you must suppose them to have a time appointed them, to come forth into existence. As no Creature could come to have an Essence, a Rank among Creatures, but it must have a time to exist, so, nor Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances could ever come to have had an instituted being given them, but in Relation to an existence, and a proper time for them to flourish in. Now such Ordinances which are not occasional, and so have no special occasions allotted in providence to call for their existence, that they may stand forth and call for a place, and be beautiful in that their season, they must necessarily have an instituted time, a set time appointed them. And if providence and occasion do not set out this time, then necessarily Institution must.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The very purport or meaning of this Name of distinction given it, when it is called a <hi>Continual Ordinance</hi> (as in Scripture that phrase is used) doth necessarily inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate thus much; that, that distinction is given it from its having a set time, fixt by Institution for its existence. The word, <hi>Continual,</hi> as it doth respect time in all Men's apprehensions; so in the Scripture acception, it respects a set, fixed, appointed time, that in the Course of time comes about again and again continually, whether it be every day, or every Month, or every year. That was called <hi>Continual</hi> (as was said before) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which is done at all times▪ or every day, but of set course; so (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 7.) <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> is said to sit at <hi>David</hi>'s Table continually, that is, not as a stranger, coming in upon occasion, but at the set times of Meals. And so, <hi>Pray continually</hi> in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is taken, not simply, for praying always, or upon all occasions, or continuing in prayer with fervency only; but to pray settly, Morning and Evening (as I shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3.) even as it is called the <hi>Continual Sacrifice,</hi> because it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout every day by Institution, and if any were seldomer, yet if Ordinances, they had a set time for them. Thus the High Priests going into the Holy of Holies, because it came about every year once, at a set instituted time, is said to be continually, Heb. 10. 1. <hi>Those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which they offered year by year Continually.</hi> As therefore we say, that time is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created with all things, so I may say of such Ordinances, that their time is Instituted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Institution, and by the same Authority.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>3dly.</hi> If any Continual Ordinance had not a Time fixed for it, obliging the Conscience by Institution, that might call upon Men Now to practise it, and challenge an interest in some time allotted it; it were cast below an Occasional Ordinance, and made of an inferiour nature to it, in its Institution: For it would not have so much as a proper occasion to call for it, as those Occasional Ordinances have.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>4thly.</hi> This Proposition is backt with this, that in the Old Testament all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, not occasional, had a fixed Time by Institution. It is true, that some occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional ones also, had a fixt Time when once an occasion required them; as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision the Eight Day, but it was because of some Typicalness annexed to it. But now under the Gospel, all Occasional Ordinances are left to their proper seasons, as Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence calls for them, and so not affixed, as it became the Gospel wherein such Types cease. But yet Continual Ordinances are to be affixed to a set Time by Institution; else Christ were not so compleat in his Institutions, as <hi>Moses,</hi> but should leave things to Man's will, which being as corrupt and negligent now, as before, needed the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such Ordinances to a set Time, as much as then.</p>
                  <p>III. The third Proposition which I lay down is this; <hi>That this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, is a continual standing Ordinance: It is of that Rank, and can be of no other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:154381:171"/>
                  <p> And the Reason thereof (which to me is undeniable) is this; because that it is not an Occasional Ordinance, that is, it is not an Ordinance, that hath, or can have any positive, special, proper, peculiar occasion to call for it, and require it one day or time more than another: And therefore it must be a Continual Ordinance; and so by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, a set, and fixed Ordinance to a Time by Institution; as the second Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition declared. Now the Reason is founded upon this, that there is no Rank of Middle Ordinances, but every Ordinance must (as I shewed) be either the one or the other: And therefore to prove that it is not occasional, taking occasional in that sense before explained, is enough to prove that it is continual.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not occasional in its first fundamental Institution. Indeed some of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Divines would put it into occasional seasons; for they allowing a Private Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at home, when Men are sick, and also allowing in Publick, that the Church should receive not always necessarily together, but that every day when Mass is said, any one or two (though no more who have a mind to Communicate be present) may Receive, if they please. For (say they) some persons may have more special need of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, than others (in respect of Tentations) to be comforted by it: And some have a more special mind to that Ordinance, and are more peculiarly affected unto it, than unto any other; and so may occasionally be called to it. They do hereby evidently shew, that they reckon this Ordinance to be occasional. But we know no such Divinity; for we say,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Ordinance, of all others, is an Act of the whole Church It is the only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Badge of the Church's Communion; and in this respect Church-Members are called <hi>One Bread,</hi> as well as <hi>One Body</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17.) and therefore they are to take it together, when their Meeting hath the full number of all that can come, and this rather than any other Ordinance is in this manner to be celebrated. And therefore (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 33.) in this case, and for this Ordinance, if any come late, others are to stay for them; <hi>Tarry one for another,</hi> which in other Ordinances they are not so strictly tyed unto. And if thus it be the Ordinance of the whole Church; then variety of such occasions, as Personal Tentations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot come to be any such pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, special occasion to the Administring of it to one Man more than another; for it is alike the Act of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Indeed, and in truth, there can never be invented, or supposed, any such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, special occasion, requiring this Ordinance to be administred upon this Lord's day, or that, rather than upon another, which might, more especially call upon the Church for the practice of it. As for other Ordinances, there are such proper occasions, thus prayer for the Sick, Baptizings, and Excommunication: and even the prophesying of private Members is but an Occasional Ordinance, as God stirs up their hearts, and reveals something to them; as the Apostle speaks. There is nothing in the ordinance it self to vary it, or make it more seasonable at one time than at another, but it is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all believers alike, whether grown Christians or young. It is Milk and Strong Meat too; For it is the Common <hi>Christ</hi> of all: neither was it instituted in any such more special manner for Tentations, or victory over Lusts; not peculiarly or special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; so as that you can say, it is good for one thing more than another: or that it hath a special vertue for something, which one Christian needs more than another. But it is an ordained <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, composed of Qualities to work upon all Tempers, and in all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon all constitutions of Souls. If Faith be never so weak, it strengthens it; if strong, a man is as much necessitated to take it, to grow in strength. Even as Church-Fellowship the cause of ordinances, is alike necessary for all, in all seasons, so is this. Yea it is so uniform in its nature and working, that all Churches in the world taken together, have as much need of it as one Church, and one Church as all and no more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Neither can there be any variation in respect of any Circumstance a Church can be in at one time, which it is not in at another. There may fall out impediments; as if the not having an <hi>Officer</hi> to administer it (but so there may be also of such Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances as are affixed to the Lord's day) but there can be no proper occasions or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that may vary it, so as to have it administred one day, and not another. No Man or Church can say, we cannot prepare to receive every Lord's day; nor that any occasions on the week days do unfit us: For they are bound to be in such a Frame as always to be prepared: and if they be not prepared according <hi>to the preparation of the sanctuary;</hi> yet they ought not to omit it, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did not the Passover. Yea,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:154381:172"/> let me add this; it is less subject to variation by occasions, than the Word, or Publick Prayers of the Church, or laying up for the Necessities of others are; for which you have Institutions for every Lord's Day. For the Matter of the Word, the Subject of our Sermons do vary with occasions: And our Sermons are longer or shorter, and they are composed for Comfort one day, and for Reproof another day; for as your needs are, so they vary; yea, sometimes as a particular Member's need is they vary. <hi>A word in season is to be spoken to the weary.</hi> But here in the Lord's Supper there is no such variation. The Word, like the Moon, though it be a standing Ordinance in Heaven, yet appears in several shapes, and so the Word too: But this, as the Sun, is uniform; for the Person of Christ (the <hi>Sun of Righteousness)</hi> Crucified, is wholly and entirely the Matter of it; and as he is the <hi>same to morrow, and to day, and yesterday,</hi> so is this Ordinance. So the Duty of Alms varies: As God hath blest a Man; so let him lay up, as the Church, or other Churches have need. But it is not so with this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: And therefore this is capable of a more uniform Rule, and fixed Obligation, and Institution, than any other.</p>
                  <p>I might in the last place shew, that it is a Continual Ordinance, from this <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. where all Ordinances Continual are reckoned up, which are four in number: And this, in the First Church, as the Measure of solemn set Worship for ever: But I leave that now, intending to argue it out in Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But there is this Objection grounded on that speech of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>As oft as you eat, you shew forth,</hi> &amp;c. The Apostle seems there to speak of it, but as an Indefinite Ordinance, and not as a Continual; in that he says, <hi>Toties quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, so oft as.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. His scope there is not at all to speak of the Time of this Supper; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inform them of the high end and nature and intention of this Ordinance: That when they took it, they might know what they did (as we use to say) and what they were about. You know they slighted it, and took it in vain, and discerned not the Lord's body. He therefore minds them of the Institution, that they might know what they did. <hi>Know what you do</hi> (says he) <hi>for as oft as you receive this, you shew forth the Lord's Death.</hi> It is a manner of Speech, used to shew what is the scope of an action that is customary; when we would insinuate the great danger of some Action frequent, yet out of ignorance slighted. Thus, if we hear one ignorantly and ordinarily swear, as not knowing what it is to take an Oath; we use to say, Do you know what you do in so doing? As often as you swear, you give your Soul to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. So here (says the Apostle) as oft as you receive unworthily, you eat your own damnation. And because they were to receive frequently by Christ's Institution, therefore he minds them the more of it, that they might know what it was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. <hi>As often as you receive</hi> (says he) <hi>you shew forth Christ's Death,</hi> and therefore tells them, that if they receive unworthily, They eat Damnation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This phrase of Speech was to shew the unvarying, constant, uniform End, and intent of this Sacrament; which is constantly at all times to shew forth Christ's Death. So oft as you do it, it is still for this principal end. The word sometimes shews one thing, sometimes another, but this constantly preacheth Christ's Death. <hi>As oft as you receive, you shew forth Christ's Death:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third General Assertion is as the Conclusion of the two former, and inferred from them both; and it is this, That,</p>
                  <p>This being a continual Ordinance (as hath been shewed in the first proposition) and continual Ordinances necessarily requiring a time Instituted, or fixt somewhere (as was shewn in the second) The fixed time therefore for every Ordinance neither is, nor can be other, than the Lord's day, according to the ordinary Course and Tenour of the New Testament, which imports that every Lord's day is the Instituted time for them.</p>
                  <p>I shall demonstrate this by Reason first; and then examine Scriptures afterwards. It is proved by Reason thus; or by these steps.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Under the Gospel you have no other Instituted Time set and fixed, for any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but the Lord's Day. I do not say, you are to have no other times for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, but you have no other times fixed by Institution. Occasional times there
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:154381:172"/> may, and ought to be upon other days, by vertue of the Command, that bids us serve <hi>the season,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(Rom.</hi> 12.) and take the fittest occasion for every Work and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance Occasional. But you have no other Instituted Time appointed fixedly by God, besides the Lord's Day: Which indeed is one of the Differences between the Times of the Law and of the Gospel. Under the Law, God made special Sabbaths by Institution fixed to set Days, for special Ordinances to be administred upon, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Passover, and for the First Fruits: But now, there is no Instituted Time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this. Now then, if this Ordinance, being not occasional (as was said) must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have an Instituted Time appointed it by God, set, and fixed; this Time can be no other than the Lord's Day: For there is no other Time appointed by Institution, under the Gospel, except the Lord's Day.</p>
                  <p>But it may be said, that this gains but only thus much, that the Lord's Day is the Time Instituted for it: And so also it may be said of Occasional Ordinances, that the Lord's Day is an Instituted Time for them too; in as much as it is such for all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in common.</p>
                  <p>Therefore 2. I go a step further, and say, That Continual Ordinances, and among them the Lord's Supper, are not only to have a <hi>Time that is Instituted, for them to be administred upon;</hi> but further, there must be an Institution to appoint a Time for them, even a fixt, determined Time set apart for them by vertue of an Institution, which may determine the Conscience to them, and by vertue of a Command call for them. And so it is not enough to say, That the Lord's Day is the Time Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted indeterminately, indefinitely and at random for this Sacrament of the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as for all other Ordinances it is: But when it is said, that the Lord's Day is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted for it, the sense must necessarily be, that it is the Time fixedly and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately set by Institution, for this Ordinance: And so it differs from the relation that this Instituted Time hath unto Ordinances occasional. It may be said, that the Lord's Day is the only Time, that we find Instituted, wherein they, or any Ordinance may be administred upon: But for other occasional Times in the Week Days, though there be a general Rule that will oblige the Conscience to them, as occasions are; yet they cannot be called Instituted Times. And therefore in that sense it may be truly said, that when Occasional Ordinances are to be administred, the Lord's Day is the only Instituted Time of the New Testament for them. But something more must be said of Continual Ordinances; namely, that there is a Time Instituted that calls for them, and obligeth the Conscience by an Institution to them. And so these two Ordinances differ in their Interest in this Day. That Occasional Ordinances have, by vertue of the Institution of this Day, but a remote, indefinite, undetermined Interest therein; and for their determinate Existence on this or that Lord's Day, there must come over and above, some special occasion, that calls for it, on this or that week, more than on another; only the Lord's Day presents it self still, as a Time blessed, and Instituted for such Ordinances in common and at random. But if this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper be a Continual Ordinance (as it is) and This the only Time we find Instituted; then this Ordinance must have by an Institution some fixed determinate Interest in it; and that by a defining by appointment, what Lord's Days it must be administred upon. And the Reason, for this, is out of the former grounds evident; of which now, I urge only this, that otherwise this Ordinance should have no determinate Existence allotted it; but were in that respect, cast below all Occasional Ordinances. For if its Interest in the Lord's Day be thus unlimited, and but in a common relation; that it is only a Time Instituted for it, no otherwise than it is for all Ordinances in general, and as a common Hall is for all Commers: And withal, that it hath no special set occasion to call for it, and require its Existence; then it is still left in far worse case and hazard for existing, than Occasional Ordinances are: For they (as Providence gives occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) do call for Time, and oblige the Conscience unto a set Time for them: But this would be left like an <hi>Individuum Vagum,</hi> that has nothing to shew for it, why it should challenge a place or room in this Instituted Time, more than Vagrant Persons have in Common Town-houses. Yea, seeing other Ordinances can still challenge some peculiar, determinate Interest, either by Occasion, or Institution; this might ever be extruded, having nothing but an indefinite, common, Vagrant Interest to shew for it self. Therefore certainly, if the Lord's Day be the only Time Instituted under the New Testament; then must be found an Institution to determine and fix on what Lord's Day this is to be administred. And this, not to be left to the wide World for
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:154381:173"/> its subsisting and existence; but such, as by Law, or inheritance, it may call for, as its Portion.</p>
                  <p>Now 3. Therefore add to this then, That if there must be found an institution for it on set Lord's days (they being the only time Instituted) then either the Institution sets apart, every Lord's day, or some special Lord's days (which the word sets out and appoints for it, rather than others) I would see a Warrant for, however, some Churches persume to single out some special days; because their Congregations be too vast (and so not according to Rule, which is, that Churches should consist of no more, than can meet together in one place) to administer it to all, every Lord's day. And others by preferring one Lord's day before another, as <hi>Easter day, Whitsonday,</hi> &amp;c. do appoint it to be only or specially then administred: Yet there is no word for it, nor Reason by consequence from the word.</p>
                  <p>Now, if there be no warrant of institution for special Lord's days; then necessarily, the Institution must fall upon every Lord's day.</p>
                  <p>Yea, 4. Let it be but granted in general, that there is no other Rule to determine this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, but this common <hi>Maxim;</hi> That all Ordinances both Continual and Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional are ordained for the Lord's day; and that the Lord's day is the only Instituted time for all Ordinances in this common general way: let that be all that the word says for it: so as no special Charter or Interest be produced, by Institution; yet this very common Charter will carry it; and this general, indefinite institution will serve its turn. For when each Ordinance shall come to claim its right, and particular allotment, and portion, in these Lord's days; It must necessarily be set forth according to the Nature and kind of each Ordinance. And then, look how Occasional Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will justly put in, and call for an Occasional allotment for their administration, as occasion is offered, and requires; so continual Ordinances will challenge a continual set allowance, every Lord's day. For they must have maintenance and subsistence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Rank and Quality, and end of being ordained. The common Law and Dictate of Reason would, and must thus set out their Portions. Continual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances must be continually on the Lord's day; and what is that, but to be every Lord's day? We say in the Decision of another point of Controversy, and difficulty, between the <hi>Arminiaus</hi> and <hi>Ʋs:</hi> about the existence of things Contingent, and the Voluntary Acts of Man's will; That in respect of God's decree, all things do exist necessarily, and by his determinate Council; yet in respect of second causes, and their coming forth into actual existing or being, we say, that they all exist according to their kind. Which is, that Free agents, as, namely, Man's will should in respect of its own motion work freely: And Contingent or casual things that fall out by chance, should in respect of second causes fall out Contingently, according to their kind: But necessary and natural actions, as, namely, the motion of the Sun, should fall out necessarily and constantly, according to its kind, and yet all act in their several kinds, by the determinate Counsel of God, that rules all their causes according to their kinds. Thus we illustrate also the several existences of Ordinances, for their time and season, by saying, That they are varied according to their several Natures and Kinds. God hath took order in his word, for the existence of them all: but for Occasional Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, he hath not given set Rules of Institution for the time of their existence, to bring them forth in: for that had not been according to their kind, but, indeed, clean contrary to it: For they being in their Institution intended for occasions, accordingly must exist, but as occasions are. Yet by a necessary command, when occasion is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; Therefore as necessarily (when such occasions fall out) as continual Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be administred. But Ordinances of Continual and not Occasional use he hath ordained to exist, according to their kind, Continually, and not Occasionally; and therefore a Rule of Institution must determine their existence. And he having declared that the Lord's day is the only time that is instituted by him for all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances: Suppose he had given no other Rule; yet Occasional Odinances are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist occasionally on that day: that is, as occasion calls for any of them; But continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Ordinances are to exist, and be administred continually on that day; and what is that, but that every <hi>Lord</hi>'s day they should be administred!</p>
                  <p>I will now in the last place, as the <hi>Coronis</hi> and Conclusion of all, and for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of both these Assertions, add only this, which shall concern both, that it stands with the greatest Reason, both that there should be an Instituted Time for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual standing Ordinances: and also that there should be continual Ordinances pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:154381:173"/> appointed for that instituted time; and as much Reason for the one, as for the other. So as there is a proper, peculiar mutual Relation, between such Ordinances, and such an instituted time, they are mutually ordained for each other; these Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for that time, and that time for these Ordinances. It stands with the greatest Reason that may be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God should institute continual standing Ordinances, for his Church to meet together, to celebrate; and so to constitute his publick visible worship; Besides such Ordinances as should be for occasions, that yet uncertainly would fall out. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, who is the great God, the ever-living standing God of the World, who up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds all continually, by a constant hand of power and wisdom; to have a standing set worship, whereby he should be set up, and acknowledged in the World; and not be like the Gods of the Heathen, nor the Saints of the Papists, who were Gods for occasions, and are Saints for special occasions; and as they had Sacrifices, so these have Prayers, upon particular occasions. But the standing God must have standing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. It was not fit for God the great King, to stay and wait upon occasions, for all the publick worship he was to have; which might have fallen out, or perhaps not have fallen out: No, it had been too too little for him.</p>
                  <p>And 2. That he should institute and appoint a set and solemn Time for such Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Ordinances, out of his own will; did become him also; and was as necessary as the former; For otherwise (besides other Reasons proper to that Argument) he had waited upon a greater uncertainty for the celebration of such Ordinances, than that which doth attend upon Ordinances Occasional, even on Mens wills and their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and pretences to put off such worship; For occasions still as they had risen, would have called for such ordinances as were occasional.</p>
                  <p>But if God himself does not set a time, and fix it, there would be nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine and call for ordinances, so as to oblige the Conscience. And so, such ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, in stead of being the standing, continual ordinances of his worship, should have become the most uncertain, and (through Man's Corruption) the seldomest admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred of all other. And indeed, fixedly to appoint, how oft they should be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, and when, is that which makes them to be continual ordinances, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God to be solemn and standing in the world. And the determination of the Circumstance of time, how oft, and on what day, was a matter of more moment, and more intrinsecally conjunct with the worship of God, than the designation of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular place. For though a place be as necessary as a time; yet from a set time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, doth arise a solemnity of worship: and it is as Royal a property and attribute of God's worship, as any other; and serves to set it out, and greaten it. And the iteration of a time in a set course thus or thus, adds to the worship a greatness, both in Multiplication of it, that it is so oft; and also a solemnity and a restraint upon Men; and so bears an impress of God's Authority; But thus it is not in the designation of a set place. Therefore, often in Scripture when there is an institution of a set day for an Ordinance, or mention of such a day; it is called a solemn Assembly, as the Prophet calls <hi>the new Moon's Feasts and Sabbaths that were set, The Solemnities of the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. 17. and 46. 11. And <hi>(Levit.</hi> 23. 36.) the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles is Translated a Solemn Assembly; which accordingly is by Christ called the great day of the Feast, <hi>John</hi> 7. 37. Solemn they were, by being set, and thereby greatned. And every such day had its set Ordinances by institution appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fill up the worship of the day, and (as the Phrase is, <hi>verse</hi> 37. of <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.) God speaking unto <hi>Moses</hi> concerning the Ordinances to be upon such Feasts, says, <hi>that they must perform every thing upon his day.</hi> For every such set time had its set Offerings and Ordinances; and the days were appointed for them, and they for the days. And therefore a standing day must have standing Ordinances, that have a proper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrence to the day, and the day to them; they being made for the day, and the day for them. And this difference for God's instituting a set time for worship, under the Gospel, rather than a set place; They who are against the Institution of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, have not considered; when they argue, that there is like Reason of Place and Time, between which, is this Relation to worship, there is abroad and manifest dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                  <p>Now then, if under the Gospel it was meet there should be <hi>Continual Ordinances</hi> for a standing Worship; that God might still be sure of being worshipt (whatever occasions were) and that there should be a set Instituted Time in these Ordinances:
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:154381:174"/> Then marry these two together, as being made one for another; these holy things, for this holy Day; standing continual Ordinances, for this set, and standing Day, according to the proportion of that Rule, out of <hi>Leviticus, Every thing upon his Day; Opus Diei in suo Die;</hi> the Day and the Ordinance thereof being mutually made for each other. And thus a solemn and standing Worship shall be kept up in the World, under the Gospel, as well as under the Law, which also was prophesied of <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 46. 13, 14, 15.) That there should be a continual Worship now, as there had been a continual Sacrifice then. For there <hi>Ezekiel</hi> prophesies of the Worship of the Gospel, and that, under the Type and Notion of the continual Sacrifices and Sabbaths.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 1. See the gracious Provision that God hath made in the World for his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and also for to feed his Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He being a great King, for his own glory reserves a standing Revenue of Glory to come in by Worship of Men, to himself, as it became him, besides that which comes in by occasions. You know, Princes have Crown-Lands, which bring in a standing Rent, that cannot be sold, or alienated (in a Legal way) and they have Customs and Tributes, which come in other ways; but the other are their Royalty. So God hath standing Ordinances, as Crown-Lands, to give him a set Revenue of Old Rents, which must never be left unimproved; as well as he has occasional Customs from other Ordinances.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See here the gracious Provision made for the Church; the Family and Houshold of God. Here is a constant Provision, of no less than four Ordinances, the Word, Prayer, Communication, and the Lord's Supper. We are not like to starve then. God hath kept to his own Rule, to <hi>provide for his Family.</hi> As good House keepers have some constant provision of store, as Corn, Beef, and the like; besides all occasional Dainties, that, like Fowl and Fish, come in to their Tables; so God hath laid up all spiritual provisions for us: And to be sure you have Christ himself for one standing Dish continually served up to you, as some Rarity useth to be served up, again, and again, and goes round at last. A Dish that fills all, and serves all Tasts (as they say <hi>Manna</hi> did) which is Milk to Babes, and to grown Men strong Meat; <hi>all in all, and unto all.</hi> Many things in a Sermon thou understandest not, and haply, not many Sermons; or if thou doest, yet findest not thy Portion in them; but here, to be sure, thou maist. Of Sermons, some are for comfort some to inform, and some to excite; but here in the Sacrament, is all thou canst expect. Christ is here Light, and Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Comfort, and all to thee; he is here, an Eye to the Blind, a Foot to the Lame; yea, every thing, to every one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 3. Hath God himself instituted both a Time, and also standing Ordinances for that Time, to keep up a constant Worship? what arrogancy is it then in such Church-Governours (whether Popish, or Reformed) as assume this power to themselves? say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Christ hath instituted no set Day for his Worship, but has left it unto them; it becoming the Liberty of the Gospel, not to be subject to Days and Times, as under the Old Law: And that God hath not defined out what set Times should be for the Lord's Supper; and so it falls under their Jurisdiction to appoint it; and they do all this, to enlarge their power. I will never believe that God would trust Officers with settling such Circumstances of Worship, as he trusted not his own High Priest with, under the Law, but settled them himself: No, God would have never have left mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of so great importance, at uncertainties: He would never have left even the Revenues of his Crown-Lands to those Landlords, of whom many would have the <hi>Vineyard to be theirs.</hi> And the fruit of their assuming this power, you may see in the Lord's Supper; which is absolutely by them commanded to be received at some certain times of the Year, no oftner necessary to be received; which is their poor Allowance for that Ordinance. And if God had left the Time of all Worship to their appointment, and not more clearly fixt it, it would have come to the same pass in process of Time; and a Sabbath once a Month would have been well, which haply might have been but once a Year. And yet all this was for the Churches Liberty; to free them from God's Yoke, and to bring the Consciences of Men into a worse Bondage of their own. As if God had made Christians free now, from the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Sabbath to that of the Jews of old, and which himself then enjoyned;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:154381:174"/> to leave room to Men, and their Power, to determine the very same. Thus they exclude God, that themselves may Rule. But blessed be thy Name, O God! that tho' other Lords besides thee have Ruled over Us, and would appoint us when to have Sabbaths, and Sacraments; yet thou hast wrought all our works for us: Thy self hast appointed our Works, and Times of serving Thee: Thy Service is perfect Freedom, but theirs is Bondage, which thou in mercy hast freed us from.</p>
                  <p>That you may clearly see the goodness of God in it, I will add this, that I find the Papists themselves, and the best of their School, acknowledge, That the Lord's Supper being a Sacrament given, often to be administred; there must necessarily be a defining by some Divine Authority, how many times at least, we are to receive it, else, says <hi>Vasques,</hi> the Affirmative Precept binding no Man so to any precise Time to receive this Sacrament; but that he might omit it, a Man might forbear to receive it, all his Life-time, (as well as any time) without sin. The like saith <hi>Suarez.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they say, that Christ indeed left it indefinite; because he left power in the Church, to fix a set Time <hi>how often;</hi> which the Pope by Divine Authority (say they) hath done; which if he had not, this Precept, if indefinitely given, would not have necessarily obliged a Man all his Life-time. And therefore they say, it is a sin not to Receive once a Year, because the Pope (in whom is Divine Authority) hath so fixt it; but not oftner to Receive is no sin. But now we, if we were left thus indefinitely (whose Consciences cannot acknowledge any such Power in the Church) were left in a miserable uncertainty, how oft, at least, we must Receive or we sin. We have no help in this case, but the Word it self to decide it. And this is necessary. For, as we say of a Church, that the set Number, how many it should consist of, cannot be determined; yet there must <hi>ad minimum,</hi> be two or three gathered together in God's Name (as it is set down, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.) or else it is no Church; one Saint alone not sufficing to make up a Church: So I say of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though <hi>How often</hi> at most it may be administred, cannot be determined (for it may be administred every day, as it was in the Primitive Times) yet how oft at least it must be administred, was to be determined so, to set bounds unto Man's neglect, and fix the Institution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 4. If the Lord's Day be thus primarily appointed for these Ordinances, and they for it; you see then the Errour in appointing any other day electively for the Lord's Supper; as <hi>Christmas-Day,</hi> &amp;c. Besides their missing of that Blessing which attends the Instituted Day of this Ordinance, they furthermore set up Days like God's, and prefer them to his; and yet thereby do afford this evident Beam of Light to us, that such an Ordinance honours a Day; for to that end was the Sacrament appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them to be on those Days celebrated; and so does this Ordinance, and the like, honour the Sabbath, which is sanctified by them.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Some Cases concerning the Time of the Administration of Ordinances Resolv'd.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>UPON what hath been hitherto treated of concerning the Administration of the Lord's Supper every Lord's day and the grounds thereof, there is a just occasion, or perhaps a necessity of Propounding and of Answering some Queries about other Ordinances. Some Cases of difficulty are to be discussed, and which are indeed the greatest difficulties and knots in this Question.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is to be considered What interest this Ordinance of the Lords Supper hath in the Lord's day comparatively to other Ordinances? and whether by institution this Ordinance is to be administred, whatever be done about others?</p>
                  <p>And 2. If all have an interest also, then if the Case should be that the time and state of the Congregation cannot permit that all should be administred, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered which of them should rather be cut short or give way?</p>
                  <p>To Resolve these Cases; First in General, to prevent mistakes, I premise these two propositions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is no such institution of any Ordinance, that all other Ordinances should give way to it, or that by institution this or that of necessity you must have,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:154381:175"/> whatever become of others. 'Tis true, indeed, there is a general Ordinance that Sanctifies all Ordinances, as every Creature is sanctified by Prayer; as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> speaks. We are to pray afore the Administration of every Ordinance as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is; But such prayers came in but as appendixes and handmaids waiting and attending upon those Ordinances. They come to have a room not upon their own Title or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest primarily and <hi>ex se,</hi> of themselves by a special proper institution that gives them this subsistence; but as adjuncts and attendants of those Ordinances, that when any of them is to be administred, then prayer necessarily must be before to Sanctifie it. But this is but a dependent secundary Title and Interest that such prayers come to have in the vertue of those other Ordinances; as where the Lady goes, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman-Usher goes also, but for her sake only. Thus although Prayers go before, yet in the right of that Ordinance that follows.</p>
                  <p>But otherwise take these kind of publique services (which you have here, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. and which are commanded, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1.) as they make up an Ordinance instituted as distinct from all the rest and that stands alone and is a Substantive Ordinance. And so know that this Ordinance so taken is not of that absolute singular transcendent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, that this must be, whatever be done with the rest. They are all second Commandment Institutions, and must have alike their turn. They are Children all of one Father and of one Rank; The Eldest, which is prayer, is not enobled above the rest, that it must have a Subsistence, whatever becomes of the Younger Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Interest, which by Institution any Ordinance hath is not such but that in Cases that may face out, any of them may give way to another; or all of them may give way to one. For besides the necessity of the Institution, there may be a Superadded ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity by Circumstances, that either now a particular Ordinance must be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, or it cannot at all, or not to that full purpose be administred as is meet, and so God's name would be taken in vain. So it may fall out in the Admission of, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of a Member. And so it may seem to have fallen out in that case, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. That <hi>Paul</hi> preacht out the time of the Lord's day and administred the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament at night when the Sabbath was ended:</p>
                  <p>For as he was an extraordinary Officer, so therefore his preaching was more than an ordinary Ordinance. It had a Superadded power of infallibility went with it. And though it was still but an Ordinance of the 2d. command; yet it was an Ordinance extraordinary and which they could enjoy but once; and at that once receive a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build their Faith upon, and raise other Sermons upon that foundation all their lives. Yea, and it is to be considered that they could seldom enjoy him in that way of God's Institution, for their Office was to go up and down. And it is to be considered too that he was in the heat of Preaching, and though he broke off in a case of absolute necessity to restore a man to life, yet he would not break off for another ordinary Ordinance, for that work as in his hand it was performed was greater.</p>
                  <p>And so that place (wherein he says, <hi>I was not sent to baptize; but to preach)</hi> is to be understood, for his preaching was an Apostles, his baptizing was but as an act of an other man, the one was as an extraordinary Ordinance in his hand, the other was but as ordinary; yet it doth not follow from hence that ordinary preaching is to be preferr'd to baptizing.</p>
                  <p>Now there may (I suppose) fall out Cases, wherein there may a circumstanial ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity fall out superadded besides that of simple Institution; and then an Ordinance that hath place meerly by Institution may give way; as Ordinances Instituted do to works of necessity, as well as mercy. And there may be a necessity of mercy come to be annexed to the Administration of an Ordinance by some special Circumstances; and then an Ordinance that hath but the meer necessity of an Institution, must needs give way, as it doth to other works of necessity, but still not by vertue of any tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent singular institution.</p>
                  <p>The Rule of no Institution is such, but an impediment may come in; and no Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance is so instituted but it may give way to another.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer to the Case, the question may either be made of this Ordinance in Comparison with the Continual Ordinanes, Prayer, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or, 2. The Question may be of Occasional Ordinances as Baptism Admissions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:154381:175"/> 1. If the Question be limited to Continual Ordinances, which of them hath more Interest?</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Answer,</hi> They have, by Institution, Interest alike: But yet so as one may have in Order the priority afore the other; As, <hi>Let first of all Prayers,</hi> these publique pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 1. He speaks of Ordinary Church-meetings, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears throughout that Chapter; So that prayer hath the first place, by institution. And then the preaching of the word seems to challenge the next place yand the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Lord's Supper the last; But whether after all other, or no, I yet know not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some Ordinances may for the meet Administration of them require more time, or else they are lamely Adminstred. So preaching may be oftner and require more time. I observe the phrase used, Acts 20. 11. <hi>When Paul had talked, a long while,</hi> as we translate it, but in the Greek it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. When he had said what was fit throughly to instruct them in what their necessities required; when he had said <hi>enough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is certain that there is time enough for all standing ordinances and continual or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances upon this day: and so as none of them will take up time so as to cause one to give way to another; and their Interest by Institution is alike.</p>
                  <p>But 2. The Question will most fall upon occasional ordinances, &amp; if so stated; I deliver my Judgment with submission herein.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Interest which continual ordinances have in the Lord's day is (as I take it) more direct, immediate, proper and constant; so as it is a more native prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry interest compared with that which occasional have.</p>
                  <p>I call it more direct, and immediate, for there is no third thing that comes between them to bring these two, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord's day and these Ordinances together, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ground formerly delivered, both being set and standing, they were made on purpose one for another, these for the day, and the day for them; that so to be sure God might have a solemn standing worship, and not occasional only. So as the time, the Lord's day it self by institution calls for their administration and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting. But as for occasional Ordinances the day doth not thus immediately call for them, but only as an occasion intervenes, thus Baptism is required when a Child is to be Baptized.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the allyance between the Lord's day &amp; continual Ordinances is, as that of a man's own kindred, immediate and direct, and of themselves, but that of it and the other Ordinances but as of affinity by marriage, through some middle thing coming between, that causeth it. And as it is thus more near, so more constant; and the constancy of any Relattion and tye mutual makes a greater nearness, than that converse that is by fits and times.</p>
                  <p>Men that stand in such a relation one to another, that they must constantly meet together out of Office or a set Constitution, are &amp; ought to be nearer one to the other in interest &amp; respect, than those that use to meet but occasionally and by fits when such or such a business falls out. Now the <hi>Lord</hi>'s day and other occasional Ordinances meet but oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally, but those that are contiual are standingly yoked together with it, and meet by mere Institution; And so their Interest comes to be primary and native, and in the first place, for that God might have a standing worship at set times, both this day and ordinances were ordained. But the day being thus ordained for this standing worship, and so founded, occasional ordinances are administred also, and the Church then meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Institution, they are fitly administred then. It is as in founding Colledges where the founders build Chambers and places of publique resort for Scholars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, but between the Scholars the Statutes do put this difference, that someare Scholars of the house as we call them, and of the foundation, which, that the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge might be sure to be upheld as a society, have a set pension and places of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance, that the Colledge may not be dissolved: and others are Pentioners, for whom the Statutes provide that such should be admitted also; but yet the primary, native, original foundation &amp; interest, is that of Scholars of the house who are therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Chambers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> before others; and the other is but the Interest of Strangers that are added to them, and have room amongst them by the founder's will. And hence (as I take it) is the denomination of your Meeting and Assemblies more frequently given to these continual Ordinances, even by reason of their primary original Native &amp; Constant interest, as the ground of it. Thus here it is said, Acts 20. <hi>When they meet to break bread,</hi> And (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20.) Their coming together in all those places is
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:154381:176"/> mentioned as if only it were for the Sacrament. Now the Reason is, because they are primarily and constantly to meet together for these Ordinances, and the Lord's day being first ordained for these, other Ordinances came to have a fit season also: by reason it is a sanctified time and the Church is then to meet. This seems to be the way made for the Administration of an occasional Ordinance, as (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4.) for Excommunication, when ye are gathered together, then to deliver such an one to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: but for the Sacrament they meet, <hi>to eat,</hi> and the meeting is denominated from it. Now as an house is denominated <hi>theirs</hi> rather, who are the standing dwellers than occasional Incomers, that for an occasion have a room in it, so 'tis here. As the Gospel and Ordinances of it are called the Heavens in Scriptures, as <hi>(Psalm</hi> 19. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. compared) So these standing Ordinances are apointed as the Sun and Moon that divide and constantly Rule this day; and other Occasional Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are as the Stars that have their influences in their seasons, <hi>Job</hi> 38. 32.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second thing whereby I express my self in the Comparison of these two Ordinances Interest in this day is, That answerable to this more direct and primary institution of these, each for other, it comes to pass that a more special blessing doth mutually arise from the administration of continual Ordinances. God, when he sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and instituted this day, blest it also; which blessing is actually derived to us through those Ordinances administred upon it, as those whereby the day is sanctified; and he in like manner sanctifying these continual Ordinances for this day blest them by ordaining a special blessing from their administration by this day. The day bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Ordinances more and the Ordinances convey the blessings put upon the day, which, I say, ariseth from this primary fundamental institution. So that though you may have a Sacrament of the Lord's Supper on the week day, and so likewise the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word (as was said) yet there is a further blessing on them may be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this day than any other.</p>
                  <p>So as, put the case you could meet conveniently enough for your occasions for a Sacrament on the week day, and therefore would defer and put off the Lord's Supper from the Lord's day; yet you should choose rather to have it on the Lord's day, for there is a special blessing on it that day, which through the mutual ordination of one for the other is bestowed upon it; so as that very reason should sway it rather to the Lord's day.</p>
                  <p>But now for an occasional ordinance I do Question, and do but propound it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be such a special blessing that ariseth upon it, from this day rather than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other day: So as a Congregation should rather put themselves to some inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to have all such Ordinances administred on the Lord's day than on the week day, meerly for the Blessing sake which the day brings upon them. And my reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, they being Occasional Ordinances, and occasions calling for them, receive their special blessing (if any there be) from time or season or from their occasions, and so as their occasions give them existence, an <hi>Esse,</hi> so also the fittest season that is suited to such occasions in respect of occasional circumstances, gives them their <hi>bene esse</hi> or <hi>melius esse,</hi> their better being. So for baptizing a Child; as when a Child is born to any of you an occasion calls for the being of this Ordinance: So those Circumstances of time whether on the week day, or the Lord's day, as shall suit best with the good, or avoiding the hurt of the Child; the Conveniency of the parents, who may be to go a Journey, and the occasions of the Congregation, do give the preheminence to the administration of this Ordinance. And the same may be said as to admission of Members, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are not simply for the Lord's day's blessing, to affect to have these Ordinances on the Lord's day, notwithstanding other inconveniences. But we ought to insist on it to have the Lord's supper on the Lord's day, for it is the work of the day, and the day is appointed for it.</p>
                  <p>But Though baptism is an ordinance to be administred but once and so (if a greater blessing could be supposed to accompany it on the Lord's day) it were much rather to be desired upon it, than any other day, yet we see the Apostles in the <hi>Acts,</hi> did baptize presently upon any day, as <hi>Philip</hi> baptized the Eunuch in his Journey, and <hi>Paul</hi> baptized the Jaylor's Family, &amp;c. For the deferring it was not worth any speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al blessing conveyed by the Lord's day upon it; when all things else fell out to call for the administration of it. And therefore we are not bound to administer it on the Lord's day meerly for the blessing sake.</p>
                  <p>Now then to sum up the Solution of the case.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="349" facs="tcp:154381:176"/> 1. If all ordinances, both continual and occasional, can be administred on the Lord's day, as conveniently every way as on the week day they should. The Reason is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is sanctified time instituted for Ordinances; neither is any other time insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If all Ordinances cannot be administred on that day, then, I suppose no one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Ordinance is in the frequency of it, so for to be preferred, as that it should be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on this day, and another should give way: There is here to be observed the same Rule which the Apostle gives for prophesying of all. If many be in a Church, and all cannot prophecy at once, the Rule is, that two or three should do it at one time, and two or three at another and that by course, So, say I, let Ordinances take their course in their omissions, and no one be preferred to therest, but let it go by a <hi>series</hi> one by one, as the Apostle there says that all may prophecy.</p>
                  <p>These are Rules given by command for ordering Ordinances, and suit with right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (so <hi>v:</hi> 37.) when ordinances have a like interest.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or thirdly, That all may be administred every Lord's day, there must be the less time given to every one. For that also is a rule to order prophecying of Brethrn by, which have a like right and interest (so <hi>v.</hi> 30.) let the firsthold his place, that is, so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract himself that another may speak, to whom God may have given a Revelation as well as to him, and therefore he must not take up all the time. The like, I say, is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served with respect to ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Or 4. The assemblies may begin sooner; and though some cannot come so soon yet when the most may, let them begin and the rest come after. For though for a special reason ye are to stay each for other for the Sacrament (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) because it is a badg of the Communion of the whole: yet I know not whether we should all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways thus stay for all other Ordinances for it is better that some few should want part and the beginning of the worship, that the whole may enjoy all.</p>
                  <p>Now these things I speak in case the Church cannot meet on other (as it seemed these in <hi>Troas, Acts</hi> 20. could not; for <hi>Paul</hi> stayed seven days for an opportunity to preach) which may also be the case of some Churches that are poor and numerous.</p>
                  <p>But in case the Church meet upon other days, and occasional Ordinances so encrease, as you cannot have all upon the Lord's day: or the inconvenience otherwise is such you cannot. Then,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the reasons above given you should defer occasional Ordinances (as you use to do) to other days, and keep up the solemn standing worship by these Continual Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
                  <p>As I apprehend it, the Lord's day is electively to be taken, for breaking bread but; not so for admission excommunication, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in that case you are to deferr Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Ordinances rather for this Reason also. For being to be done but once for all, it is all one on what day,; it is no loss to defer any of them to the week day, or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Lord's day: But if you omit a Lord's Supper upon this day, it is an irreparable loss: There is one Lord's Supper less in the Course of Sabbaths in your lives, and the loss cannot be made up: 'tis as the loss of a good thought in it's season: But in the other case, <hi>omittitur non ammittitur,</hi> there is a delay but not a loss.</p>
                  <p>And 2. There may be such Circumstances in Occasional Ordinances, as will make their administration much better on a week day than on the Lord's day. And admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion may require haste, through some journey to be taken by the party, or the like. So, a man's sin may be so ripe and high, as I would not have his excommunication deferred an hour longer that so the Church may clear it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> But here comes in the Objection, that there is no time under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for which out of duty Christians are bound to meet, but the Lord's day. There is no other time instituted, and therefore it is to be supposed that the general rule that binds all Churches is that all Ordinances should be on the Lord's day only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I Answer, That, indeed▪ there is no other time singled out by institution to oblige them to Assemblings together but the Lord's day. But yet there is a command to meet upon other days when pressing Circumstances urge to it, and their occasions will permit. The same command that lyes on <hi>Timothy</hi> to preach the word out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, lyes upon Churches to hear out of the proper season assigned by institution. Other Circumstances may press to a necessity of a duty as well as an institution may; and so may oblige to meet on the week days, as well as Institution obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:154381:177"/> us to meet on the Lord's days. And if still the condition of any Church be such (which yet ordinarily we see by weekly Lectures general in City and Country it is not) that they cannot meet on week days; but Occasional Ordinances multiply so as that they, and all continual ones cannot be administred on the Lord's day; then, say I, let some of the Continual give way at such a time, for if the case be that an Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Ordinance may not be administred at all, if not on that Lord's day or that it will otherwise be deferred too long, then, rather omit the practice of a Continual Ordinance rather than <hi>that occasional one</hi> should be so hazarded. And the Reason is because <hi>that Occasional Ordinance</hi> is a thing to be done but once: And rather than not have a Child baptized at all and dye ere baptized; it were better to loose a Lord's Supper which you may have every Lord's day. The Lord's Supper you have always with you, but not the other.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Whether a Church of Christ may lawfully make an Agreement among themselves to to divide themselves into several parts, and to have the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper Administred to one of these Parts one Lord's day, and so successively to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of the Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Need not prove the first principle of a Congregational Church, and its being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God as the seat of his publick worship and ordinances. I have already proved it, and may take it for granted by these, who profess Congregational principles with difference from others.</p>
                  <p>The Papists professing a visible Church Catholick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do allow the dispensation of this ordinance of the Lord's Supper <hi>Vage</hi> and unlimitedly; Hence they have private Masses, and they think a Priest, and one more, to be enough for the performance of them and also for the giving and receiving the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Our Episcopal Divines, professing a National Church, allow a private communion to a party that is sick in case of that necessity.</p>
                  <p>Our Presbyterian Brethren that profess a National principle and that every ordained Minister is a Minister to the whole Church, do assert, that if several Christians meet and one such Minister be with them, he may (especially in difficult Times) administer the ordinance to them, though he hath no special Relation of being a Minister to them as a Congregational Church, and tho' those Christians have no particular Relation of members one to another.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Scotland,</hi> also, a good and holy Minister, in repute, cometh to a place, and when thousands of people gather about him from far and near to hear him preach, ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such a Minister useth to administer to them the Sacrament also.</p>
                  <p>That which is my design is to find out <hi>what of a Church</hi> is the true and proper seat of this ordinance of the Lord's Supper.</p>
                  <p>The Seat impowered for this, or any ordinance, is a matter of great moment, and it is not a Circumstance such as a local place is, and as <hi>houses to eat and drink in</hi> are. This is but a meer Circumstance of place, but (as the Apostle speaks) of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <hi>the Church of God</hi> is unalterably the seat, as the opposition there shews, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 22. Such Circumstances the Church may and doth appoint but the proper seat of an Ordinance instituted is another manner of thing.</p>
                  <p>The Passover (which this ordinance doth succeed) had an whole family appointed for the seat of it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 46. <hi>In one house shall it be eaten, thou shalt not carry forth ought of the Flesh abroad out of the house,</hi> &amp;c. Afterwards it must not be celebrated in any City but in a Family in <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> Deut. 16. 5. 6. <hi>Thou mayst not Sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee. But at the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt Sacrifice the Passover at even at the going down of the Sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which (as holy <hi>Ainsworth</hi> says in his discourse of the communion of Saints) a new Testament Church answers as the seat of ordinances.</p>
                  <p>Now that which I shall first do, is, to find out whether this ordinance of the Lord's
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:154381:177"/> Supper hath not a proper seat for it, with difference from other ordinances of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that may be administred every where. I mean not as to the Circumstance of place, for of that the Apostle hath determined, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 8. <hi>I will men pray every where,</hi> as to place, and so the Sacrament may be administred any where for place. But as the ordinances of discipline have, beside the circumstance of place for meeting, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per seat of a Church <hi>(Do not you judge them within,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. that is within yourselves and that are of you?) So the enquiry is whether this Ordinance also hath not a <hi>sedes propria, A seat proper to it</hi> with difference from other Ordinances, and what that may be?</p>
                  <p>This enquiry I shall manage by considering.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our own commonly received principles hitherto, &amp; see what they do necessarily (if retained) drive us up unto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I shall consider how the Scriptures will fall in, to confirm and suit with that, which by those principles shall be found to be the <hi>Propria sedes</hi> of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>We use to make a <hi>Statue</hi> by cutting away of matter, as in carving a Statue out of free-stone, and so in what is left a form ariseth and it bears the image of what we intend (as well as we do it by adding to of matter as in making a <hi>statua</hi> of <hi>Playster,</hi> &amp;c.) and so here <hi>Praescindendo</hi> or by cutting away what will not serve for a <hi>sedes;</hi> the true form in such and such a matter will discover it self.</p>
                  <p>Now according to our Congregational principles received I believe we will agree in these particulars that follow, and if not, let the breach be made where any one thinks meet to make it upon them.</p>
                  <p>I shall in the first place set them down by way of Narration; the use and benefit of which Narrative will be to help us to discern the special value and tendency of this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, which, when all is done, must regulate this case. And also by degrees each of those particulars added to others coming up so far to the conclusion, thereby both the state of the Question will be seen, yea and perhaps some demonstration of it spring out of all at least to convince your judgments of the final conclusion which is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Congregational body to Christ, or Church, considered as such, and met as such, is the proper sole seat of this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, with difference from other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of worship and other meetings.</hi> Now towards the proof of this I advance by these steps.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That if the whole Congregational Church were met it must be a Minister who must dispense this ordinance, let the necessity of the Ordinance be what it will. Observe this that in cases of the most absolute necessity none will admit any other than a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister to administer it; and your best ground for that is (which I shall own) that weread not that any other but such administred it, or baptism in the New Testament, and every where we read that where the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper was administred it was by an whole Church, and so the argument for the negative is for this cause as good as for that other, <hi>viz.</hi> that Ministers only should administer it: Nay, we have more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances for the one than the other. And this also shews a manifest difference of the Lord's Supper from other ordinances. For if we consider publique prayers or preaching, gifted Brethren in cases of necessity may administer them, and yet you will not say this is common to the Lord's Supper which none but a Minister may administer. However for this first difference betwixt this and other Ordinances there must be some reason in the nature of the Ordinances themselves (for that it is the thing which in the first place I enquire) that should require and admit such a difference.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The qualification of being a Church-member, or of being in the order (as I may call it, Col. 2. 5.) of that state, is also as requisite as to a persons receiving the Lord's Supper; as that the person administring it should be in the order of preaching Eldership. This is acknowledged also, insomuch that the holyest man in the world (and who is known to all that society to be such, and to be utterly remote from the least jealousy of Scandal) who owneth not a Relation to some Church-membership, would not be admitted to this Sacrament by any of our Churches when met together.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third case is this, If some Members out of each or all Congregational Churches in <hi>England</hi> were met together in a Town, and a Minister of that Town were
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:154381:178"/> met with them (where some one Congregational Church resides, but yet, where at that time that Church he belongs unto as Minister are not met, but yet there is such a full Congregation of such Saints mentioned with testimonials from their respective Churches) he, according to our principles could not administer the Lord's Supper to them, and yet they are all qualified for it in this respect, that they are in the order of a Church, and in a Church-state as Church-members, so as the defect that it was in, in the former case, is taken away also hereby.</p>
                  <p>And if it be said they cannot be administred unto, because he that is the Minister is not <hi>their proper Minister,</hi> but not because they are not capacitated themselves for it, I add these steps more still by putting further Cases in the way of answer to this, and to shew that this defect is ultimately resolved into this, that, indeed, they are not a Church, for that is the ground of any Man's being their proper Minister.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If any Apostle were present he could not administer this Ordinance to them. We may make this supposition, for in the primitive times it might <hi>de facto</hi> have fallen out: Therefore, the above-mentioned defects doth not lye in their not having a proper Minister, for an Apostle, having an universal Relation of Office to all Churches and Saints, would be (so far as being a Minister of all parts therein lyes) sufficiently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But still there is a defect why this company of men could not have the Lord's Supper administred to them, and that, although qualified in being each a member of some Church; and where lyes the obstacle but in this, that they are not one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church, or members of one and the same Church amongst themselves? so that an Apostle's presence and power doth not extend to supply that defect, any more than to make a company of Disciples a Church without their Co-alition first so to be. We use to say that a company of Elders met in a Synod cannot have the Sacrament toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if <hi>Paul</hi> were with them, although they each do represent particular Churches. So as still (according to us) the Administration of the Sacrament farther depends upon these being one in the same, individual, particular Church-fellowship, which can be said of no ordinance else whatever.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If two or three of that Church were met, and a teaching Elder with them, he might pray with them, preach to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not administer this ordinance. The Evangelist <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> alone went together, and he could baptize him, but he could not have administred the Lord's Supper to him, so as still it is not sufficient that members of the same individual Church be met with a Teaching Elder. Thus still the administration of this Ordinance advanceth it self and climbeth up further and further towards its having for its seat that company of believers which ought to be accounted an whole particular Church.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is not <hi>a number</hi> of the Members of the same Church met with a teaching El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>which</hi> your priniples will allow capacitated for the Administration of this Ordinance. Yea, tho' it be supposed a number of so many and of such persons, that if there were a Church to be begun, there were a sufficient number for to make a Church (be it the <hi>minimum quod sic</hi> of seven (as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> says) or of ten, as in a Synagogue, or of eleven, as Christ's Disciples were when <hi>Judas</hi> was gone forth.) Yet your principles will not allow it. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then any such <hi>number</hi> met with a teaching Elder for other Religious worship might in the end say, Let us have the Sacrament also in the close, since God hath been with us in the other ordinances, and we are sufficient for number. But this you would not allow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there be a Church of five hundred, and as many teaching Officers as were in the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 13. 1. who would accordingly meet in so many several parcels as they had Teaching-Elders over them (one teaching Elder meeting with one parcel of many of them, another with a second <hi>many,</hi> a third with a third <hi>many,</hi> and so on) and would multiply their meetings according to the number of their Elders, this you would not allow neither, especially you would not admit such several Meetings for the Lord's upper at one and the same time. This yet is a case supposable and it may be put. <hi>S</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by cases put, we having brought the matter thus high, and thus near, it is to be considered what is here yet wanting or to be superadded to capacitate and endow them with power for this that the Lord's Supper may be administred in this case? Let any man of us either make a breach upon some or all of these principles, or assign wherein the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:154381:178"/> defect lyes, and as <hi>Peter</hi> said, what should forbid, that these should not be baptized? so let us enquire what doth forbid or hinder why these should not be the Seat of the Lord's Supper when so met; and when there are all requisites materially for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Saints in the Order of Church-fellowship.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the same individual Church-fellowship, and Members one of another in that respect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A Teaching-Elder in proper Relation unto them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A need (perhaps) of Edification of many of them, yea, and an earnest, spiritual and special longing after it at the meeting, and a great preparation made by other Ordinances unto it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The common Warrant (as for time) to receive this Ordinance <hi>oft (as oft as ye receive,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.) and so, both season and time do meet also. There is,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A sufficient number as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of a Church to make an whole Church according unto that, to which any principles of any profession amongst us Episcopalian, Presbyterian, or Anabaptists will say is required for a Church, and so it is in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect equivalent unto an whole Church. Wherein should the impediment lye? I press any man to assign it; but he that doth it must assign such a <hi>Ratio</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi> of this company to be superadded yet to them, as (taking into his eye all the fore-mentioned cases) shall carry with it a difference and distinct ground founded in the nature of the things, and he must compare them together.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With the Case of many Members of several other Churches so met with an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, who yet may not receive the Lord's Supper.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With the cases of two or three (but not arising to many) of their own Church met with their own Elder, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> who yet may not.</p>
                  <p>And yet 3. All these may enjoy any other Ordinance of worship, prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not this.</p>
                  <p>And 4. He must consider all these meetings to be of a distinct nature from a Church meeting of the whole Church, that is so acknowledged, in which, not the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only, but any or all other Ordinances of <hi>Discipline, Excommunication,</hi> &amp;c. may be administred, which cannot be in any of the other Companies. Let any, I say, whoever, weighing the premises, assign what <hi>Notio, conceptus,</hi> or <hi>Ratio</hi> (taking <hi>Ratio</hi> for the <hi>Modus, Relation</hi> or respect put upon a thing) is a-new or farther requisite to <hi>this Company of many,</hi> &amp;c. specified, and such a <hi>Notio</hi> also as will bear warrant and afford a true ground of difference of such a Church, both from the other Assemblies mentioned, and will also state a difference of this ordinance of the Lord's Supper from the other Ordinances, according to the variation of the cases put, and he will find himself driven up to what I shall by and by assign.</p>
                  <p>For, bring me two half-crown-pieces, the one stampt the other <hi>unstampt</hi> (which yet for matter and all such requisites belonging to the matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is, <hi>in valore,</hi> in value, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent unto an half-crown that is <hi>stamped)</hi> yet the unstampt piece is not constituted currant as Money to that purpose of payment as the other is; so it is in the present case.</p>
                  <p>The 7th. case propounded presents you with a <hi>many</hi> of Members of one and the same Church enough to begin a Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet you would not (out of times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution) in the modes of them propounded allow them capacitated for this admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, and yet they are, <hi>in valore,</hi> in value every way equivalent unto a Church which is immediately capable of this Administration. Let any Man now say what is the stamp that is to be superadded unto such a <hi>Company</hi> or <hi>Companies?</hi> Till others assign theirs I shall present what I conceive <hi>in abstracto</hi> this formal reason to be, <hi>viz.</hi> that a company of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> met, must be indued with this superadded <hi>Formality,</hi> with this <hi>Nova ratio formalis instituta;</hi> That it is a distinct body unto Christ, wherein the Members are united to one another as such, with distinction from other Churches that are also Instituted bodies to Christ.

                     </gap> Officer or Teaching Elder over them are the <hi>propria sedes, the proper seat,</hi> for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of this Sacrament, and unless this consideration is, or can be justified to be in such, or in any company, they are not capacitated for this Ordinance of the Lord's Supper. For otherwise it is not their <hi>Number,</hi> and their being members of one and the same Church and their meeting with an Elder, who is their own Elder, that will impower them for this Ordinance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In <hi>General,</hi> that there must be some farther <hi>formalis Ratio,</hi> some <hi>conceptus,</hi> or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:154381:179"/> superadded unto the materials of former instances (especially that last put) is evident.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because all things that go to compleat the matter do meet in that last instance.</p>
                  <p>There is, 1. A <hi>many.</hi> 2. <hi>Many</hi> of the same Church. 3. They are met with their own teaching Elder, and yet they are defective, and are not the proper seat of the Lord's Supper.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because there must some difference and distinction arise (besides what ariseth from these persons as the matter in this company) whereby they do and may become <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria sedes</hi> of this Ordinance with difference from all the former instances. Now dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences arise properly from the form, and so it must be <hi>Nova Ratio formalis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. It must be something <hi>instituted,</hi> a <hi>Ratio formalis instituta,</hi> (as I said.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is that which must make a difference and distinction from,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Company of Saints in no Church-Fellowship.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Company of Saints in several Church-Fellowships.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From two or three of the same Church-Fellowship.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From a <hi>many</hi> of the same.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And so as that whereas any such Company of the former may partake of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinance of worship, yet not of this. That which must be, to put the difference, must be <hi>Ratio formalis, instituta,</hi> as take as many men for number and (every way qualified and enabled, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> as are sufficient to make a Corporation fit to enjoy such or such priviledges, yet they must over and above be empowred by Charter, and over and above have superadded the seat of their being a Corporation by a Civil Institution; So it is here.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now secondly, for the demonstration of that particular <hi>formalis ratio instituta</hi> assigned, <hi>viz.</hi> That an instituted body to Christ considered as such is the only proper seat for this Ordinance, I shall proceed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By removing all suppositions I can think of or that have been suggested; or what may be pretended to give the stamp or institution, so as it will still remain that nothing else but such a company as I have before defin'd, may assume and take on them to be an instituted body to Christ.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not a <hi>Par Ratio</hi> a parity of Reason. <hi>The Church</hi> is said to have prayed for <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 12. 5. <hi>Peter therefore was kept in prison, but prayer was made without ceasing of the Church unto God for him;</hi> and this was done by two several meetings at least and so by parts of the Church, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>He came to an house where many were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together praying;</hi> and another company was elsewhere, as appears from what <hi>Peter</hi> says <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Go tell these things unto James and to the Brethren;</hi> and the words that follow are, <hi>And he departed and went into another place.</hi> But yet all this will no way come up to evince the matter we are upon, nor warrant that the stamp of being a Church may be put upon every assembly of many, nor will it follow that the Church may meet in parts for the Lord's Supper.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because prayer is such an ordinance as may be exercised by a Church by parcels, and those parcells may be fewer or more, whether their Office is met with them or not, as in one of the former instances was alledged that one Elder meeting with one sick person may pray with him, whereas if all the Elders met with that person they would not be capacitated to administer the Lord's Supper to that sick person. For if this had been the manner then, or an apostolical Practice, the Apostle <hi>James</hi> had as fit an occasion to have made mention of it and to have enjoyned it to be administred also by them, as well as to prayer over them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Sacrament is as needful for the Soul of such a Person as prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is for their body.</p>
                  <p>It may also be said that any two of the Church and the whole Church by two and two may meet to pray for any business of importance, but you will not say they may do so for this Ordinance; Yea they may do so without any Officer, as, two or three may meet for prayer, but not so for this Sacrament. And one reason is because this Ordinance is a <hi>Communion</hi> of Christ's body, and of one with another therein; but it is not so in the other Ordinance of Prayer, so as there is <hi>disparitas, a disparity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> For it would be a strange Assertion to say that two may meet for a Communion of Christ's body as well as to pray, and thereby exercise the Communion of Saints, which cannot be done apart, as well as by all, or many together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But the <hi>Phrase</hi> of <hi>Acts</hi> 12: 5. is urged, that prayer was made of the Church unto God for <hi>Peter</hi> (which how it was done the 12th. and 17th. <hi>verses</hi> shew, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:154381:179"/> That it was by parcels) and therefore the Church may be said to meet in several parcels; The reply is. </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. A Question may justly be made whether that phrase of <hi>Prayer being made of the Church without ceasing,</hi> refers us unto those Prayers that are afterward instanced to have been made by parcels of the Church, or whether that phrase is not intended to shew how the whole Church had during his being in prison met and made prayers for him; for unto the former whole time of his having been in prison doth that speech refer (view the words and compare, <hi>verse</hi> 4.) and those after-passages <hi>(v.</hi> 12, 17.) are but what fell out to be that night afore he was to appear next morning, <hi>verse</hi> 6. But I will not at all insist on this but will suppose that during this time of persecution all their meetings were by parcels as well as that night; though I believe that the assertion in the Answer given can never be disproved. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prayer may be said to be made by the Church in parcels, and yet it may be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that none of them were meetings of the Church as a Church. Tho', yet, if two by two had in such minute parcels met, yea if privately only one had earnestly prayed it might have been said, That prayer had been made by the Church thus distributed.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. The word <hi>Church</hi> in such a way of speech is taken materially for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, whether singly or otherwise, and when a thing is done by them generally either one way or another it may be said, <hi>The Church prayed,</hi> and it cannot be inferr'd that they prayed as met together, no more than to say, <hi>Prayer was made by the Churches,</hi> would argue they all met together for one prayer. And that the phrase of <hi>Church</hi> is so used in this Book of the <hi>Acts</hi> is evident, for when 'tis said <hi>(Acts</hi> 8. 1.) that there was <hi>a great persecution against the Church.</hi> The word <hi>Church</hi> is materially taken. So as the phrase <hi>(v.</hi> 5.) and those compared with it <hi>(v.</hi> 12. and 17.) will no way evidence that these meetings were Church-meetings or that they met <hi>qua</hi> Church, and so they had not the stamp which we seek: They were barely meetings of several members of that Church, and so the whole Church, indeed, might be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially in the one and in the other, but still it was not there <hi>qua</hi> Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The nature of the duty of prayer is unquestionably such, as will admit a Church to perform it by parcels greater or lesser, yea in its members singly. And how then can we interpret this phraseology, in <hi>Acts</hi> 12. to serve that purpose for which it is urg'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay 3. The Holy Ghost hath warily penned it to present such an interpretation, for he styles the meeting of those in <hi>verse</hi> 12. (where it is said, <hi>Many were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether praying)</hi> in distinction from being a Church, or the Church, or a Church-meeting, and so it in reality comes up but to that seventh or last instance we gave of many of the same Church-meeting, to whom yet you would not give the Supper. And as for the other company, who are called <hi>James</hi> and the <hi>Brethren,</hi> we will suppose them met as these <hi>Many (v.</hi> 12.) were, and yet so much is not said there, but the meaning may be that <hi>Peter</hi> bid them to go to their several houses. They are but the <hi>Brethren</hi> with <hi>James,</hi> not the Church, though <hi>James,</hi> their chief Elder, had been met with them.</p>
                  <p>Yea, 4. There will fall out this contradiction to what is said in the 5th. <hi>v.</hi> if you say that these were each formal Church-meetings. For then it must have been said that they met in <hi>distinct Churches,</hi> and not that <hi>that Church, in singulari</hi> met in each of these meetings, <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is not the will or consent of that which we must call the whole Church (the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) that can have authority to set this new stamp of a <hi>Church</hi> upon such partial Meetings of its own Members.</p>
                  <p>For 1. Tho' in Law Estates or Titles are convey'd, both by the will of man in making his will, and by inheritance, yet here, the adopting any or all of these meetings apart, into the priviledge of a Church, goes not by the <hi>will of Man.</hi> But look what Company is so met as by the will, and institution of God, the inheritance falls upon, they only are the Church. The Church's will gives not the stamp, but it must be such in the reality afore God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the will of the Church had this pretended authority, then the whole Church may say of any such few or many of the members at any time met, that they are a Church, and that others, tho' many, are not so. Yea,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then it may be said of as many several Companys that have each an elder with them, that they are so many Churches; and if all these receive at the same time the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:154381:180"/> Sacrament, they would be so many Churches made by that one whole Church and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that one Church; whereas an instituted Church consists in <hi>Indivisibili.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is not considered enough that the authority of being a Church is not <hi>Potestas vicaria nor deputata, A vicarious, or deputed power.</hi> Therefore the whole Church cannot say, This shall be your Church at such or such a time, for such or such an end.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not a case of necessity for the Ordinance, that will be argument sufficient for the administration of it to any such divided parcels of a Church. For put this case that many of the same Church are in case of great disconsolation and therefore need this ordinance, or that they have not had this Ordinance of a long time administred to them, and one of their proper Ministers were with them. Yea, put the case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity which the Papists and our Episcopal Divines put, that two or three or more are sick and weak in a great Family belonging to one Church, and being near death in all view, they as greatly long for, yea, more need this ordinance, <hi>in agone mortis,</hi> in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony of death, than any other company of Church-Members in case of persecution: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these cases will be allowed to be such a necessity as would make or constitute such a meeting to be a Body unto Christ, instituted with difference from another part of that Church.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Whether, in case of apparent danger of Life, loss of Estate rationally foreseen, or in case of violence and force, causing Ordinances to cease, there may not be a prudent forbearance or secret avoidance?</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Rule our Saviour gives, <hi>I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> is our measure and standard to forbear Ordinances in the Case mentioned; for it is <hi>Mercy</hi> which God would rather have. Sacrifice was the eminent Ordinance of the old Testament in all the ages of it, yet, it being but a duty of the second Commandment or Instituted worship and not of the first, it yields unto mercy, as also the duties of the Sabbath do, as our Saviour Christ hath also declared and paralell'd that with the duties of the second Commanded, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
                  <p>But I shall give instances of such a Forbearance which confirm this, and shew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this Rule.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I shall produce Instances out of the old Testament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Jacob</hi> fled from his Fathers house when <hi>Esau</hi> had but spoken words of threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 41. <hi>And</hi> Esau <hi>said in his heart the days of mourning for my Father are at hand, then will I slay my Brother</hi> Jacob; <hi>And these words of</hi> Esau, <hi>his elder Son, were told</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, <hi>and she sent and called</hi> Jacob <hi>her younger Son, and said to him, Behold, thy Brother</hi> Esau <hi>as touching thee doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.</hi> Here was but a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say and report of <hi>Esau</hi>'s intention, and yet thereupon his Mother advises him to flee to <hi>Laban</hi> to <hi>Haran,</hi> verse 43. but to do it only to avoid the present distress, hoping his Brothers fury would be over as the word is, <hi>verse</hi> 44, 45. <hi>And tarry thou with him a few days until thy Brother's fury turn away; until thy Brothers anger turn away from thee</hi> (that is, the fury of his anger be over) <hi>and he forget that which thou hast done to him, then will I send and fetch thee from thence.</hi> And he did accordingly and had <hi>Isacc</hi>'s blessing with him also <hi>(Gen.</hi> 28. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) and was sent away by his Authority; and yet, consider the Case how it stood; He went away from his Fathers house where God was worshipt, and where Sacrifices were offered; for so in the Patriarchs Families they were, and had been from the beginning, from <hi>Adam, Abel,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and so on. Yet, to avoid this fury he fled to a Family, where a strange God was worshipt (for we read that <hi>Laban</hi> did swear to another God than <hi>Jacob</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 53. <hi>viz.</hi> The God which <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Nahor</hi> had worshipt before <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Conversion, Josh. 24. 15. <hi>The Gods which your Fathers served that were on the other side of the flood:</hi> That <hi>Laban</hi> was an Idolater also appears by the said, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 30. <hi>Wherefore hast thou stollen my Gods?</hi> compared with <hi>verse</hi> 34.) and his flying was but a matter of prudence, it was but for a danger threatned: He was not yet surprized, but it seemed rationally impendent. And also it was but for a time, but not for always, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:154381:180"/> his Mother (as <hi>Ainsworth</hi> says) counsell'd him in Faith; yea, and farther <hi>Isaac</hi> sent him away with a blessing as from God. And there was this farther in the case, that he having bought the birth-right of his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> if his Father (who was so old, that he was striken with blindness, and <hi>Esau,</hi> in his speech, had implyed that it would not be long to his death) had dyed, it was he that should have Officiated in the Priest's Office in the Family, and have performed the worship of the Family, as having bought the birth-right; and so was the head thereof in that respect. How soon his Father might dye he knew not, and yet he fled, and fled upon this occasion and with this reserve, till his Brother's fury should be over.</p>
                  <p>I might from hence urge an argument against what is ordinarily alledged by people in our times, who, in the case of eminent danger, tell their teachers and one another, <hi>You must trust God,</hi> and not avoid or forbear.</p>
                  <p>I reply, why should not he have trusted God against such fears as these, which were indeed but from flying speeches of his brother? but because it was rationally probable that his Brother would indeed have killed him, he therefore flyes to avoid it, but when indeed God really did call him to trust him, as when his brother <hi>Esau</hi> came with 400 men against him, he then trusted God, and prayed it out; but in this case, he was not called to do it, but wholly to avoid it rather.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Sacrifice, and to worship God together in Assemblies had been the Religion of their fore fathers transmitted to them from before the flood, as appears from the first, in the case of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> Gen. 4. and from the 26. <hi>v.</hi> of that Chap. <hi>Then men began to call upon the name of the Lord,</hi> that is, to call upon him together. But while they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the people did forbear Sacrifices and publique worship, Exod. 8. 25, 26, 27. Pharaoh <hi>called for</hi> Moses <hi>and for</hi> Aaron <hi>and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the Land. And</hi> Moses <hi>said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall Sacrifice the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Egyptians to the Lord our God: Lo! shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? we will go three day's journey into the willderness, and sacrifice to the Lord our God, as he shall command us. videtur colligi</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rivettus in Locum.</note>
                     <hi>non fuisse liberum; it seems to be inferr'd, that it was not free, Sacrificia offerre,</hi> no not in their own dwellings <hi>for them to offer Sacrifices,</hi> no not in their own dwellings in <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shen,</hi> or if they did it, they did it but <hi>secretly.</hi> And it is for certain that publick Sacrifices and meetings were not used; for it is but now granted as a special favour by <hi>Pharaoh, Go, Sacrifice in the Land,</hi> as that which they had not done afore, and they forbore upon a prudential ground (when yet according to the principles of trusting God in any case, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if they were true, they ought not to have foreborn) they knew not infallibly and certainly, that the people would stone them, and yet thereupon <hi>Moses</hi> says, <hi>It is not meet so to do,</hi> verse 26. <hi>for we shall Sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? we will go three days journey into the wilderness, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Lord our God.</hi> Which argues further that they knew their Fathers had offered up Sheep and Oxen; and so it was not out of Ignorance that they forebore, as if they knew not what God would accept.</p>
                  <p>From the transactions of <hi>Moses,</hi> this may clearly also be argued, that if, in case any person be to enter into a state of Church-Ordinances (which Sacrifice was then more eminently in the room of) or to joyn with a set company and with a Pastor suitable to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which hitherto they have not done, they may warrantably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear and wait a due and fit season for it in a setled way. Or if a man intended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move for ordinances to another Country he were not bound (perhaps for some good space of time) to enter presently into them in the place where he is, or upon the next opportunity, which will present it self. Also in that case of a dangerous opposition from their Relations, such as, by reason of their Spirits and Principles, do threaten to break all between them; we do use rightly in such a case to advise, that Wives and Children are not so bound up to do it, but they may forbear to gain the consent of such Relations. And our Argument we account strong, because, for present enjoyment, we are not to hazard or prejudice a future more settled and quiet enjoyment, which yet truly hath much of the case afore us: For we only profess to forbear at particular times, wherein there appears, rationally, a more certain danger, to preserve our selves and our Estates to enable us to enjoy them more frequently at other times, and not to expend all your future enjoyments upon one present, and spend (as it were) the whole of all at once. And this is truly <hi>Mercy</hi> and is the same kind of Sacrifice too, <hi>viz.</hi> for the future instead of Sacrifice at present.</p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:154381:181"/>
                  <p> Now all this is justifiably inferred from the Case of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from the time that <hi>Moses</hi> presented himself as a deliverer unto them, for seeing deliverance was at hand, why did they not presently fall upon Sacrificing? Why doth <hi>Moses</hi> defer the time, and not set upon it presently? It was not that the duty of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was not inforce, for it had been (as Christ says of Circumcision) from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and obliged them as well as their fore-fathers, especially when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had given liberty, saying, <hi>Go Sacrifice in the Land.</hi> No, but he defers it, to work about another thing, <hi>viz.</hi> a total deliverance, and sacrifizeth the present enjoyment they might have had unto the attainment of a future settled enjoyment. He forbears at present, that the present performing it for once might not hinder the future for a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. During <hi>Saul</hi>'s wicked Reign, there was no frequenting the Ark, which yet was the Ordinance of God, 1 Chron. 13. 3. <hi>Let us bring again the Ark of our God, for we enquired not at it in the days of</hi> Saul. I omit <hi>David</hi>'s flying from <hi>Saul,</hi> and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his dwelling in <hi>Meshech,</hi> and his saying, <hi>O that I were a Sparrow, a Door-keeperl in the house of God,</hi> Psa. 84. 3, 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We have another instance in the Case of the ten Tribes all the days of the Kings of <hi>Israel.</hi> There was in <hi>Elia</hi>'s Time 7000 had not bowed to <hi>Baal,</hi> but they kept themselves from the defilement of Idols conscientiously (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 18.) and yet they went not unto ordinances at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to Temple-worship, nor did not during all those times, which were well nigh 250 years, nor do we find them any where blamed for it. Yea, and surely, had they been observant thereof, it would have been here remembred by God for the evidence of their sincerity, as well as that Negative of not bowing unto <hi>Baal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Objection be, that of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the rest of the Kings, it is indigitated, that he made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin, namely, in their notgoing up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> as well as in worshipping his Calves.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>Answer,</hi> 1. That the sin of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the Kings that imposed both, did lye in both, <hi>viz.</hi> in restraying them from their going to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> as well as in requiring their worshipping his Calves, &amp; the ultimateaim on his part was to keep them from going to <hi>Jerusalem, If this people go up to Sacrifice in the house of the Lord at</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their</hi> Lord, <hi>even unto</hi> Rehoboam <hi>King of</hi> Judah, <hi>and they shall kill me, and go again to</hi> Rehoboam <hi>King of</hi> Judah: Yet the sin imputed to the people is eminently if not limitedly said to be their worshipping of the Calves, 1 Kin. 12. 29, 30. <hi>And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. And this thing became a sin; for the people went to worship before the one even unto</hi> Dan.</p>

                  <p>But 3. Still those Godly people who kept themselves from the worship of his Calves (as certainly they did, as the prophets also did) and being under this hard restraint which hath been spoken of, and Mourners for it, to them simply their forbearance to go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was not imputed as a sin, nor is any where found to have been so charged on them.</p>
                  <p>And that the greatest of the Prophets themselves did in that as well as in other Cases of danger betake themselves to ways of prudence to secure and save themselves after the most <hi>Heroick</hi> darings, and durst not abide by it; you have <hi>Elias</hi> for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. <hi>Elias,</hi> indeed, once daringly offered a great Sacrifice, and gained thereupon the people to kill 800 of <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests, in the midst of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s and <hi>Jezebel</hi>'s Reign, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. But when he had done, he stayed not by it, but to save himself he betook himself to his heels and run away and went as far as his Legs could carry him, clear out of all <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Dominions and reach, 40 days Journey, even to <hi>Mount Horeb,</hi> where the Law was given, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 8.</p>
                  <p>Some further Objections may arise from the Adventures and seeming Hazards of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine, that many godly of the 10 Tribes at several times made to come to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to Sacrifice. There were three special times in which we read that many of that people after the beginning of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Reign went up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Then when the Division had been first made by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> during the space of 3 years.</item>
                     <item>2. In the days of <hi>Asa</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Baasha</hi> king of those ten Tribes, some 15 years after <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s death, another irruption out of some of the 10 Tribes came unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 9.</item>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:154381:181"/>
                     <item> 3. The third was just at the last, even but 5 years afore the final ruine of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Of any other times we read not (that I know of) of any one's going up unless you will credit that which old <hi>Tobit</hi> says of himself, <hi>Tobit</hi> 1. 6. <hi>I went often alone unto</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem <hi>to the feasts;</hi> and what the Angel is brought in to say <hi>(Chap.</hi> 5.) of two more that accompanied him at some of those times. Yet there it is not he always went when it was duty as well to do so, but only often, and that he alone did it, not others of the godly of that Nation in his days.</p>
                  <p>Now the Circumstances of those three times specified and the Condition of that people are to be enquired into that it may appear why then it was done by the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not at other times (that are recorded) as that which will give a difference in the case, and give light to us in the point in hand, when to adventure and when not, for 'twill be found that none of these three Instances in the Circumstances of them will rise up to prove such an absolute obligation unto instituted Ordinances, but as may stand with mercy shewn to our selves in our lives, preservation of our lives, and of our Families from ruine. I shall therefore make a particular enquiry into the Circumstances of all these three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As touching that first flush or breaking forth of <hi>goers to</hi> Jerusalem, when it was but young-tide with <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his Government, we read, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 11. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>And the Priests and Levites that were in all</hi> Israel <hi>resorted to</hi> Rehoboam <hi>out of all their coasts (for the Levites left their suburbs, and their possessions, and came to</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem: <hi>for</hi> Jeroboam <hi>and his Sons had cast them off from executing the Priest's Office unto the Lord; and he ordained him Priests for the high places, and for the Devils, and for the Calves which he had made) and after them out of all the Tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the Lord God of Israel came to Jerusalem to Sacrifice unto the Lord God of their fathers.</hi> But the Circumstances of the times and condition of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons must be therein considered.</p>
                  <p>As, 1. That this was done at that time when this alteration together with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was first made, and (which also is to be taken along) was practised by the people; but the three first years, as v. 17. hath it: and although <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was thus rigid from the first towards the Priests and Levites (of which by and by) yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beginning of his Government (when <hi>Politique</hi> Princes proceed by degrees) it may well be supposed that his being King depending much upon the people, he was a while more slack and conniving at the people; and indeed his first Declaration (I call it so rather then Edict) concerning the Calves and their going up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was (as to them) published in softer and milder and but exhortatory terms, and without pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties that we read of at first annexed, as appears, 1 Kings 12. 28. <hi>Whereupon the King took counsel, and made two Calves of Gold, and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem, behold thy Gods, O Israel,</hi> &amp;c. It was but a presenting to them another worship and trying first how it would take with them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The condition both of Priests and People is to be considered, to put the difference, between this and after times.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider the condition of the Priests and Levites who began first. as <hi>v.</hi> 13. 14. It is apparent that their Removal was Total and forced and absolutely necessitated. They could not choose, unless they would become Priests to serve <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Calves, for refusing which it was <hi>Jeroboam</hi> began with them. 'Twas he and his Sons had cast them off from executing the Priest's Office, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14. and so their lively-hood and maintenance utterly ceased, for their portion always had been to live upon <hi>Jura templi, upon the revenues due by God's law to the Priests as serving the Temple,</hi> as you read, <hi>Num.</hi> 18. <hi>Deut,</hi> 18. and <hi>Josh.</hi> 18. all which ceased in <hi>Israel</hi> then with their Non exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Priest's Office. Only, it seems he left it yet free to them to continue in their dwellings, for'tis said, those <hi>they left, their suburbs,</hi> as v. 14. for, alas! what would that have conduced to their Maintenance, they having no inheritance or Lot of Lands? but on the contrary, if they would remove to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (which at this dawn of his Government it seems <hi>Jeroboam</hi> yet hindred them not from but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them) there they had a service at the Temple waited for them; for in their Courts they were there to serve. They had also a maintenance by God's appointment set out for them, and the Priest's self-denyal in this was but as that of Priests and Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites now with us in <hi>England,</hi> who, if they be banished from thence have yet Colledges and Monasteries and Universities to retire unto, where they have employments and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:154381:182"/> other service to do and maintenance ready for them; which different case of theirs from others, who, if banished, have meer nothing to betake themselves to, is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough considered and laid to heart. Yea, as things stood, it was every way their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and advantage in this distress to take this course of resorting to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> out of all <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then 2. For <hi>the People</hi> who <hi>after them</hi> (as 'tis said) both <hi>after</hi> that time, and after their example, came to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> also; besides that (as was said) they as yet had no positive prohibition to the contrary (tht we read of) further, it is not apparent at al that they did for these three years remove their Stations from out of <hi>Israel,</hi> but keeping their houses and their Lands still did only go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to Sacrifice at the usual times, and so it is <hi>only</hi> said of them, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 16. <hi>They came to Jerusalem to Sacrifice unto the Lord God of their Fathers;</hi> and because this is spoken with an observable difference from what had been said of the removal of the Priests <hi>(verse</hi> 13, 14.) that they also <hi>left their dwellings,</hi> &amp;c. and that the people here are barely said to go <hi>to Sacrifice:</hi> Hence therefore it seems more than probable that these peoples going was only at the feasts for Sacrifice, but they returned again to their own dwellings and lively-hoods in <hi>Israel</hi> as in former times they had been wont to do. And if so, then this clearly argues that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>'s Laws (if any concerning them were yet made) were not as then so severe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the peoples going up (that is, not for these three first years) as afterwards they were, when by the experience of their going up during those three years he saw that the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> was <hi>strengthened thereby,</hi> v. 17. And that but three years are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned argues that then they ceased any more so to go up.</p>
                  <p>On the other hand if the case of this people had not stood thus free in this respect for those three first years (as hath been argued) but that they should be thought ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to have quitted their Station, it had been far harder with them than with the Priests and Levites, and indeed unsuportable. And the vast difference between the case of the Priests and the People (if thus stated) is very apparent. For the Priests and Levites left but meer dwelling-houses, but had a provision for them though perhaps less in <hi>Judah</hi> upon their removal, but the people, if they removed were to leave in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances in Lands, Vineyards, Orchards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they already possessed in <hi>Israel,</hi> and that alloted them by God, which if <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had been so severe with them at first, as is supposed, they could not have sold them neither, for he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them in that also, and if they had liberty to have sold them, it had been but for the time till the year of the next Jubilee by the Law, which to many, would have been but little profit, for it was but 20 years at the utmost, as the Bishop of <hi>Ardmach</hi> reckons them, others but 14 between <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s very beginning of his Reign unto the next Jubilee which was the 10. And when they should have come unto Judah they could not have brought any other lands of inheritance there, for those that were that time dwellers allready had their inheritances fixt to them by Divine right, they were, <hi>bona immobilia,</hi> immovable Goods, which they could not sell longer than the next Jubilee, when they must have returned, and so these poor <hi>Israelites</hi> should have had nothing to have lived upon, no, nor to employ themselves in, in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> if thither they had removed.</p>
                  <p>Neither had they any ground (for ought I know that may be gathered out of the story) to hope for any support or encouragement either from that people of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> or <hi>Rehoboam</hi> who was not a godly Prince nor sincerely hearty to the cause of Religion, but (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 1.) <hi>After he had established the Kingdom</hi> (once) <hi>and had strengthened himself he forsook the Law of the Lord and all Israel with him.</hi> And in that former place alledged 'twas but those three first years that he and they <hi>walkt in the ways of</hi> David <hi>and</hi> Solomon, upon which it may therefore well be supposed that the Godly people of these ten tribes ceased to go up to worship, though in the end he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself, and <hi>things went well again in</hi> Judah, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 12.</p>
                  <p>But then that after those three first years <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s severity interrupted any from going up (as we read of that none did) is very likely and most probable, for of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> it is particularly said that he began to use force and violence to keep the people from going up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as the summary account which God gives why he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved that nation wholly, at the last shews, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 21. <hi>Jeroboam drave the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from following the Lord,</hi> that is, from their going up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> for, indeed, in that did his main interrest lye, and his Calves was but a device to divert them to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other worship; and that word, <hi>drave from,</hi> imports violence to have been used. And
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:154381:182"/> this way of severity begun by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> was continued by other of their Kings both by severe Laws, as the statutes of <hi>Omri,</hi> mentioned <hi>(Mic.</hi> 6. 16.) shew whose Statutes are therefore mentioned, because he was under more strict penalties then ever had enacted the observation of the things which <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had first brought in. For unto the level of what <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had done <hi>Omri</hi>'s wickedness is limited, 1 Kings 16. 26. <hi>For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the Son of a Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</hi> And therefore those his Statutes in <hi>Micah</hi> are to be understood as more severely backing what <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had begun, and this <hi>Omri,</hi> who made these Laws, began his Reign not past 30 years after <hi>Jeroboams</hi> death; so that it did rise up to the highest severities very <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Rivet. <hi>on</hi> Hos. 5. 1.</note> soon. And as he was severe by Laws, so also, by way-laying any that should go up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which the <hi>Jewish</hi> writers do affirm their Kings did, and how they set <note place="margin">Jeroboam <hi>ut asseritur satis rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit custodes in terminis regni, ne quis de reguo suo ascenderetin</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>et qui ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derent caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entur &amp; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciderentur et confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur opera eorum.</hi> Tost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus <hi>on</hi> 2 Chr. 11. <hi>quaest</hi> 17.</note> guards and built watch-towers, on purpose, at the passages and ways to take and kill them that attempted to go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and confiscated their Goods, and they do say that, that place, <hi>Hosea</hi> 5. 1. is an allusion to that practice which their former Kings had used upon <hi>Mount Tabor</hi> and <hi>Mispeh,</hi> whereon (says the <hi>Jewish writers)</hi> they had placed watch-towers and centinels as gins and snares to catch any that should attempt to go up to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> these two places being out-lets into the dominion of <hi>Judah</hi> from some part of Israel. And that this was one way and course taken up &amp; continued by these Kings, those Scriptures, do expresly relate. For of <hi>Baasha</hi> that succeeded but two years after <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> it is there said, <hi>Baasha King of Israel went up against Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa King of Judah.</hi> Now <hi>Ramah</hi> was on the borders of <hi>Benjamin</hi> in the way to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and one fresh occasion of this design had been that (as 2 Chr. 15. 9. relates it) Many in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance out of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manasses</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> had fallen to <hi>Asa,</hi> and came out from those Tribes to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for the worship of God's sake. And <hi>Ramah</hi> which he attempted to build was the direct passage for those particular Tribes to go into <hi>Judah</hi> by.</p>
                  <p>The Second out breaking over the banks which the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> had raised up to restrain their Subjects from inundations into <hi>Judah,</hi> is recorded, 2 Chr. 15. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>He</hi> (viz. <hi>Asa) gathered all Judah and Benjam in and the strangers with them out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim and Manasseth and out of Simeon (for they fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the Lord his God was with him) so they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third Month, in the 15th. year of the Reign of Asa. And they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto the Lord, the same time, of the spoil which they had brought, seven hundred Oxen and seven thousand sheep. And they entred into a Covenant to seek the Lord God of their Fathers with all their hearts and with all their Soul, that whosoever would not seek the Lord God of Israel should be put to death whether small or great, whether Man or Woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We see this was a Flowing in abundance, and there were two persuasives of them to it, 1 God's prospering <hi>Asa.</hi> 2. Their desires to worship God. Yet here in like manner the Circumstances of that juncture of time, as also of the persons (who and what Tribes these were) are to be duly weighed, and will still serve to contribute light to us in this great point, both as under what rationally probable apprehensions men are called to adventure for the enjoyment of Ordinances in the times of such distress; as also in what cases and Circumstances, they are to do it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the persons (who and of what Tribes) although the number of them was in a great abundance yet but three Tribes only are specified; and so interpreters do much narrow it unto the Godly of these Tribes, <hi>Ephraim, Manasseth and Simeon.</hi> To clear which it must be further considered;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That a good part of <hi>Ephraim</hi> (called elsewhere in this Story <hi>Mount Ephraim,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 8. that is the Mountainous part of that Country) had been already brought under the Dominion of the King of <hi>Judah</hi> since <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Revolt; first some by <hi>Abijah</hi> this <hi>Asa</hi>'s Father, 2 Chron. 13. 19. <hi>Abijah persued after Jeroboam and took Cities from him, Bethel with the Towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the Towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and Ephraim with the Towns thereof.</hi> And those Cities were not recovered again by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> or their Kings, as <hi>verse</hi> 20. shews. Then again, more and other Cities had been taken by this King <hi>Asa</hi> himself, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 8.</p>
                  <p>Other Cities were taken by him, besides the former by his Father, for it would not have been first there, and then again so expresly over and again said that <hi>Asa</hi> had
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:154381:183"/> taken Cities if they had been no other than those Cities his Father <hi>Abijah</hi> had taken afore him; and all these <hi>Jehoshaphat</hi> possest in his time also, as that 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17. shews. Now this part of <hi>Ephraim</hi> bordered upon <hi>Benjamin,</hi> which was in the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>'s Lot, as in <hi>Josh.</hi> c. 16. and c. 18. appears.</p>
                  <p>Then 2. The Tribe of <hi>Simeon</hi> here specified, lay so near the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> as it had been antiently a part thereof, and reckoned <hi>within it, Josh.</hi> 19. 1. And then the three Tribes, <hi>viz. Manasses, Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> were adjoyning to one another, <hi>Josh.</hi> ch. 16. and 17.</p>
                  <p>So all these being immediate Borderers, and some of the Cities being already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the dominion of <hi>Judah,</hi> no wonder if many of those Tribes also fell in with <hi>Asa</hi> (especially if withal you take in the Circumstances that follow) and perhaps fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many whole Cities of these Tribes, besides those formerly taken by them fell in, and not only particular persons out of them. And the way lying so open and fair to go forth out of these three Tribes unto <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> it is the less wonder that they should in such abundance come up thither, whereas others of the Godly Tribes, among them lying further off and remote, were cooped up and utterly debarred, disabled, and invincibly hindred from so falling in with him as these did, and therefore none of them are mentioned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Circumstances of the time were exceeding promising &amp; inviting of them thus to fall in. And they were such, as I believe that every man will say, that if any God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zealous Christians were environed with the same in the like case, they would, and ought to do the like in any age for the enjoyment of the Ordinances of God. Let but the face of the Sky and of the times be considered with their difference from other times as both by the Prophecies of the prophets of that age and providence concurring they lay afore them then, and it must be said that it was in its self the best choice they could make for themselves (according as was meet for them to judge) to fall in to <hi>Asa,</hi> as things lay afore them, and to have done this, tho' there had not been this superadded invitement (the greatest of all other) that they should have the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God to boot. And this we may not assert, although we suppose withal that many of them had quitted their possessions, for all needed not to do so in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> from which City, and the worship of God there, their Brethren in other Tribes were utterly debarred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Circumstances of these persons who thus came to Jerusalem, were these;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In general, they had had many demonstrations and convictions from God of his wrath against their Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and against the People, who willingly continued to cleave to them, and who declared for this very thing of their Calves, and for the driving of <hi>Israel</hi> from the true worship.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They saw an instance of this wrath of God by prophecy and a Miracle accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it at the very Altar of <hi>Bethel</hi> one of the new Chapels, whilst <hi>Jeroboam</hi> stood there to offer incense, the Altar cleaving in two, and the ashes falling our, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet crying out against it, <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s hand dryed up whilst he stretcht it out to lay hold on the prophet for so crying. You read the story of this, 1 Kings 13. and this fell out within the memory of these <hi>Israelites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then 2. It would have amazed any man to have seen <hi>Jeroboam</hi> for ever after so unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, to have observed that fatal slaughter of five hundered thousand Men (a slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so great as was never read of afore or since any where in the world) out of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of eight hundred thousand, and that but by half the number of the King of <hi>Judah</hi>'s men; and this was done when the issue and tryal of the battle was in an appeal to God put upon this very gage and cause of <hi>Judah</hi>'s retaining the true worship, and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>'s having set up a false (2 Chron. 14. from the 4. <hi>v.</hi> to the end) To see these Cities taken from him, yea and his <hi>Bethel</hi> too, and himself so weakened as never to recover strength again.</p>
                  <p>Then, 3. It was an astonishing sight to see <hi>Jeroboam</hi> himself at last struck to death by some extraordinary immediate stroke of God <hi>The Lord struck him that he died,</hi> says the text, in the 1 Kings 13. 19, 20.</p>
                  <p>Then, 4. It was an affrighting consideration to have prophecy upon prophecy issued forth against his house, and one of the loudest of them as it were drawn upon himself whilst he himself of his own motion would needs send his wife <hi>Incognitio</hi> and disguised to <hi>Abijah</hi> the prophet, 1 Kings 14. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Behold I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:154381:183"/>
                     <hi>is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung till it be all gone. Him that dyeth of Jeroboam in the City shall the Dogs eat, and him that dyeth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat; for the Lord hath spoken it. Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own houses, and when thy feet enter into the City the Child shall die:</hi> Of the certainty of the fulfilling of all which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets gave him a present and as sad a sign. <hi>The Child shall die</hi> (says he) and he names the very time and hour of his Sons death, <hi>verse</hi> 12. <hi>When thy foot enters the City;</hi> and in the 14. <hi>v.</hi> he declares how it would be that God would raise up a King, <hi>viz. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asha,</hi> that should execute and perform all this, and do it within a very small space. <hi>And when was it to be done? Even now,</hi> says God, v. 14. that is, <hi>I will not stay long, but make quick work with them, I will do it presently;</hi> and he performed all this according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s son, and all his posterity within less than two years, some say, less than one after <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s own death; and of this thing this people (we are speaking of who here fell in with <hi>Asa)</hi> knew; for these things, <hi>viz.</hi> both the prophecies and these events thereof newly fulfilled afore their eyes, were not done in a Corner, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple knew this very sin to be the Cause of all this.</p>
                  <p>Then, 5. It must needs have a great influence on these persons, to have heard (which came more home to touch them) the same prophets with the same breath to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced a fatal Captivity and destruction of that whole Nation of the ten Tribes as that which should be the end &amp; issue of these sins, v. 14, 15. <hi>Moreover, the Lord shall raise him up a King over Israel, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day; but when? even now. For the Lord shall smite Israel as a reed is shaken in the water, and shall root up Israel out of this good Land which he gave to their Fathers, and shall scatter them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River, because they have made their groves, provoking the Lord to anger.</hi> And this is uttered indefinitely for time, for no time is set or named when it should be, for ought they knew, it might be that or the next year; and they having had so signally seen the former part of that prophecy, <hi>Even now,</hi> fulfilled, they might well tremble to think that this Captivity and Destruction threatned of the whole Tribes might, they knew not how soon, come upon them and their posterity together with the whole Nation in common if they were found in the same sin.</p>
                  <p>Then 6. Another thing which had an influence upon them was, To behold the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> (these two last of them especially) one after the other to be holy, good men, and every way to prosper; yea even the Grand-father of these two, <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> (from whom God rent the Kingdom) so to be favour'd, that in his last times <hi>things went well in Judah,</hi> and after him his Son <hi>Abijah,</hi> a godly Prince, to have so great a victory, as was mentioned, and to grow <hi>mighty</hi> thereupon (as in an opposition to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>'s decay, it is spoken of him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 21.) And then to see this <hi>Asa</hi> now Reigning, the third King, an holier man, to see how he still to be so prospered, as to have with a few so great a Victory against the <hi>Cushites,</hi> as to rout an Army of a <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men</hi> and more, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.) and to take all the spoil of them, together with the spoil of all the Cities about <hi>Gerar</hi> from their Confederates <hi>The PHILIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINES.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then 7. It moved them, when they saw, hereupon, a new Prophet sent from God to <hi>Asa</hi> and all his Subjects and Compliants with him to revive the memory afresh, and their ears to rehearse the sum of these things to them, and so spread afore them the infinite vast difference God had put between him with them of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the people of the ten Tribes; and this done on purpose to hearten and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them that God would still be with them and reward their work, setting afore them what and how great miseries had followed one upon the neck of another unto those of the Ten Tribes.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the beginning of this 15. chap. ver. 3. <hi>Now for a long season,</hi> saith he, (namely, from <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s setting up) <hi>hath Israel been,</hi> v. 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>without the true God and without a teaching Priest, and without Law. But when they, in their trouble, did turn unto the Lord God of Israel, and sought him, he was found of them. And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were upon all the inhabitants of the Country: Nation was destroyed of Nation, and City of City; for God did vex them with all adversity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth verse <hi>Piscator</hi> Renders, interpreting the whole round about it of the time past, that if so be <hi>Israel</hi> (namely the ten Tribes) had turned, when trouble was upon them, unto the Lord God of <hi>Israel,</hi> he had been found of them seeking of him. The Vulgar Translation reads all this in the future, as if the Prophet
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:154381:184"/> Prophet laid afore them what for time to come would certainly be the condition of those Tribes, as thus, <hi>Israel shall be for a long season</hi> (yet to come) <hi>without God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And in those times there shall be no peace to him that comes out or in, but great vexation shall be,</hi> &amp;c. verse 5, 6. And the Original admitting either interpretation I should take both to be intended; and I am sure that in the event and matter of fact, both had been the Condition of these ten Tribes and had continued to be so more or less until their final Captivity. But whether it be a Narrative either of what had befallen them, or should hereafter befal them, or both, it serves all fully to the mainpurpose I cite the Prophet for, which was to move and hearten them of <hi>Judah</hi> (who both had had, and he promiseth should have for the most part clean contrary dispensations from God) to set up a reformation of the publique worship of God, and together with them to hearten also the godly of the ten Tribes (that possibly any way could do it) to come over unto them (as <hi>v</hi> 9. we read they did) and to leave their interest amongst those ten Tribes, and to give themselves up unto the Lord and his worship as the most safe and secure allotment, they, in those times, could any way betake themselves unto. And that the prophet speaks all this as of a different condition of <hi>Israel</hi> from <hi>Judah,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both, 1. In that his speech was directed unto <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and that <hi>Israel</hi> are the persons spoken of; Neither, 2. Was it true that <hi>Judah had been for a long time without God,</hi> &amp;c. but the contrary. And, 3. The ten Tribes were after their separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Judah</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> termed <hi>Israel;</hi> as also, 4. He tells them that <hi>Judah</hi> had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a clean contrary dispensation to this; <hi>The Lord</hi> (says he) <hi>is with you,</hi> v. 2. and will be <hi>whilst you are with him:</hi> And so indeed he had been from that first separation and rent made by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> from them until now. And that speech also you may put either in the time past, <hi>He hath been with you,</hi> or in time to come, <hi>He will be with you;</hi> the Original hath left it free for either, or for both, in saying only; <hi>The Lord with you,</hi> only the following words do carry it to the time to come.</p>
                  <p>These were the Circumstances of this Juncture of time, and after all these things thus related and urged by this prophet, thereupon that followed immediatly in the story, which also had followed as the consequent (at least) of this his exhortation; which surely was divulged by <hi>Asa</hi> in his gathering them together, <hi>verse</hi> 9. <hi>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh, and out of Simeon, for they sell to him out of Israel in abundance when they saw that the Lord his God was with him.</hi> So as this second <hi>Ebullition</hi> and inundation of these three Tribes in such abundance was effected in the view and intuition of all those things that have been mentioned; yea and also in the vertue and strength of them it was that <hi>Asa</hi> did gather such numbers, which must have been by sending unto all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> and these Tribes, inviting them to come in and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God at <hi>Pentecost</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem (verse</hi> 10.) and to enter into a Covenant so to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if we look round about the Coast and face of these times and view the posture of affairs it will not be much material to enquire whether all these of the three Tribes or others of the ten that could remove had quitted their own possessions of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their respective Tribes, and removed to <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to dwell therein.</p>
                  <p>It is most likely that many of these persons were necessitated to abandon their present possessions by reason that the people of their respective Cities that continued still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King of <hi>Israel</hi>'s dominion, would see to it, that those who went out from them should no more return to possess what they had amongst them, especially seeing those that went are said to fall in to the King of <hi>Judah</hi> as unto their Prince, and not only to have come to him for the present, yea and to have entred into an Oath and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to continue to worship God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> v. 12, 13, 14.</p>
                  <p>It must still be withal remembred and carried along with us, that these three Tribes were near borderers upon <hi>Judah;</hi> and so although they had been inhabitants in some of the Cities and Towns under the King of <hi>Israel</hi>'s Dominion, yet, being borderers, they had a fairer and shorter passage to slip into <hi>Judah,</hi> or any of the Cities in these Tribes in the possession of <hi>Judah.</hi> 'Twas but a day, or a day and a half's Journey. Yea and that a passage was at this time somewhat open for them so to do, may be argued from this, that <hi>Baasha</hi> the present King of <hi>Israel</hi> afterwards upon this very occasion did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to build <hi>Ramah</hi> to obstruct this passage (as the 1. <hi>verse</hi> of the next Chapter hath it) which passage for these Tribes therefore afore (and so at this time) lay more free for them to pass.</p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:154381:184"/>
                  <p> But this was not the present condition of the Godly, their Brethren in the other ten Tribes, who were distant many days Journeys, and who if they would remove must adventure far greater personal dangers of being taken and intercepted. Would not (think we) those hundred Prophets, whom <hi>Obadiah</hi> hid in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Reign, have much rather run away unto <hi>Judah,</hi> unto the good King <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> then Reigning there, than to have lain hid in a Cave and live barely on bread and water, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 4. As the times were harder so the distance made the difficulty to have escaped far greater. These in the heart of those Dominions, or utmost parts thereof, were more strictly watcht and encompassed and hedged in, and utterly dis-enabled to remove whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                  <p>And the Consideration of this difference between these three Tribes and those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doth afford a great light unto the Case in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> What hazards we are to venture and what not.</p>
                  <p>But that which I urge and insist on in the case of those three Tribes (that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and had opportunity without such dangers to do it) as to the solving any seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Objection that may arise therefrom, is; That, supposing the loss of their Estates at home (for that we will suppose) yet such a removal was simply and absolutely in it self best for them, and the best choice that possibly could be made by men considering all those Circumstances fore-mentioned, and they needed not to have much debate, or hesitance what to do.</p>
                  <p>The experience of so many former miseries which they and their Country-men had run through like one wave treading on the neck of another; the fore telling that the same, or worse, would continue for a long season (as indeed they did) and then the certain prophecies of a final Captivity at last to dispossess them of all and remove them to Heathenish Countries, which continueth even unto these our days were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations sufficient to make them change their abode, when they saw such changes of Princes, Usurpers over them made and like to be made, as the curse of their revolt from the house of <hi>David,</hi> when they saw so unstable a government, unhinged, and like a reed in the water tossed this way and that upon every alteration, so as they must needs make account to hold nothing that was their own in any certain way, but to tire out a dying life in fears and expectations of they knew not what calamities, nor how soon to come upon them, and when in the mean time they knew this to be certain, that the oppression of their Consciences in matters of Religion would continue as long as the Nation.</p>
                  <p>These thoughts were enough to make them weary of their dwelling, and it was best for these men in this case to quit all, and come into a settled stable Government, secured by a succession of Kings of the seed of <hi>David</hi> to which the promises were made for after times, whom God afore their own eyes had prospered hitherto unto wonderment, and to whom the promise was, that he would continue still to do great things for them. It was best for these men to remove into a place where a defence was upon all the glory. Yea, and they had this farther encouragement, that they had seen two such Kings farther and son, one after the other, so truly godly and Zealous of God's true worship, and lovers of their Brethren, the godly <hi>Israelites,</hi> whereof the letter now Reigning was holy to an Eminency; and farther they were encourag'd to cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the brotherly aid and assistance of their Brethren of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> &amp;c. and upon the bounty of so holy and large hearted a Prince as this <hi>Asa</hi> was, and who, through the blessing of God was newly enriched with so great spoils (unto a consecrated part of which they came to joyn in the Sacrifice, <hi>v.</hi> 10.) and so was abundantly ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to provide for them out of this abundance that fell to him, besides the other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ways of doing it; who also had lately won Cities to put them into (if need were) especially considering that this King and this people had invited them to come and gathered them together upon the Sermon of a Prophet sent from God to that end to worship God and proposed unto them to joyn in a solemn Oath and Covenant afore God mutually, and also unto God so to do. For, by their access the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> would be (as it was) greatly strengthened and grow in reputation and honour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, yea, and finally God had by that last Prophet promised this King and those of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, that their work should be rewarded,</hi> v. 7. and to unite and gather together, and so to support these strangers, their persecuted brethren in their sufferings, or to help any others who had afore voluntarily come into them, was one and a great part of that work the promise was made unto, that it should be rewarded. Now upon all these
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:154381:185"/> grounds. These persons had reason to judge that this King and this people were in the highest measure engaged and obliged hereunto. Since therefore they were in these Circumstances, and were rationally possesst with these and such like apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it was most eligible for them to leave their dwellings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Though indeed in it self it was an hard and difficult tryal, yet when they were so necessitated on the one hand and their way on the other side was so promising and sweet'ned, and on both hands rendred the only way to secure and preserve themselves and their posterity, an appeal might be made unto all men to judge if these alone were not simply motives sufficient to render it every way most eligible, yea and to make them so to rejoyce in the good providence of God that had so wisely and so graciously contrived such a juncture and opportunity and season of advantage for them. And indeed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval is put upon this very thing as part of the season of it in the text, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>They fell to him (viz.</hi> Asa) <hi>in abundance when they saw that the Lord his God was with him,</hi> so wonderfully with him as hath been related, so as the outward prosperous condition of him moved them.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> hath shewen himself as deep-sighted, and apprehensive to spy out of the Stories and imperfect Narrations of Times, what the face or Scheme of things in any age was, as any Historian whatever that hath undertaken to set forth matters of that Nature. And he gives this Judgment of that juncture of time during <hi>Asa</hi>'s Reign and puts not only this Remark upon it, that it was the <hi>eminent sole time of advantage</hi> (for he could find no such other during the whole 250 years) for the whole people of <hi>Israel</hi> to have t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ken the opportunity to have set themselves free from that Idolatry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to have united themselves to this <hi>Asa</hi> King of <hi>Judah</hi> their natural Prince, and the people of <hi>Judah</hi> their Brethren; and he spends two whole sections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the debate thereof, and that chiefly upon politique and prudent considerations. He begins his fifth Section thus, <hi>In the Reign of Asa the Kingdom of Israel felt great and violent Commotions which might have reduced the ten Tribes unto their former alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance unto the house of David if the wisdom of God had not otherwise determined.</hi> And the sixth Section begins thus: <hi>Any man that shall consider the state of Israel in those times may justly wonder how it came to pass either that the whole nation wearyed with the Calamities already suffered under these unfortunate Princes</hi> (from <hi>Jeroboam</hi> until now) <hi>did not return to their ancient Kings and re-unite themselves with the mighty Tribes of Judah and Benjamin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore give me leave, not to wonder, if, at such a season, multitudes of particular godly persons of those three bordering tribes, Zealous of the true Religion did thus choose to break from that Yoke for a time, when withal, this course was presented unto them to be the only probable way of safety, and so invited them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and the opportunity lay so fairly open for it, especially when the enjoyment of the Ordinances of God was connext with it, and cast into the bargain to their present security.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There was a third going up of these Tribes in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s time but five years afore the final ruine of that people as a Nation; which was occasioned and drawn in by an invitation of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> (as that of <hi>Asa</hi>'s had also been) upon which it is said that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of <hi>Asher, and Manasses, and Zebulon humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem,</hi> 2 Chron. 30. 11. when the generality of that people laughed at the message and mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p>But then, withal, let the case and condition of this people at that juncture of time be considered also, and it will be found, the people then had a far greater freedom than any formerly had.</p>
                  <p>Their Condition at that time, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. (not to insist on that which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned in the case of that second removal) was this, that there were many Cities of the ten Tribes that had continued all along subject to the Kings of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from <hi>Abijah</hi>'s, and <hi>Asa</hi>'s days even to <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s, whom <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could command as well as invite to come; Read for this, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13: 10. and <hi>ch:</hi> 15. 8. Yea, and it would seem that the Cities of <hi>Manasseh</hi> and others of <hi>Ephraim</hi> had upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and Miseries that had fallen out in <hi>Israel</hi> given up themselves unto <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> or formerly unto some of the Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi> For 'tis evident <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had dominion therein what is said (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 1.) that after that passover the people went and brake down the Images in all <hi>Judah,</hi> in <hi>Ephraim</hi> also, and <hi>Manasseh,</hi> which being
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:154381:185"/> done by <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Subjects and with his authority, these Cities also must have been under his dominion.</p>
                  <p>But that which I principally consider and urge in the case, and which will carry all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it and defend it from objections is this, That God, in his gracious providence had so disposed of this nick and juncture of time that all of the ten Tribes that would, had liberty to go to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship by the permission of their King who was over them; which was a mercy and priveledge never afore vouchsafed for almost two hundred and fifty years. <hi>Hosea</hi> was then their King (and the last King of their own over them) when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> sent this invitation to the ten Tribes, and the power of their Kings had been afore (as appears by 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 19. and <hi>v.</hi> 29.) and was (as it remained in this Kings time) much broken; insomuch that the first nine years of the time from the vacancy of the former King whereinto this <hi>Hosea</hi> succeeded is reckoned by interpreters as a time of confusion and anarchy of the people, after those nine years when he is reckoned to have become a settled King, it was by his having been made but as a Tributary unto <hi>Salmaneser</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> (as in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 3. expresly tells us) and who, as many think had set him up King, and by reason of this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, on a foreign Prince, his interest was changed from that of those former Kings who had prohibited the going of People to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> out of a fear which they had of their making a party among them for the Kings of <hi>Judah;</hi> and hence, as for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which the Circumstances, wherein he was, led him unto, he, of all the other Kings, gave this liberty unto the people to worship as they pleased, and this that passage (which the Holy Ghost, as on purpose, hath inserted) 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. 2. seems to signifie and point to us, <hi>And he did that that was evil in the sight of the Lord, but not as the Kings of Israel that were before him:</hi> Those latter words, <hi>but not as the Kings of Israel that were before him</hi> do <hi>notanter, remarkably,</hi> give a different character of this King from all the foregoing Kings and that in respect of that sin which had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and universal to them all afore, and not of some particular personal sins only. Now what had that been but that sin which is noted all along to have been <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s sin first, who was the Father of that abomination, and who led the round to all that succeeded, and which sin is heedfully all along from <hi>Jeroboam</hi> downward affixed to them all that they made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had in worshipping the Calves at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and who withal severely prohibited any of their Subjects to go up unto <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to worship; for that was the main intent that the Calves were set up for. This was general to them all whereas <hi>Heathenish</hi> Idolatry (which some would have to be the difference) was but the sin of some of them.</p>
                  <p>Many Interpreters, from hence, do plainly collect and, <hi>in terminis,</hi> in express Terms, affirm, that this <hi>Hoshea</hi> did give liberty to this people, his subjects, to go up to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to offer there. The true reason whereof was, that the proper interest of those former Kings was broken, and he holding of a foreign Prince, strong enough to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, scrupled not to quit this so long continued a Law, <hi>viz.</hi> that prohibition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout going to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and thus Jewish writers themselves have understood it: Say they, though <hi>Hoshea</hi> himself did worship the Calves, yet permitted he his subjects that would, to go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to worship in the Temple, which the rest of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> had not permitted, nay did use to set Watch-men and Gaurds at all ways whereby their people should go to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to stop and hinder them from going to worship.</p>
                  <p>And there is this further evidence for that in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 6. where that serious and solemn invitation of <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s is made by Letters and Posts unto the Cities of the ten Tribes in these words, <hi>So the Posts went with the letters from the King and his Princes throughout all</hi> Israel <hi>and</hi> Judah, <hi>and according to the commandment of the King, saying, Ye Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>turn again unto the Lord God of</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the Kings of</hi> Assyria. Where you see the King is twice mentioned, and the first mention doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently refer unto <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and his Princes, who were the writers, and senders of the Letters together with the Posts, and who were at the charge of it; but the second mention in these words, <hi>And according to the Commandment of the King,</hi> do refer (says <hi>Deodati)</hi> unto the Command or permission of the King of <hi>Assyria</hi> himself to them who was the supream over them, and had assented to give them liberty. But I should say, those words refer rather unto this <hi>Hoshea</hi> himself, who though a Tributary King, under the <hi>Assyrian;</hi> was yet left to rule them as to their Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as he should order, or
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:154381:186"/> else suppose him a King made by the people, and independent on any other, yet still so it fell out, that to gratifie all sorts among the people he had given allowance by an edict that they who would, should go up to worship,; and so it was according to their own King's Commandment, that this was done as well as by <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s invitation and Letters. And truly it cannot be rationally thought that the Letters as written in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>'s name should run in the style of a Commandment from him, as sent unto the ten Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> (whom what follows there doth particularly concern) for they were no way under his Command or Jurisdiction, but subjects of another King; and therefore I take the whole of it up thus, That <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> the King of <hi>Judah,</hi> indeed wrote and sent the Letters, the contents whereof are specified, <hi>saying, Ye children of</hi> Israel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet withal there had been an edict of granting freedom by their own King promulged, which is termed his Command, and whereas that word <hi>saying,</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following the word <hi>Commandment,</hi> seems according to our Translation to carry the contents that follow, as if commanded by that King, we must know that in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> this word, being in the place of a <hi>gerund,</hi> may and doth refer to the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Hezekiah</hi> sent, and shews what they contained, and not unto the Command; for, indeed, these words, <hi>according to the command of the King,</hi> are best read by way of Parenthesis, as signifying a coincident matter with the Letters, as if he had said, that these things were done by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> not against, but with an edict of their own King himself concurring, and declaring for leave to his people, which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, if this <hi>Hoshea</hi> their own King had not thus far afore-hand someway declared this, it may well be thought that the entertainment of them that went with the Letters into his Dominion would not have been a mockage in word by the common people, but would have ended in blows rather, or in their having been intecepted at least, seeing the people were so highly and generally spirited against them for their Message (which their mocking shewed) and for their coming into their Kingdom under the Jurisdiction of another King, and that boldly to invite them unto what in former times had been accounted Treason and Rebellion. Certainly, unless King <hi>Hoshea</hi> had some way promulged and made publickly known so much as might quiet and hold the hands of this people off from violence unto these single persons the Messengers, they would have fallen upon them: But in that they only mocked and went not about so much as to excuse themselves for their refusal, which excuse had been easie and ready, if so be, they had been under the old wonted restraint in this King's days, which had been in force, all this put together would argue that they were indeed really at a liberty to have taken <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s invitation if they had pleased, but that out of their own innate prophanness of heart they contemned it (having been for a long time disused thereto) which frame of heart (where it was let thus free to their arbitr'ment) God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to fore-run and make way for the filling up their own and their fore-fathers ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in this particular sin, and for justifying that fatal final Captivity that followed upon the whole Nation specially, and to this purpose further the Lord guided <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his Letters to write in this manner to them, verse 7, 8, 9. <hi>And be not ye like your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and like your Brethren which trespassed against the Lord God of their Fathers who therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see. Now be ye not stiff-necked as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were, but yield your selves unto the Lord, and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever; and serve the Lord your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you. For if ye turn again unto the Lord, your Brethren and your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren shall find compassion before them that lead them Captive, so that they shall come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into this Land: for the Lord your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him:</hi> Wherein he prompted to them, that their Captivity threatned might hereby be prevented, and not only so but that their Brethren that had already been led Captive might yet come to have that compassion from the Kings of <hi>Assyria,</hi> who had led many of them away, and that God would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their hearts so, as even they also should come again into their own land; so good and gracious is our God as for the repentance of some part of a Nation to be moved to shew mercy unto others of that Nation thereupon; which is a very great instance to encourage the people of God in a Nation to turn to him and seek to him for themselves and their Brethren.</p>
                  <p>One thing by the way I must here note, That whereas of these present inhabitants (to whom those Letters were sent) 'tis said, v. 6. <hi>They were a remnant that had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped</hi>
                     <pb n="369" facs="tcp:154381:186"/>
                     <hi>out of the hand of the King of Assyria,</hi> this passage is not to be understood as if the present King of <hi>Assyria</hi> had not been at this time supreme over them and they and their King <hi>Hoshea</hi> Tributary unto him, as was noted; but it is only to be understood that by God's goodness this small remnant had escaped from being carried Captives as the rest had been by <hi>Pul,</hi> and <hi>Tilgath-Pilneser,</hi> 1 Chron. 5. 26. 2 Kings 15. 29. and that these words <hi>(v.</hi> 26.) are spoken in relation unto Captivity, the comparing of <hi>v.</hi> 8. and <hi>v.</hi> 9. shews.</p>
                  <p>There is one appearance more of an argument that they had such a freedom gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by their King <hi>Hoshea</hi> in that the Passover having been ended (2 Chr. 31. 1.) <hi>All Israel that was present brake down the images,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and after all was done, Then all the Children of Israel returned every man to his own posession into their own Cities.</hi> This being so indigitatively said <hi>[All the Children of</hi> Israel] carries this with it, that those of the ten Tribes that had come out of all <hi>Israel,</hi> returned every man to his own City from whence he had come, and where his own possession lay, which (if they had not liberty from their King <hi>Hoshea</hi> to have come up, such as in former times had not been granted) they could not peaceably have presumed to have done or to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain enjoyed their possessions, which also that passage in Chron. 30. 25. confirms <hi>And all the Congregation of Judah with the Priests and Levites and all the Congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the Land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoyced.</hi> Where we see, that, <hi>The Congregation, who came out of Israel,</hi> are distinguished from <hi>the strangers that formerly came out of the Land of Israel, and then dwelt in Jerusalem:</hi> So as the most of that Congregation that had at that present come, returned to their own homes. And yet I cannot but think that God did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade and guide many of their hearts, either at that passover or some of the next (that for five years followed) to stay at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and so they escaped that lamentable Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, which, after those years ended, fell upon those fore-mentioned mockers in that Nation.</p>
                  <p>You have seen how many instances the old Testament holds out either for forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or a prudent management of injoying Ordinances, or avoiding the Case of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> There's no Objection of moment in the Old Testament to the contrary, that I know of, but that of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 6. v. 7, 10. <hi>Where all the presidents of the Kingdom, the Governors and the Princes, the Councellors and the Captains having consulted together to establish a royal Statute and to make a firm Decree, That whosoever shall ask a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any God or Man, for thirty days, save of the King, he shall be cast into the den of Lions. Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house, and his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows being open in his Chamber towards Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God, as he did afore time.</hi> And this indeed is a great Objection; in appearance, for he neither forebore altogether the practice of the duty, nor used any avoidance, or so much as a concealment. For if he would have pray'd he might have prayed secretly and performed the inward worship of prayer which God regards, or he might have performed the outward <hi>privately,</hi> as <hi>for time,</hi> he might have done it in the night; as <hi>for place,</hi> he might have done it in another place, in a privater room; he needed not to have opened his windows; but yet we see that he chooseth to use an open and an avowed profession, says the 10th. <hi>v. Now when Daniel knew that the writing was sign'd,</hi> that is, knew full well the nature of the Decree, that it was irreversible, knew his Enemies manner of getting it and their design in it, knew full well the danger that he should incur, <hi>viz.</hi> that the instant after he should have done it death must follow; for he knew the King, though he favoured him, could not pardon him; yet, he never so much as deliberates at all whether he should or he should not, but went immediately into his house and down upon his knees with his window open, and as some read it, did <hi>every way</hi> do as he had wont.</p>
                  <p>The argument from hence is this, that when the supreme Magistrate forbids any part of worship of God publick or private, every Christian is bound after <hi>Daniel</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to continue to practise it with boldness, openness, yea, in all Circumstances as he had wont; there being the like reason of all worship else as there is of prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. This is perfectly contradictory to all the former instances. And in a special manner unto that last, Ezra. 4. 23, 24. <hi>They made them cease by force and power, then ceast the work of building the Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:154381:187"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. That this example of <hi>Daniel</hi> should extend unto all duties of Religious worship when prohibited by the Magistrate, whatever the case be, cannot be. For neither were all these former instances sinfully acted, nor was <hi>Daniel</hi> the only valiant man in the old Testament, whose example should reprove all the rest. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (as our Saviour Christ says) cannot be broken, and therefore of necessity there must be found out a reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>And those that are of that opinion of an absolute obligation in case of such prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in any part of publick worship, without any relaxation, ought not to run away with one part (as yet men use to do) but are obliged soberly to seek to reconcile these things as well as we of this other oppinion, and to do otherwise is a great contempt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Scripture; and this Reconciliation is no way done but by finding out the clear ground of the difference from the nature of the duties and the cases. Our Non-conformists in the case of the Oath <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> in which a man was put upon it to accuse himself in matter of fact, had Christ's instance was urged upon them, <hi>that Caiaphas</hi> the High Priest <hi>by</hi> an Oath did adjure him, <hi>I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou be Christ the Son of God, Jesus said unto him, thou hast said;</hi> And it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from thence that therefore every man was bound to answer by Oath unto what he should by the Ecclesiastical power be put upon. The Non-consequence of this did easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear from a contrary practice of our Lord, as that when false witnesses came and said in the words afore, <hi>This man said I am able to destroy the Temple of God and to build it in three days</hi> (which yet in the substance of it was what he himself had, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, spoken in relation to the Temple of his Body, yet unto this <hi>he answers nothing.</hi> Was it that he had an oath put upon him in the one case, which put the difference? No, he might have chosen whether he would have accepted of that Oath or no; yet, he thought himself bound to answer to the one, but not to the other.</p>
                  <p>There was therefore in this case this ground of difference suggested by those good men, between the one case and the other, that the subject matter whereabout he was askt was differing. The one was <hi>matter of fact,</hi> but the other was <hi>matter of confession.</hi> A point of absolute necessity to declare himself the Son of God, which was necessary at that time, or else for ever his Testimony ceased. For his Enemies were resolved to put him to death, it was necessary, especially for the matter of it, it being that great point both of his concernment, and our faith, <hi>That he was the Son of God.</hi> And the difference of these two doth give a rational ground why he answered to the one and not to the other. The like may be observed when they askt him Concerning his Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, he refuses to answer <hi>(John</hi> 18. 20.) because it was <hi>matter of fact</hi> in what he had preached, of which afterward.</p>
                  <p>Things that are thus like in all appearance have yet in the foundation of them a vast difference, and so will this Case of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s be found to have from the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There have been some who have denyed that it was well done of him, but that he was simple and foolish in it, and needlesly exposed himself to Death; for he might have prayed, say they, 1. Inwardly, and so have performed his Duty, At least, 2. If he would pray with bodily worship, he might have done it privately, or at night, and in another place.</p>
                  <p>But this opinion is confuted not only because the Holy Ghost hath recorded this great act of his, and also that it is witnessed unto, by so great a deliverance from God, which shewed God's acceptance of it, and also that <hi>Darius,</hi> a <hi>Heathen,</hi> did witness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s integrity in those words, <hi>Thy God whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee</hi> (v. 16.) But also because <hi>Daniel</hi> himself <hi>(verse</hi> 22.) puts it upon this reason, <hi>For as much as before God innocency was found in me,</hi> and <hi>(v.</hi> 23.) <hi>No manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Others say it was an <hi>Heroick</hi> extraordinary act that is not to be drawn into Ordinary Example. But we have no Warrant to think so, and I shall not have recourse to extraordinaries whereby to difference it from the former Instances.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It yet must be acknowledged to be a special act in a special case, whereof per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps such another instance is not, in all points, to be again found in the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I will tell you what the good old Non-conformists principles were in this case. Their practice is known, that when they were silenced from preaching by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, or Bishops, they forbare preaching all their days, and afterwards when the way of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:154381:187"/> going to <hi>New-England</hi> had been started, some that were but in danger of the High Commission removed unto <hi>New-England,</hi> and so avoided the storm (as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> did, leaving the bulk of his Church here) and when this Instance of <hi>Daniel</hi> was urged Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> gave this account of it.</p>
                  <p>He used to produce that example of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s ceasing the building of the Temple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd by force, for justification of the <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> forbearance, and suffering themselves to be silenced and then being silent: so, in answer to this place of <hi>Daniel</hi> and reconciliation of both, and for the clearing of either, he put this substantial differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the one and the orher, That <hi>Daniel</hi>'s case came under an immediate duty of the first Commandment, which was personal prayer unto God, as also under a duty of Confession to be made of the true God, in which case there is no room for mercy or preservation of a man's self; but he is called to lay down his life in that case. But that other Instance in <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the like, was the forbearance of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward instituted worship, and such an one Temple-worship was, Sacrifice, and the like, parallel to our Ordinances of preaching by Ministers, and to our Churches, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that of thesc latter with difference from the other Christ's rule holds true, <hi>I will have mercy rather than Sacrifice</hi> (which was the Temple-worship) <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> being the highest Instances of instituted worship.</p>
                  <p>I shall enlarge this Notion and prosecute it farther.</p>
                  <p>I shall, 1. Consider the Nature of this fact of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s, in the Substance of it. And, 2. Insist on the differences of other cases.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I shall remove Objections that may be made from his retaining of outward Circumstances, kneeling openly and toward <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as he had wont every day to do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The substance of the act is a Complex of many things which, when stated, and first considered apart and then put again together, will aford a clear difference from the Case of other outward Ordinances. <hi>Calvin</hi> insists on two things, as I observe out of his Comment, as Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> also hath done.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Object of the prohibition was, that none should pray to God for a Month together; and then he further adds that it came under the nature of the Case of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of God. Now I will not lay all the stress of the whole weight upon each of these apart singly (though each would bear a rational ground of difference from the former instances) but on the whole Complexion of all together.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Object of the Edict was, that none should pray at all unto God; for it runs thus, <hi>To establish a Royal Statute and to make a firm Decree, that whosoever shall ask a Petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of the thee, O King, he shall be cast into the den of Lions.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Cum in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doratione et cultu dei primas par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes obtineat precatio—ne quisquam oraret erat manifesta et crassa nimis abnegatio pietatis—</hi>and again that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>praecipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium—</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Calvin</hi> first makes a great matter of this that prayer should be thus forbidden, because that in the worship of God Prayer is the top and the chief worship, and the highest Sacrifice of all other; and it is at large urged by him that it is that we own simply to God in all conditions; a duty whereby we are to witness God to be the Author of all good to us, to acknowledge our dependance upon him for all benefits, either to come which we obtain by Prayer, or past and present; and therefore, in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s practice here <hi>(v.</hi> 10.) as he prayed so he gave thanks before his God. It is by prayer that we offer up our Desires and Vows unto God and cast all our cares upon him, which if we forbear we shew we can be without God, without His help, His aid; whereas if he withdraw, we perish every moment; and this we are to do every day. Now, to make a Decree that whatsoever a man's distress be, if he be sick he must not pray, if under lusts, if he were near unto death (as a man might think) he must not pray or call upon God for a moment together, would be to make an edict against all Religion: <note n="†" place="margin">Hence, says <hi>Calvin, Cum Rex vetaret us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum mensem ullam precationem concipere, hoc erat exigere a singulis ut Deum abnegarent. Edictum Darij pugnat cum jure naturae. Quod enim quem{que} docet et convincet esse Deum ac proinde colendum Polanus.</hi> Again he says, <hi>Infringeret</hi> Daniel <hi>jus omnibus Hominibus innatum.</hi> Also, <hi>Willet</hi> on Daniel, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>quaest.</hi> 16.</note> And others also urge it unto such a purpose as this; we further put it, it was against Nature, the Law of Nature (as the <hi>Dutch Annotations</hi> say) For, the <hi>Heathen Marriners</hi> in <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Ship, when in danger of death, called every man upon his God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence then, there is this difference between <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Case and that of Instituted worship; That, in this case of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Prayer in the general Universal Nature of it was prohibited, not Family-Worship or Assembly-Worship, but all; and Prayer thus
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:154381:188"/> taken is immediately Natural, and needed no super-added Institution, but it is Essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Worship, it is <hi>Cultus Essentialis,</hi> and not <hi>Medium Cultùs,</hi> as to pray in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and the like, are, and so it doth differ wholly from Instituted prayers in a Church, &amp; as put up by one man as the Mouth of the rest; such were Temple-Sacrifices, Synagogue-Prayers and Preaching, which are parallel to ours.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Add unto this that it was not only Commanded that thus prayer, in the general nature of it, and then simply considered should be forborn (though that had been an horrible impiety against the immediate Law of Nature, the highest Law of Nature that is for the worship of God) but further, this Act of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s, in the Circumstances he stood in, rose up to be a Confession and Profession of the true God as God, which he must have renounced if he had forborn; and <hi>Calvin</hi> makes that a second ground of this act of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>To explain this head, I shall distinguish thus: Confession is taken indeed;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Largely for the manifestation or holding out of any particular practice or duty, point or truth of Religion, of any or every Command of God whatsoever; for in holding forth of these, their is a profession (as we call it) runs alongs with all these. Now there is no man will say, that a man is bound to hold forth every truth he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, although he is prohibited to speak it; <hi>Hast thou faith?</hi> (says the Apostle) <hi>have it for thy self;</hi> which is also the thing that <hi>Calvin</hi> asserts, that as there are many truths which a man may forbear to speak, as not being bound to do so, so many practices in which it is meet to forbear; and yet in all these there is a profession runs along; for in these Cases their not professing is not a denying such a truth or practice, but a concealing it, and forbearing to hold it forth at such and such a time, which at other times and in other cases we would do and were bound to do. <hi>Therefore the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent shall keep silence in that time, for it is an evil time,</hi> Amos 5. 13. And this holding forth of duties or truths or practices in this general nature is rather profession than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; And here there must be found a right joint or rational ground of difference, to Judge what we be bound to profess and what not, and at what Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is Confession strictly and properly taken: which is not at large a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion only, but an absolute Confession of God, wherein we must deny God, if we don't affirm him, if we conceal our selves, and our Faith. And Confession so taken is a transcendent thing, and comes up into the first Commandment, and is all one as to avouch God to be a man's God, and to love God or to fear him.</p>
                  <p>This called in Scripture <hi>Confession,</hi> with this additament, and a <hi>not-denying</hi> of him, <hi>John</hi> 1. 10. when the <hi>Jews</hi> sent Priests and Levites from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to ask <hi>John</hi> the Baptist, who art thou? as supposing he might be the Christ, it is said, <hi>He confessed and denied not, but confest, I am not the Christ;</hi> and (says he, <hi>v.</hi> 27.) <hi>He it is, who coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me, is preferred afore me,</hi> whom afterwards he pointed unto.</p>
                  <p>This must not be extended to every forbearance of a truth, or of an Ordinance, though prohibited by a Magistrate's Command. When therefore the point of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Confession is urged, as absolutely necessary, the Question still must be, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration must be had, of the Nature of the duty, and of the truth, which, in such and such cases to forbear or conceal, would be truly and plainly and really a declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>It is not barely, and hand over head that every man is bound, by the Law of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, presently to perform any or every practice, or any or every truth that the Magistrate shall interdict for the present; for concerning things of such a degree there may be some other Rule from God, who may warrant me to the contrary, as that which hath been instanced in of mercy and not sacrifice. Our Saviour Christ would
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:154381:188"/> not tell the <hi>Jews</hi> by what Authority he did these things; but he made a positive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer when he came and was put to it whether he was the Son of God, or no, by <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High-Priest (and as it is said) by all the Assembly, Luke 22. 70. <hi>Art thou then the Son of God? and he said unto him, Ye say that I am; and they said, What need we any further witnesses? for we our selves have heard it out of his own Mouth.</hi> When they askt him of his Doctrine, as preacht by him, he would not directly answer, John 18. 19, 20, 21. <hi>The High-Priest asked Jesus of his Disciples, and of his Doctrine, Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the World, I ever taught in the Synagogues, and Temple, whither the Jews resort, and in secret have</hi> I <hi>said nothing: Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I said unto them; behold they know what I said.</hi> If any honest godly preacher were Questioned, by an Adversary that had power, what he had preacht at such a time and should refuse to give in a Coppy of his Sermon, and the like, they would be apt to cry out upon him, and upon others also perhaps, who are godly, <hi>Are you ashamed of what you have preacht? do you go from your Doctrine? which if you don't confess openly, or forbear to tell it, you do,</hi> would they say. Yet, but take it as it had been preacht and then it is matter of fact, and he is not bound to confess it. Our Saviour Christ's example warrants it, referring them unto witnesses; but when they askt our Saviour Christ, whether he was the Son of God, or no? and what his Faith and Conscience in that point was, he answers roundly, and without hesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, though he knew his life lay upon it; and this is that good Confession which he witnessed that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of to <hi>Timothy</hi> (1 Tim. 6. 13.) which, whether it include not also that Confession of his to <hi>Pilate</hi> himself, That he was a King, and that for this end he came into the world, may be a Question, for the words will bear either sense, that he witnessed before <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> or under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the Point of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s act of his praying in these Circumstances and in this manner, and to consider it, as it was a point of the highest sort of Confession strictly and properly taken, so that if he had not so confest, he must have denyed God, and if he had forborn, he must have renounced Religion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Command (as was said) was to suspend all prayer to any God for a whole month's space, which was to bring in total Atheism for so long a time, and to take away all worship that <hi>Daniel</hi> had left him, or was capable of performing. For there is no Worship can be performed without invocation of God. Prayer was by their <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdoche</hi> signally all worship; yea and it was so according to their own principles that procured this Law; for themselves worshipt some God or other, which they did under the common notion and acknowledgement of a Deity and a God-head, and therefore to suspend prayer to him for that time was to make a Law that there should be no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of God in the World during that time, according to their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and therefore I see most interpreters do state it upon the whole of Religion, that forbearance of prayer would have been the abnegation of it, and therefore <hi>Daniel,</hi> by such a Total and visible forbearance (having been accustomed to such a Confession) must thereby have given by a visible withdrawing and concealment a visible profession there was no God extant to be worshipt. And his opening of the Window toward <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in this case, became a visible profession that the God that he Worshipt was the God that dwelt at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and had seated himself there between the Cherubims formerly, and kept the same place still.</p>
                  <p>And 2. In this Decree not only God and all his worship is taken away, but a King, and a mortal Man was set directly up in the room of God and unto the denyal of this God, for so the Decree runs, not to ask a Petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of the King.</p>
                  <p>This King was exalted above all that was called God, the true God and all God's else (in oppinion such) by this injunction to pray to none other God but unto him. For this was to ordain that during that time he should have all the respect and homage and reverence to be brought in to him instead of worship to God; and so though such Petitions put up to the King in the mean time, were but in Civil things for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, and such usually, were presented at other times, and so the Petitioning was in it self but a Civil act, as petitioning to a King is; yet in this case That all petitions to any God or Man must be forborn and none put up but unto the King, this was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatively a Worship of that Man because he was addressed unto, in lieu and stead of all addresses, or worshipping of God, and because it was to be to him with exclusion
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:154381:189"/> of God as thereby acknowledging no other God but him all that while. In this case therefore further, for <hi>Daniel</hi> to have concealed himself, invisibly worshipping the true God, had been a Manifest Denyal of God, and in a visible manner.</p>
                  <p>These Corollaries may be drawn from the former Examples.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may admire the good and gracious providence of God, that in the times wherein his wrath was so high and great upon the generality of the ten Tribes du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 254 years, and in the times of such great distresses as these were upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences; he should yet work out a liberty for any of them through a special providence at such several seasons. Yea, and the advantage which God did cast into the second, as also the third season of liberty, upon their removals, for the Ordinances, is very remarkable in the Event and success thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the Second Company that removed in <hi>Asa</hi>'s time; They first came to live under the prosperous Reign of <hi>Asa,</hi> who reigned after this their falling in to him many years, and <hi>Jehoshophat</hi> his Son, a godly man, succeeded him and reigned many years; so as these, in the Event and Success by coming into <hi>Judah,</hi> enjoyed an age of rest and prosperity and a fulness of Ordinances with it.</p>
                  <p>Then, 2. They escaped very great miseries, which the ten Tribes fell into, as <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad</hi>'s invasion and the change of Government, and Governours, <hi>Zimri,</hi> and <hi>Omri,</hi> and <hi>Tibni</hi> (Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> reckons seven of their Kings in <hi>Asa</hi>'s Time) and besides <hi>that</hi> they escaped the Heathenish Tyranny in <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Time, which was the worst time the ten Tribes had.</p>
                  <p>Then for the third Company, who removed in <hi>Hoshea</hi>'s time, if it fell out that they removed their Stations altogether (as some think they did, because of that, 2 Chr. 30. 25. where it is said, <hi>All the Congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the Land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced, so there was great joy in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David, King of Israel, there was not the like in Jerusalem)</hi> or if any of these strangers were of those that came up unto the passover upon <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s invitation, in the former part of the Chapter, and placed their dwellings in <hi>Judah,</hi> then God in his providence did graciously guide them unto a great preservation of themselves and their posterity; for five years after Sennacherib came and carried the generality of the Nation away Captive, and the escape of this Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the good which they got by removing for Ordinances according to <hi>Ahijah</hi>'s prophecy given in <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Time; and beside that these Strangers are twice said to be those that came out of the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> which argues that they were of the ten Tribes.</p>
                  <p>Further, if you compare the Style that is given the former second Company that came out in <hi>Asa</hi>'s Time, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 9.) you will find, that they are said to be the Strangers out of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> so as God owned and highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded this their practice of a removal for the enjoyment of the Ordinances of God in a continuance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. These things were written for our example that we thereby might have light to guide us, and all these instances shew that as for any absolute obligation to instituted Ordinances (that fall back, fall edg, we should be bound to them) that assertion (whoever would maintain it) will come to nothing afore these Examples.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They fall short, and no ways rise up to any such proof; For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All these three Instances shew that those godly <hi>Israelites</hi> came up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> upon opportunites and advantages afforded them in the providence of God, and not simply upon the absolute obligation unto these ordinances. For you read of no more such coming up in the <hi>interims,</hi> but only these three times, which, how they were Circumstantiated, you have seen.</p>
                  <p>And, 2. Thousands of others out of other Tribes, as godly as they, did not remove when these did and yet are blameless, and this because of the difference of the case as hath been explained. I will allude to what <hi>James</hi> says, <hi>Go take ye all,</hi> the Prophets of those Tribes for an ensample (the enumeration of whom that were during those 250. years doth arise to a great number) take also the 7000 that had not bowed to <hi>Baal,</hi> and the 100 prophets hide in the causes; take also <hi>Obadiah</hi> and his case, who is said to <hi>fear the Lord greatly,</hi> who being Governour of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s house, could not be supposed to have removed to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for Ordinances in those times, though no man had more opportunities to get away than he, if he could have removed once for all;
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:154381:189"/> for he had the liberty to go through one part of the Land by <hi>Ahab</hi>'s appointment, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 6. and at other times could by the authority he had at Court, have taken the liberty to have gone out at any time, but being in a great calling of trust to <hi>Ahab,</hi> and doing service to the people of God in hiding so many Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he forbare. And <hi>Elijah</hi> that met him, reproves him not at all for it; yea he hath the commendation of the Holy Ghost himself, that he <hi>feared God greatly.</hi> And for <hi>Eliah</hi> himself, the Lord Commands him expresly to <hi>hide</hi> himself, and names a safe place, 1 <hi>Kings ch.</hi> 17. <hi>verse</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We read not of any in the <hi>Interims</hi> of these three times and seasons that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; which is to be put upon this supposition, that the oppressions of the times hindred them, as it did the former, and that there should be but these three times mentioned only, and a silence in all times else for so many years, argues that they cased in the <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rims</hi> between.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Rule and Measure given at first, <hi>I will have mercy and not sacrifice;</hi> was the ground of all this, and cuts off any alledged absolute obligation; for if they were bound at all times and in all cases, then they were not to forbear at any time for mercy sake, for then there were no room at all for it: The equity of which rule was then extant, as it had been in all ages, and must be to the end of the world; and one of the prophets of these ten Tribes of those times did first utter it, <hi>Hosea</hi> 6. 6. and Jesus Christ applies it unto the breaking of the Sabbath, in case of mercy by plucking the ears of Corn; as also in the case of eating the Shew-Bread, which <hi>David</hi> did, and then of the Priest's toiling, as much as men in any calling do, which Christ calls a prophaning the Sabbath, and yet says that they are blameless, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Nay, the omitting of an Instituted Ordinance, for mercy sake, is far less than the breaking of it, and this is but a forbearance, for Mercy's sake, of which we speak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you will say, that Mercy to our Souls is to be considered, and it is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to our Souls to enjoy Ordinances, and they are to be preferred to all things else.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. I answer, it is true, this will go a great way, and weigh against many difficulties but yet we are to consider this; That mercy to our souls by Ordinances, depends upon our Edification by them, and what that will prove to be, and that edification depends upon God, as he will make them to be profiting; and so now if God comes in between and says, <hi>I will have mercy,</hi> he can make such means as we have (in the want of these other means) edifying to us, when as thus he calls us, to shew mercy to our selves. And he that hath given us this rule, out of his mercy and grace, will be sure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the other part of edifying us when he thus calls us out of the same grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Instituted Ordinances, though they have power of Obligation over us, for <hi>our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,</hi> yet not when it is to apparent destruction, as the Apostles themselves had power for edification, but not for destruction.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is some mercy to be shewed to the Magistrate, that we ought not daringly to meet in so open a way, as we know before-hand will provoke and irritate them to persecute us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Ordinances in the performance of them require quietness and rest, in mens Spirits at least, we cannot pray when we are alone without distraction, much less can we worship God, when we are rationally under certain fears, Deut. 12. 9, 10, 11. <hi>Ye are not yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the Lord your God giveth you: But when ye go over Jordan and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety: Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his Name to dwell there, thither shall you bring all that I command you, your Burnt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and your Sacrifices, your Tithes and the Heave-Offering of your hand, and all your choice Vows which ye vow unto the Lord.</hi> And they forbare many Ordinances in the mean time (as in <hi>verse</hi> 8.) <hi>Ye shall not do after all the things which we do here this day, every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.</hi> The equity of which may be drawn from the Apostles Example. <hi>Paul,</hi> though he had an open door, yet, having no rest in his Spirit, left <hi>Troas.</hi> And it will in a great measure hold, that men should not meet in the midst of fears and terrours, when they are full of fears within and terrours without. It being also a dishonour to the Ordinance when the Assemblies are by force broken up, and the like: Therefore men should so meet both as to time, and place, as it is rationally probable that their present meeting may be in some safety, through
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:154381:190"/> secrecy and privacy. And God did, by his special promise, secure his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Testament, that when they went up to appear before the Lord thrice in the year, <hi>that no man should desire their Land at those times,</hi> (Exod. 34. 24.) which he hath not done to us in the like case.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But you will say, yea, but the glory of God is interested in our use of these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer, That if God will be so gracious to us as to quit that consideration of his own glory for mercy to our selves, as we have cause to be thankful to him for it, so to conform our selves unto this exception which himself hath made.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men yet are to put themselves to much loss, inconvenience, and difficulties to enjoy the Ordinances, as this people of the ten Tribes did.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the best times it was a <hi>weariness</hi> to the people of the ten Tribes, so remote, to go up to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> three times a year; though to the next Tribes it was not much labour: and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> used this as an argument upon the experience which the people had had, as what he thought would move them the more readily to forbear; <hi>'Tis too much for you</hi> (says he) <hi>to go up to Jerusalem,</hi> 1 King. 12. 28. It was an Argument <hi>ad populum,</hi> he spake their hearts, and that which was like to take their hearts, and as what had been a burden to carnal Spirits among them. And truly, do you measure it now, you that have Country-houses, how do you excuse your selves from coming up to Ordinances, and if you had been put to it so much as they were to travel so far, you would grudge at it much more. It was also grievous to suffer great <hi>reproaches, to be made gazing stocks</hi> (which, those that went in the first three years of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> must needs be supposed exposed unto from the generality of the people) and to be accounted next door to Traitors in going unto the Quarters of a Prince, whose yoke they had cast off.</p>
                  <p>But more expresly it is said in that third remove in <hi>Hosea</hi>'s time, that the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and message of invitation by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was mocked at, and laught to scorn by those Tribes sent to, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 30. 10, 11. <hi>The Posts passed from City to City through the Country of Epraim and Manasseth even unto Zebulon; but they laughed them to scorn and mockt them. Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasses and Zebulon humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</hi> Of these it must needs be judged that they were mockt and laught to scorn to purpose as they went out, or went along, and the word <hi>nevertheless</hi> imports that they went Maugre those reproaches, and despised the shame dispisings and scorns.</p>
                  <p>Then, 2. The Priests in that first of <hi>Jeroboams</hi> times removed unto their great loss as to their outward estate, for the revenues and perquisites of the Temple which the Priests lived much upon, were (as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> says) very small. And as for the <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <hi>Sir</hi> W. R. <hi>p.</hi> 452. <hi>The poverty of the Tribes of Levi must needs havé bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great at this time, all their lands and possessions in the ten Tribes being utterly lost, and the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits from those ten Tribes by which they lived being now cut off.</hi>
                     </note> people, those of them that came up and lost their inheritances of Lands, must needs suffer much more loss, as hath been argued, and enjoy a mean livelyhood in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison to what they had in their own Country. Yet we see in what cases they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move for Ordinances, an much therefore is to be allowed of loss of this way to enjoy the means for our Souls, yet so as to look as nature is the foundation of grace and the exercises of it, and if that should fail, the exercises of Religion would fail also, as we see in sickness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so it is here, that there must be a subsistence laid as a foundation for the enjoyment of Ordinances, which, when there is, though it be with much loss and abatement, we are to rejoyce in that as in a great portion, Isa. 30. 20. <hi>The people shall dwell at Zion in Jerusalem.</hi> To dwell in <hi>Zion</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> is to enjoy the Ordinances at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> for <hi>Zion</hi> was the seat of them, and unto such it is said, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Though the Lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet shall not thy Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be removed.</hi> Bread and Cheese and the Gospel was said (in time of Old) to be good fare.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The consideration of the Circumstances these stood in, both those that went up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and those that forbore, may instruct us, and give us light into our duty, and practice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It instructs us, what <hi>proportion</hi> of mercy to our outward condition is to be weigh'd with Ordinances upon which we are to forbear, or not to forbear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It directs us that upon the rational fore-sight of the same or like extremities, we should know how to guide our selves in our adventures to enjoy Ordinances where the like hazards are run, and the like vigilances to hinder them are used, and soberly and conscientiously to consider of every opportunity we adventure to take, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:154381:190"/> secure it is, and not rashly, hand over head, rush upon and adventure upon all or any dangers, come what will.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As for the Case of the removal altogether to enjoy them elsewhere, if it be said that this we ought to do as they did, <hi>Go take the same state and Circumstances,</hi> and so it ought to be. I Answer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When it is to the ruine of Families we are not obliged, as these were no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> that could not remove themselves and Families without ruine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Parallel, put our case with theirs in those times, and it will appear far different, as will appear especially in the second instance when many of them removed for altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. They removed out of a Land over which the wrath of God hung, and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against it, unto a Land where they saw that God was with them, and that is made one ground of their Remove, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 9. 2. They removed to strengthen the Cause of God, which needed them in the Land they removed to. And 3. They were invited by a potent and able Prince and his people, who thereby were obliged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them. 4. There was a final Captivity threatned in the end, by God, unto that Land from which they removed. And in this case for men to remove for Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, was as if Protestant Borderers upon any Popish Country where the inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reigns, which Country they also knew was design'd to ruine, should remove, being invited unto a Neighbouring Nation where the cause of God is, and all the advantages Mentioned. But to remove,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From a Nation where there is a bulk and body of Saints that need the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their Brethren; which is made one argument in the case of them that went in <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s time that they strengthned <hi>Rehoboam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where there is hope of a Resurrection of a good cause, which was no way their case but the contrary;</p>
                  <p>And 3. To remove from Ordinances to a place where the wrath of God is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, or at least, no less.</p>
                  <p>And 4. Where they can promise themselves no provision for their Families, but must put themselves out of their Calling and serve God with distraction, and are like to starve with their Families; In that Case they are not obliged to a remove elsewhere, meerly for the Ordinances sake, but to a forbearance rather and waiting upon God.</p>
                  <p>I shall now give Instances out of the New Testament, and here first: <hi>Let the Prudence,</hi> which our Saviour Christ used in case of appearance of danger, <hi>be considered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I give you the particular instances, I premise these few things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our Lord was wholly free of any the least tincture of sinful fears, therefore what he did is to be resolved into <hi>Prudence,</hi> applying it self to the providence of God; and he, being God as well as Man, could have preserv'd himself until his hour came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hidings or withdrawings: therefore his example herein must needs be for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction to guide us in the like cases.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When his hour to suffer was come, as himself speaks (which had been by a set compact and agreement between the Father and him, made known to the Son; for, <hi>John</hi> 18. 4 it is said, <hi>he knew all things he should suffer,</hi> and elsewhere, <hi>that so it was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)</hi> then indeed he avoided not.</p>
                  <p>These things premised, I come unto the particular Instances of his avoiding danger, and the occasions of them, which we shall find to have been but prudential fore-seeings and warinesses to preserve himself till indeed the hour appointed by his Father, and consented to by himself should come. <hi>Go tell that Fox</hi> (said he) <hi>I do cures to day and to Morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.</hi> But before that time he was managed by the Ordinary providence of God, as to what would befal him, and accordingly applied himself thereto. And hence he becomes an example unto us in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How we are to manage our selves under the Ordinary Providence of God, which we are alway under, not knowing what will be the Event of things.</p>
                  <p>But 2 When we are called to suffer, then we should, after his Example, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, as in case we are necessitated to suffer by Providence we should then arm our selves with the same mind as he did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> An Objection is and hath been made by some, that the reason of his avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, that he was to go and preach over all the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> and therefore it was all one to him when, and whither he did with-draw, since he still was not out of his way; which is not the case of Ordinary Ministers that are bound to a certain place.</p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:154381:191"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Answer is, 1. That be it so, that whither ever he went he still had an employment to wait upon him; yet still it is evident, that the cause of his remove from that place where he was afore, was matter of prudence and avoidence, and that the Instances will shew; and therefore that remains still as an Example for us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. Ministers, who are by the like Providences (as Christ was) taken off, may wait, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>at in some other places unto which they may remove they may have such em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments as the providence of God shall call them to, for the Exercise of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; as the Disciples that were scattered by Persecution, in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. went up and down preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. That was not the ground why Christ did remove, who had not yet gone over the Cities of <hi>Judah;</hi> for we read it expresly said, that he went again to the same place that he was at afore.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Instance that we have of Christ's avoiding danger, is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 12, 13. <hi>Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee. And leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in Capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Zebulon and Naphtali.</hi> That <hi>Galilee,</hi> that he went into, was not that part of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee</hi> which <hi>Herod</hi> had who was of a persecuting Nature, but which <hi>Philip</hi> had (as <note place="margin">Grotius <hi>in locum.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> out of <hi>Josephus</hi> shews) and the occosion of his avoiding was but only when Jesus heard that <hi>John</hi> was cast into prison, namely, by <hi>Herod,</hi> and so it was time for him to look to himself, and thereupon he secured himself. It was but upon hearing that <hi>John</hi> was cast into prison, no more; only rationally thinking his turn might be next.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In like manner we have an account, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3. <hi>When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more Disciples than John (though Jesus baptized not but his Disciples) He left Judea and departed again into Galilee.</hi> Here again, though Christ knew only that the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had heard (which is remote enough from this, that Jesus made and baptized more Disciples than <hi>John)</hi> and although he had a plea for himself that he baptized none, yet upon this occasion he left <hi>Judea</hi> and departed again into <hi>Galilee.</hi> It was that he knew that such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him would contract an envy upon himself, and an <hi>Odium</hi> from the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and so he avoided it, and breaks off, when he was in the midst of an Employment, with as much success as any he had at any time elsewhere afore or after.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We have another Instance, Mat. 12. 14, 15. <hi>Then the Pharisees went out and held a Council against him how they might destroy him: But when Jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is another Instance, Luke 4. 29, 30, 31. <hi>And they rose up and thrust him out of the City, and led him unto the brow of the hill (whereon their City was built) that they might cast him down headlong. But he passing through the midst of them went his way; and came down to Capernaum, a City of Galilee,</hi> &amp;c. and not only went his way for the present, but removed to another place.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We have another Instance, <hi>John</hi> 8. 59. <hi>Then took they up stones to cast at him, but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the Temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is another Instance, <hi>John</hi> 10. 39, 40. <hi>They sought again to take him, but he escaped out of their hand. And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized, and there he abode.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have also Instances of the Apostles.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Who after Christ's Death until his Ascension, met secretly with the doors shut and in the night, John 20. 19. <hi>Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the Disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith, Peace be unto you.</hi> And again a Second time after eight days, <hi>v.</hi> 26. The doors being shut. <hi>And after eight days, again his Disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. After Christ's Ascension, the Church by flying avoided persecution, Acts 8. 1. <hi>And at that time there was a great persecution again the Church which was at Jerusalem, and they were all scattered abroad throughout the Regions of Judah except the Apostles.</hi> And although the Apostles staid because they were extraordinary Officers, and had not a Commission yet from God to depart from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which afterward they had, yet the Church was so lessened by the Disciples scattering abroad (for which the Disciples
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:154381:191"/> had warrant by reason of perscution) That the Apostles might the safelier stay; and we read that for praying and preaching in the like cases they met in the night, and by parts, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 12. <hi>And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Mother of John, whose Surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying, James</hi> and others of the Brethren being in another place, <hi>v.</hi> 17.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Two Cases resolved, whither a person who, is not a Church-member may be the subject of Baptism. Whether a Minister who is not a Pastor, may Administer Baptism.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>I Resolve the cases propounded into these two Questions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whether one that is not a Church-member may be the Subject of Baptism?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether one that is not a Pastor in a particular Relation to persons that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to be baptized may baptize them? And if he Administers it, under what consideration he doth it, whether as a Minister, or otherwise as a private person?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. Unto the first Question I say these two Things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The examples in Scripture do clearly hold forth, that persons that were not in Church-Fellowship were yet baptized.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Instance is of the Eunuch, baptiz'd by <hi>Philip,</hi> Acts 8. If it be said, that he was a Proselyte, and so of the Jewish Church, and upon that ground a subject ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Baptism. The reply is, that his being of the Jewish Church did not make him capable of the Gospel-Baptism, of the Ordinance under the Gospel which we call <hi>Baptism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For when <hi>John</hi> Baptist baptized, he bid them <hi>say not, they had</hi> Abraham <hi>for their Father,</hi> which yet was a ground for Circumcision, as under the old Covenant Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred, but he requires Repentance and Regeneration, which is the Gospel-Initiation into the Kingdom of Heaven:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again <hi>Peter</hi> (Acts 2.) being to baptize Jews, baptizeth them, not upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they were the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but upon Faith and Repentance, which he calls them to. He only tells them, that if they would turn to God, then God would renew the promises unto them and their Children, yet in a Gospel way, namely, by vertue of their being call'd, as the 39 <hi>verse</hi> hath it; So as the ground upon which men were Members of the Jewish Church, and Circumcised, was not the ground upon which they were baptized; And therefore the Eunuch was not baptiz'd upon any such ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. The dispensation of the Covenant was altered, and the application of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances had accordingly an alteration. So then, if he were not baptized as a Member of the Jewish Church, and when he was baptized, was a Member of no Gospel-Church Instituted, then it necessarily follows, that a person who is not a Member of an Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Church, or a particular Congregation, may be the subject of Baptism.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second Instance (which also is an answer to the former Objection) is of the Jaylor, and his houshold, and of those baptized by <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 14. They to be sure were not of the Jewish Church, for the Jaylor was a perfect Heathen before, to the instant of his Conversion, yet he and his Houshold were baptized before Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>If it be said that <hi>Philip</hi> and the Apostles were persons extraordinary. I Answer, That still the extraordinaries of their Office, did only enable them with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power over all Churches, and over all persons with an extraordinary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but could not convey a requisite qualification unto an ordinary person, which was still required however in the subject that was to be baptized. They could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Lord's Supper out of a Church, nor never did; and although they had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power over all Churches, yet that did not make all Churches one Church, but there remained Churches distinct according to that ordinary Capacity of them as Christ had instituted. And so it must be supposed in this Case.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The apparent difference that is between Baptism and the Lord's Supper in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:154381:192"/> intentions, doth shew that the one is properly the Ordinance of a particular Church, and the other of the Universal. </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because Baptism is a baptizing of a single person into Christ, and consequently into the body of Christ (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. imports) and is but an act of a single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son unto a single person (as the Instance of <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> being alone shews) and it belonging not unto a particular Church, as the former Instances declared, it must necessarily belong unto the Universal Church, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4. seems to hold forth, <hi>One Lord, One God, One Baptism, One Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the Lord's Supper, it is as evident that it was properly the Ordinance of a particular Church embodied together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>The bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Christ?</hi> It is the bread which we break, so that there must be a number of persons to celebrate it. For these we must be many, for, says he, <hi>We, being many, are one Bread and one Body,</hi> verse 17. It doth not hold forth the Union of single persons with Christ, or any ingrafting into him, as Baptism doth in the first Initiation; but it holds forth a joynt and a common participation. 'Tis the Nature of the Ordinance it self, for the Institution is, <hi>Eat ye all of this, and drink ye all of this.</hi> Insomuch as the Apostle says, <hi>Tarry one for another,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 33. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much also as it had the Denomination from the meeting or gathering together of many, and therefore was called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Therefore to come together into one place, and to eat the Lord's Supper, are put, as it were, mutually one for the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. I come now to consider the second Question, whether the Child of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son truly godly, not in fellowship with you, may be baptized by one who is not a Pastor, and under what notion, whether as a Minister or no?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I suppose that Infant-baptism of Parents godly is warrantably in its self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I suppose that the Judgment, whether the person is godly, yea or no, whose Child is baptized, properly belongs to him that baptizes it. There is this difference between Baptism and the Administration of the Lord's Supper; That it is a single act of him that baptizeth to the person baptized: but the act of blessing the Bread and Wine <hi>(which we bless)</hi> it is a joynt act together with the Church, and the Minister doth give it to the whole as Christ did. And therefore the Judgment of the Church, that a man is godly, may satisfie the Minister's Conscience for his administring the Lord's Supper among them; he not applying it to this or that person, but in the point of Baptism 'tis otherwise, as is clear.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it be (as by reviewing the first question it appears) the right of men out of Church-fellowship, as well as in Church-fellowship to be baptized: This must be done by some body; and the Judgment that is to be past concerning the person is not incumbent upon a whole Church only or chiefly, but upon the single person that is to baptize. So as for a warrant of his Judging such a person to be godly, and the Child to be godly, it is not absolutely necessary that he have the Judgment of a Church for it. And if there were not a lawful way or means by which, after the Apostles times those out of Church-fellowship, which were converted might be baptized; Then Jesus Christ had not made provision for all times of the Gospel as well as for the first, in so great an Ordinance. If therefore it does lye upon some, those must either be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters or others, if it lyes upon others, you know the inconveniency that will follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that. If it lyes on the Minister, the Question is, whether as a Minister or no? To that I shall give this clear answer, That a man that is set apart by his own vow to God professed by his acceptance of that Calling, when he was called to be a <hi>Minister</hi> in a Church (and it hath the Nature of a vow on his part, and is so accepted of him by God) by vertue of that publique consecration and dedication of himself unto the service of Christ as a <hi>Minister;</hi> he is to be lookt upon as a <hi>Minister,</hi> not only unto them of his own Church, but occasionally also as he shall be call'd to such an act of the Ministry as he singly may perform, as to preach or to baptize, which when he does, he does it as a Minister, and with the blessing of a Minister, and with the promise made to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister. If one come to him with a case of Conscience, as to a Minister of Christ, he hath the blessing of a Minister, and the promise of a Minister and the guidance of a Minister to resolve it, and by like reason, if any one come to him and call him to baptize, he hath authority to do it. And this does no way prejudice our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal principles: for it is a single Act of the Ministry, and but occasionally put forth as he shall be call'd thereto▪ But the Matter of Ordination and of governing the Church
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:154381:192"/> or ruling, it is not a single act, but is to be performed with others; for 'tis an act of authority or power over others, but it is not an act of power above others, or which others have not. Our Presbyterian brethren fail in their practice, and in their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>in that,</hi> they, because they are Ministers, therefore associate themselves together, and take power over the Churches to rule them and govern them whether the Churches do call them or no. And call them to it as Churches they cannot, unless they give away thereby and prejudice that power which is seated within themselves, as in a body, and ought to be exercised among themselves; and not without themselves in a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature that is without them. If I were seated in a Parish that had a Church in it ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of it, and the rest of the Parish came to hear me, I should not look upon my self to preach as a private man to all these that are not in my Church, and as a Minister only to them that are of the Church, but as one set apart to the work of the Ministry; to preach as a Minister to both, as to the matter of preaching: And that (as I take it) by vertue of what is said, <hi>Eph:</hi> 4. 12. <hi>He gave Pastors and Teachers as well</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>for the joynting in of the Saints,</hi> which is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, as well as for the edifying of the body of Christ.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Whether a Church may depose an Offiicer for a Crime which deserves not Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THat a Church may not disclaim an Officer for an offence which is not worthy of Excommunication appears to me evident from this Reason, because you are to exercise the same patience towards an Officer, as an Officer, in matter of Crime, that you are to use to a private Member, and so you are not to disclaim him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Officer, on a lesser account than you would excommunicate him. According to that Rule (which nature dictates) to entreat an Elder as a Father. (And this in case of censure.) This is a main duty of a Church to a Minister, and by a Rule of equity grounded on Nature, in the duty of Children to a Father, not to renounce him for that fault for which they would not renounce a Brother.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> All this runs upon a false Supposition, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that an Officer may not be displaced for a crime cleaving to the Administration of his Office.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because, what crime may be cured by a lesser censure, needs not a greater; but crimes that cleave to the Administration of an Office, may be cured by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of the Officer, which is a lesser censure, therefore there is no need of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which is a greater.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As an Officer cannot be chosen out of the Body, being guilty of some crimes; so the same crimes may be just matter of his displacing after his being chosen.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Objection seems to intimate a distinction between sins cleaving to the Administration of his Office, and such as are otherwise common to him as a Brother, and that for such he may be disclaimed as an Officer, when he could not have been so as a Brother.</p>
                  <p>But 1. I do not see that the Scripture putteth any such distinction between these two sorts of sins, that for the one an Officer should be displaced, when not for the other. I am sure that other sins than such as cleave to the Administration of his Office, are promiscuously put together with the other, and alike forbidden in him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>A Bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ʋbi Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra non distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guie, ibi nec nos distingue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re debemus.</note>
                     <hi>good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach.</hi> And so it <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 2. <hi>That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</hi> So as the case of any such crimes is all one with those cleaving to the Administration of his Office.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This your distinction doth run upon a false Supposition; as if the Subject to be considered in your treating with an Officer in matter of crime, were not the person, and that as he is a Saint and Brother, as well in sins of his Office, as in other sins; for though he is invested with a relation of Office (by vertue of his Gifts, and your choice) Yet the discharge of his Office faithfully is from his Grace; and the neglect of it (for which in such a case you would disclaim him) is but a <hi>fruit of his sin,</hi> from contrary corruption, and a failing as he is a Saint, so as in matter of sin you cannot
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:154381:193"/> distinguish his being a Saint and his being an Officer. Surely it is in this as in other Relations: a Brother being an husband as well as a brother, a Brother being a Master as well as a Brother, and he being an Officer as well as a Brother all these Relations do oblige them to several Duties) which, if they fail to discharge, you are to deal with them all as Saints failing in duty, seeing they are defects of Grace, and you have not in Church-fellowship one way of dealing with an Husband, if he sins against his Relation, another with a Master of a Family if against his; and so neither a peculiar one for an Officer if he sin against his. All the duties of the dispensation and of his Office, are but the duties of his particular Calling, and Relation, wherein, if he fail, (through corruption) he is to be dealt with as another brother who fails in his Relation, or neglects the duties of his Calling and no otherwise than the same Officer should be, If he sins in any other State: And though it be a sin against the Church more immediatly; yet it being but a sin, God's Ordinance is to have it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, the same way that all sins are, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15. 16, 17. you cannot shew a Warrant that God hath given this peculiar power in this case over an Officer to disclaim him as an Officer, in way of an Ordinance, till he grow so hardned as he deserves Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
                  <p>Your first Reason for it is, because such Crimes may be cured by this as a lesser cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and so needs not a greater.</p>
                  <p>In this your Reason, if you view the expression, you will find that you again speak upon a false supposition, as if we had affirmed, that crimes in the dispensation of his Office did always need the Excommunication of the Officer. But our exception lies in this, that when his Crime needed not Excommunication in your own Judgment: But you thought that to be too great a censure, You should disclaim him as an Officer, when as on an Officer there is no such censure to be inflicted for matter of Crime in his Office, until it comes to that height as it deserves Excommunication. And that therefore it was violence in you to be so hasty to proceed so severely till he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 'Tis true, that simply disclaiming an Officer (if for insufficiency) is less than Excommunication: But then 'tis not a censure, for that respects Crime, But to disclaim an Officer, in case of Crime and Sin, is interpretative as much as Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. For if dispensed according to the word, it should not be done till he were past cure; and so should be joyned, or rather included, in Excommunication.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The fault we find lies in this, that you make this invention of disclaiming an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, a Church censure, and so an Ordinance of God coming between Admonition and Excommunication to cure a man, which we affirm you have no warrant for: So that though it be a less punishment than Excommunication (if he had deserved it) would be, that being a delivering up to Satan, yet you must not take on you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent other punishments, as you are a Church, than God hath ordained; you have your power, your honour, your lives from Christ &amp; your punishment (as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6. excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is called) from him also. In a Colledge you might invent twenty less pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments than expulsion: But in a Church you must invent none that God hath not ordained: And you have not the power that mens Courts have of varying their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments who having Law to warrant them, use less violence under that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than you, who have neither God's Law nor man's to justifie your proceeding herein: And whereas you think because 'tis a less punishment, it may cure him, and so he should not need Excommunications. I answer</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which must cure must have God's blessing and promise of blessing annexed, and so be his Institution: but that this is such, we desire a warrant. It may cure him as a Cross (as an injustice done in a Civil Court may, and an unlawful suspension may do the man much good) but that is an accident, and no warrant for you to inflict it.</p>
                  <p>Yea, 2. What is it in him you would cure? would you cure him as an Officer? or cure him as a Saint and Brother? if as an Officer (as would seem by inflicting punishment answerable to his sin, he sinning in his Office you would punish him in his Office to cure him) how improper a remedy is this for his cure? which casts him off, destroys him as an Officer, Lames him for use and exercise of his Office puts him out of it for ever? Doth that Surgeon cure a hand, that in going about to make it sound, makes it as an hand forever unuseful, though he leaves it a member still? Doth any man punish his Members so for failing in their Office? Will they cut off till there be no hope? Would you cure
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:154381:193"/> him as a Saint or Brother when you must forgoe that distinction of punishing him as an Officer for Crimes in his Office, when not as a Brother, seeing he is considered by you as a Brother in the time of his Office.</p>
                  <p>And therefore ye are to proceed with him for sins in his Office, as with a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he have committed sins, and use the same means for his cure that you would do to a Brother for his sins, you must use admonition and patience, till his sin comes to that height that it deserves casting off as a Brother by Excommunicating of him. Yea, you ought to treat him with more patience in this kind than you would do to Brother, for he is more. Entreat him as a Father.</p>
                  <p>2 <hi>Reas.</hi> Your second Reason drawn from the instance of <hi>Abiashar,</hi> who remained a member of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, when put from his Priest-hood, the only warrant from Scripture you alledge, how remote is it from the case in hand?</p>
                  <p>For 1. It was not an act of Ecclesiastical, but Civil power, The text says, <hi>Solomon</hi> thrust out <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the Priest-hood; it was the King did it, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 27.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Not for a sin in the dispensation of his Office, but for High Treason: So it serves not your purpose at all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For which Treason he was a man of Death, <hi>verse</hi> 26. and that he remained alive and so in their Jewish Church, was from the King's pardon, <hi>I will not at this time put thee to death,</hi> verse 26. He only thrust him from the Priesthood, which he forfeited in forfeiting his life: And so was part of the punishment included in that other Death.</p>
                  <p>Yea, 4. It was done to fulfil a particular word of Prophecy; and no way as a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ordinance to cure him, so, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>That he might fulfil the word of the Lord, which he spake concerning the house of Eli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 5. In respect to his Office, <hi>Solomon</hi> was so far from heightening his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more than to another Brother, that he therefore spared his life, <hi>because he had born the Ark of the Lord.</hi> Whereas he put <hi>Adonijah</hi> and <hi>Joab</hi> to death, being in the same Treason with him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. As an Officer cannot be chosen out of the body, being guilty of some Crimes, so the same Crimes may be just matter of displacing after his chosing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. If you have those Crimes, mentioned, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. in your Eye take them but as eminent infirmities that stand with sincerity, as there the Apostle speaks of them, yet if eminent, such an one (if other supply may be had) is not to be chosen; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That those sins and infirmities there mentioned are not only such as are found in the dispensation of his Office; but others also, as was said afore. So that you must say, that, not only for sins cleaving to his administration, but of any other kind he is to be disclaimed.</p>
                  <p>And 2. Those infirmities are mentioned as Rules for the choice of Officers, not of cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out one chosen, as also to shew what an one a Bishop ought to be after choice, so <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>If a man desires the Office of a Bishop:</hi> And so is to be chosen, <hi>let him be blameless,</hi> and it respects choice. So of a Decon, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Let him first be proved, then let him use the Office of a Deacon.</hi> The Rule therefore respects choice, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years,</hi> &amp;c. still those Rules were intended to direct choice. But, if after choice, these as infirmities were found in them, he says not, they are to be cast out unless obstinate, and so it proves more than an infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; so as those places will no way afford a ground for this.</p>
                  <p>And for your inference thence; That if he may not be chosen, being guilty of such Crimes as are there mentioned; that therefore after choice, when guilty, they are just matter to cast him out.</p>
                  <p>The Answer is, 1. We grant it, if obstinacy be joined to them, and so he deserve Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: but simply, the guilt of them as infirmities (and they are no more till obstinacy and impenitency be added to them) is not just matter to cast out after choice and Ordination.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If you mean otherwise, that the sole guilt of them should require it: There is not the same Reason for not chosing at first and disclaiming afterwards. There is a vast dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to be put.</p>
                  <p>For, 1 In and before Choice there is an arbitrariness and freedom, and no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to chuse this or that man: But after he is chosen and ordained, there is an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by a solemn Covenant, the Covenant of God; and by Ordination the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:154381:194"/> of him unto the service of Christ in that Church. Hence therefore, because their choice is an act, wherein they are free, and wherein they give so great a Testimony to the Man, to be qualified according to the Apostles Rules; they become partakers of his sins, if they chose him with those Infirmities, and so ought not to chuse him, because it is a sin.</p>
                  <p>But when he is once chosen, and so great a Covenant passed, and so great an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance as Separation passed upon him, then those his Infirmities (though sins in him) are not approved of by you, though you disclaim him not; if you use the means God hath appointed for the cure of him, which is Admonition with patience; yea and by vertue of your Covenant you are to bear with them (if they be but Infirmities) though in his Administration of his Office, because that Covenant cannot be so arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily broken as it was made (as your Rule would make it) but binds, as all other Covenants do, till some other Rule warrants a disclaim. The same Rule for choosing and disclaiming, is not commensurable each to other:</p>
                  <p>Which 2. Appears in this, that not only those crimes here mentioned, but some cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances also, though no crimes, are given as Rules to divert from a Choice, which yet by reason of the Covenant passed, ought not to procure a disclaiming after Choice. For <hi>v.</hi> 6. He is not to be one newly come to the Faith; (though never so well Gifted, for that he supposeth, and so in those days it sometimes fell out through the effusion of the Holy Ghost at first) lest he fall into Pride, but if chosen once, should that have put him out? Or if he is one against whom after he was chosen, those without had raised ill reports, should this necessitate a disclaiming, because this, if it had fallen out afore, should have diverted his Choice? v. 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. See this in other Covenants that pass: Marriage is a Covenant of God, which until made, many infirmities and circumstances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may and ought to divert one from chusing such or such a person, which after cannot be a warrant for a divorce: for it is the Covenant of God. You must divorce in no case, but such as God in his Word gives power and warrant for.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. See it in another Instance more near the case. A private Christian, that seeks admission, being found guilty of any crime, without Repentance: The Rule for his admission is, that he must testifie Repentance, and so satisfie the Church of the truth of his Grace and Repentance of those sins: But if he be once admitted, and in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with you, you ought not presently to disclaim him as a Brother, till he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but to admonish him as a Brother, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 13. 15. and with patience bear with him, using not only one admonition, but a second also, ere you reject him, <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 10. and this in case of Heresie; the most dangerous of sins to Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, and not indeed to reject, till it comes to obstinacy; because now he is in Covenant with you; now the proportion as strongly holds between the Choice of an Officer, and his casting out as an Officer; and the admission of a Brother, and his casting out as a Brother; the Covenant that binds to the Officer, being as strong as that which binds unto a Brother.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Upon commission of such crimes, he is made uncapable for the present of Choice (until Repentance) but not so, for the same sins after Choice, unless you would make him fall in his Office, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and make him uncapable of admonition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no way <hi>par ratio,</hi> before and after chusing.</p>
                  <p>Again 6. If a man had been guilty of such crimes, yet if he had repented, he might be chosen: Then especially after Choice, if he be guilty of them, upon Repentance he might be continued in his Place; why otherwise would you have received him in again? and for his Repentance, why should not all the same means and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience be first used, as is used for a Brother's, and so not a casting off, as there is not the casting off a Brother.</p>
                  <p>Yea 7. If an Officer should be thus disclaimed, he would not be under all those Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances that a Brother as a Brother is under, but in a worse case far: For towards a Brother, Christ hath appointed admonition upon admonition with patience (till such obstinacy be added, as it justly calls for Excommunication, which as it were unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly they pronounce upon him) as means to reclaim him ere he be renounced as a Brother; and should it not be thus to an Officer? An Officer is capable of sin in his Office, as well as a Brother; (for he that is most spiritual may be tempted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1, 2.) and so is capable of reproof in his Office, as well as a Brother, <hi>Coll.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Say to Archippus, fulfil thy Ministry;</hi> and also of publick rebuke for sins proved by two or
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:154381:194"/> three Witnesses that are publick, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19, 20. For, as appears by the coherence, those Rules concern Elders, yet so as in these proceedings they are to exercise not only tthe same, but more respect and patience than to a Brother.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>v.</hi> 1. They are gentle unto him as a Father; and <hi>v.</hi> 19. They are so far from censuring him hastily, that they are not to receive an accusation, or listen to it but upon the Testimony of two or three approved ones. Surely then the case is evident, they are, as <hi>v.</hi> 20. to rebuke them openly, but no more: Till it comes to Excommunication, you find not a tittle for disclaiming:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. That less admonition ripens an Officers sin sooner than a Brother's, for displacing him as an Officer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The Rules by which you must judge of the ripeness of his sin, must be in the Word; now shew that the Limits of proceeding against an Officer, are more strict than against a Brother.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis true, his sin, is aggravated more, but still not ripe for rejection, until such impenitency and obstinacy be added to it, as would procure Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, we add this, That if he were obstinate and impenitent in his sin, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served Excommunication, yet it doth not appear that thereby he fell from all future right to his Office, so as that you are free instantly to send for another. From the Scripture we have not learned, that the Relation is utterly broken and made void, as that of a Brother is not by Excommunication: But if upon that Ordinance he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, as you are bound to receive him as a Brother, so as your Officer again, for you cannot shew a ground that the one Relation should be more evacuated than the other. Excommunication is not a casting off but in order to Repentance, which restores him <hi>ad pristinum statum,</hi> to his former state.</p>

                     <p>Of Anointing with Oyl.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>James</hi> 5. 14, 15.</bibl>
                     <q>Is any sick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with Oyl in the name of the LORD: And the Prayer of Faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up: And if he have comitted sins they shall be forgiven him.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Anointing spoken of in this Text, is not the Anointing spoken of, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 13. by which the Apostles healed those that were sick through a miraculous Gift: But it is a standing Ordinance to confirm the promise of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Church Members; as will appear from the following Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Argument is taken from what anointing with Oyl is here joyned with, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Elders Prayers,</hi> which are a standing Ordinance to this purpose even for the cure of the sick.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the Precepts besides in this Epistle are about things which concern the Church for ever. And that which this Anointing is joyned with (namely, the prayer of the Elders) is such also. It were strange therefore if this alone should be extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument may be taken from the <hi>Persons</hi> that are to be sent for, who have the power to <hi>Administer</hi> it; namely, the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not said, Send for Men who have healing Gifts, but for Elders.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who were standing Officers, and that, of a Church which was to continue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Elders in every Church had not then such miraculous Healing-Gifts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Gifts of Healing and those of prophecy, by Wisdom and Knowledge, which enable Men for Eldership, were in those times variously dispensed; and not both to the same Persons (excepting Extraordinary Officers, as Apostles and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists) but to one was given the Gift of Healing, to others a Word of Wisdom and Knowledge, that enabled them to be Elders, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9, 11:</p>
                  <p>The third Argument is drawn from the <hi>Persons</hi> to whom it was to be <hi>Administred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:154381:195"/>
                  <p> 1. They were <hi>sick Persons,</hi> or infirm. If it had been extraordinary Healing, it would have extended further, even to the blind, the deaf and the dumb: but this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling reacheth only to these who were sick of Diseases curable, it being no miraculous Ordinance. 2. They were members of the Church, not unbelievers; for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is, <hi>If any be sick among you:</hi> And therefore the Elders of that Church are to be sent for.</p>
                  <p>Now Miraculous Healing did,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Extend to all sorts, Unbelievers as well as Believers.</p>
                  <p>Yea, 2. To them chiefly, as all miracles did, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 22. it is said of Tongues.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, 3. The Apostles themselves who had Gifts of Healing, seldom wrought any cure upon Believers that were sick: So <hi>Paul</hi> did not heal <hi>Epaphroditus,</hi> Philem. 1. 2.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Argument may be taken from the generality of the extent of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, even to all persons in a Church. <hi>(If any among you be sick)</hi> which argues it not to be extraordinary, For when any was healed by an extraordinary Gift, it was by a Faith of Miracles concurring; which was never general, to heal any, or all, but particular, reaching only to such a Person as God would heal, and who was presented, and his Faith stirred up. There was no Universal Rule given for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Healings.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Argument is taken from the <hi>Means</hi> commanded upon all such occasions, which generally is Oyl. Now the extraordinary Gift of Healing was not confined to <hi>Oyl,</hi> but might be applied without means. It had been enough to have said, <hi>Rise and walk.</hi> So likewise some were extraordinarily healed by other means, as <hi>Napkins, the Apostles shadow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another Argument may be taken from the generality of the Command, which enjoins every one that is sick to send and seek out for this cure. Now if extraordinary Gifts were meant, then in those times Men should not have died; For extraordinary Gifts of Healing failed not to effect the cure where there was a Warrant to apply them, as here there is unto any. Every one is to send, and they are to come and anoint every one.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore intended as an Ordinance to confirm the promise of Health unto Church-Members, for the words of the text are, <hi>They shall be healed.</hi> And because his promise to dispense this outward mercy is not absolute, but indefinite, therefore the Seal is to be taken as such also. For this Seal is to confirm Faith, and Faith is to be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the promise, and the Seal to both. And yet it is of use; for though this Seal assures not the party unto whom it is applied, that he shall be healed; yet it gives a more certain evidence of God's seriousness and faithful care over the Bodies of his Saints, to preserve them in Sickness, than to conser on them any other outward Mercy: their bodies being most dear to him, next their Souls, and their lives precious in his sight, and it being one of his attributes, to be the God that heals them; he therefore hath shewn and confirmed that this is so, by a Seal annexed to the Promise of Healing, when he hath annexed a Seal to no other outward Mercy: So that it Seals up to our Faith, the certainty and faithfulness of that promise it self in its indefiniteness, though not of the infallible fulfilling it unto this or that party, yet so as to raise the heart of every one.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. This is to make more Sacraments than two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There are no more than two Seals of the Covenant of Grace: But for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ends, and to seal other Promises, there may be more. As that of the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow is in force unto this day, to confirm the not destroying the World by Water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But this Seal is for remission of sins, as it was then used; for it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the Text, <hi>They have committed sins, they shall be forgiven,</hi> and so there was an extraordinary Healing, at which their Souls were often converted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Remission of sins there spoken of, is not that general and eternal forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of all sins promised in the Covenant of Grace; nor is this the Sacrament of such a Remission; but of the Remission and taking off of that Temporary guilt which might be in any particular sins committed by the persons provoking God to lay that sickness upon them. Which is evident from the Apostles speaking Hypothetically, <hi>If he have committed sins;</hi> which argues it not meant of the general forgiveness; for then there were no <hi>if</hi> to come in: it being certain, that all sick persons whatever have in that sense sinned. <hi>All have sinned;</hi> and <hi>he that says he hath no sin, deceiveth himself.</hi> The
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:154381:195"/> meaning therefore is, That if there be any special sin, the Temporal Guilt whereof hath, in a particular manner, provoked God to lay this sickness on him, it shall be remitted And so forgiveness here is but the removal of that guilt considered as in order to this Punishment. And thus it is taken, <hi>Psa.</hi> 78. 38. <hi>He forgave their Iniquity, and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them not.</hi> And so, that it should be a Seal of such a forgiveness, and of the promise of being restored, is but to be a Seal of an outward temporary mercy, and so, not at all of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But all Sacraments, being Seals, are annexed to absolute Promises; and when rightly used in Faith, have certainly their effect: But so this hath not; for then none should die that in Faith do use it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> True; All Sacraments of the Covenant of Grace are such, and the Promises to which they are annexed are such; and God hath annexed a Seal to assure our Faith, and hope of the fulfilling of Spiritual Promises, rather than of any other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mercy, but yet he may have appointed a Seal for the confirmation of our Faith as to the Performance of them too. And of this nature is that other Ordinance, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Imposition of hands, for encrease of Gifts; Not that always, when rightly used in Faith, it hath its effect infallibly; But it is a Means appointed to convey the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing▪ and confirms the Promise of giving Gifts to Men, which yet is but indefinitely performed, as being of God's good pleasure. Yea, one end of this Ordinance of anointing with Oyl (when ever in use) is here made but indefinite, and with a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>If he hath committed sins:</hi> That is, in case he hath. And so it may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to this or that person with a supposition, if he be one of those (as he may be) unto whom the Promise belongs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 4. That anointing, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. and so, healing, was extraordinary: and how can this here be then an Ordinary Ordinance, unless the same gift were continued now?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> So Imposition of hands did in the Primitive Times serve extraordinarily to convey extraordinary Gifts of the Holy Ghost: Yet was it ordained to serve as an Ordinance of Encreasing Gifts, unto the Worlds end; And why may not this be so converted also?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 5. This gives countenance unto the Papists <hi>Extreme Ʋnction,</hi> and condemns the Reformed Churches for rejecting it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> retains almost all Ordinances; only she hath perverted them. As she hath perverted this from being an Ordinance of restoring Health, and forgiving the Temporary Guilt of particular sins provoking God to that Judgment, to become a Sacrament of Justification and forgiveness of all sins, and so, a Seal of the Covenant of Grace; and that not for the sick, but for all dying persons, when past recovery, in which case it should not be used.</p>
                  <p>Now, 2. The Reformed Churches, seeing that such a Sacrament could not be, and that this must needs be a perversion of it, did justly reject it as they used it: Only in rejecting it (as in some other things) they went too far, even denying it to have that use of restoring the sick, as a Seal of the promise, and an indefinite means to convey that blessing, which God in mercy hath appointed it to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 1. We see here God's care over our Bodies, as well as over our Souls, in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting an Ordinance for Sickness and restoring to Health; and his full provision by Ordinances for every Thing, and every Condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 2. See also God's especial Hand in that Mercy of restoring his Children unto Health, and of blessing Physick and Means unto them, rather than to Unbelievers; though it be but a common Mercy. And therefore believers should exercise a special Faith and dependance in the use of the means for recovery, beyond what ordinarily they use in other means for other outward Mercies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 3. We should raise our Faith up to God with more hope as to this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than about any other outward Mercies; for the promise of this hath a special Seal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 4. We may infer, that God doth afflict with sickness for particular sins.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 5. We may infer, that yet he doth not always do so, therefore an <hi>if</hi> is put in, <hi>If he have committed sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 6. From hence a proof may be fetcht, that Elders only should administer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; as here they only are to anoint. And if the lesser Sacrament be appropriated to them, then the greater much more.</p>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:154381:196"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 7. It should be one ground of further honouring Elders, that God hath made them means of conveying health, as well to our Bodies as our Souls. So that if Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians be to be honoured (as you have it in <hi>Eccles.)</hi> then they much more, even with a double honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 8. We may infer, that it is not necessary that all the Church should be present. The Elders only are to be sent for, since such Rules are given by the Apostle, as may suit all Churches in all Circumstances; But now the Church may consist of so many, that all the members cannot meet without inconvenience to the sick Party; And the Persons sick may be so many, that the Church cannot meet so often; The Elders therefore are set apart for the purpose, and may, and ought, to attend all such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 9. Yet the Elders must be sent for by the Parties; and that whilst there is hope of recovery, and not when they are a dying.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ʋse</hi> 10. Take notice here of the Priviledge of Church Members above other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. <hi>If any among you,</hi> that is, of a Church: and therefore it follows, <hi>send for the Elders of the Church.</hi> If thou beest out of Church-Fellowship, and fallest sick, thou wantest one Ordinance of recovery which a Church-member hath, and unto which there is both a Promise and a Seal annexed.</p>
                  <p>The Toleration and Liberty of Conscience which we desire is, that we may not be forced to communicate as Members in these Parishes where we dwell, but may have liberty to have Congregations of such persons who give good testimony of their godliness and peaceableness, and yet out of tenderness of Conscience, cannot commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in their Parishes, but do voluntarily offer themselves to joyn in such Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; which how it may best stand with the peace of the Kingdom, we humbly leave to the consideration of the Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>This is our request; The first part whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That we may not be forced to communicate as Members in those Parishes where we dwell▪ was in effect granted by the Sub-Committee of Divines, and therefore we dispute it not. The other part, That we may have liberty to have Congregations, being denied us as unlawful for the Magistrate to grant, we humbly offer the considerations which follow.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the lawfulness of Gathering Churches out of other Churches. How if rightly stated it is not a Separation. That the Christian Magistrate may lawfully tolerate such Churches.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THAT the lawfulness of this our desire to be indulged us by the State, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, we humbly present these two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Principles upon which our selves do go in this desire.</item>
                     <item>2. The Reasons upon which the State may indulge it unto us.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. It is not a separation as from no Churches, but a secession as from such Churches as we cannot, as our Judgment stands, with a good Conscience continue Members in, and wherein by reason thereof, we should want the enjoyment of the Lord's Supper and other Ordinances. And we desire that this profession of ours not to continue Members, may be but as charitably interpreted, as our Presbyterian Brethren would desire that their profession in one of their Petitions should be, wherein they profess that they cannot with a good Conscience continue to officiate in the Administration of the Lord's Supper as Pastors in their Congregations, whilst no further power for Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension of persons who appear unto them scandalous, from the Sacrament, is given them; and that they shall in Conscience be enforced to lay down their Ministries; and many of them in private and in publick have said, that they must turn Independents. Now as to them and their Consciences as Ministers, such an evil doth arise as would make them lay down their Ministers; so to us, as Members, there ariseth so much as causeth us not to renounce, but to withdraw from present Communion. The same kind of Principle that they now go upon, did we go upon, in withdrawing from our Parishes, which Principle they now hold forth, to persuade a yielding by this State unto that Rule they have presented to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:154381:196"/> 2. It is not a gathering of Churches out of Churches, as it hath been interpreted; which imports, 1. An activeness to persuade men from their Churches, and to gain Proselites by all ways of industry, which the State may put restraint upon. 2. It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a rending them from those Churches, whilst there yet remains an obligation to continue in them, and to remain Members of those Churches; but such a rending we acknowledge to be unlawful. But we desire in the behalf of those that are scrupled in Communion with their Churches, and whose Consciences their Ministers cannot satisfie, and whom in that case they ought not for ever to retain among them without Ordinances, nor upon whom in such a case an indissoluble obligation lieth; we desire that these, rather than they, that remain out of Ordinances, may be gathered into new Churches; and such Churches, wherein they may enjoy for substance the same Ordinances, and the same means of Edification, as will save them, and build them up to life eternal, as well as in the Parish Churches, others of the Saints of God, who can and do communicate therein, do enjoy them; we may as well build up such Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches, as the Reformed Churches have built up their several Members amongst them, though differing each from other; as in <hi>England</hi> under Episcopacy, and without power given to Ministers to cast out the scandalous; and as those in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> or the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is not to set up one Church against another, <hi>Altare versus,</hi> Altar against Altar, but one Sister-Church by another, as the Dutch and French Churches in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are and have been unto the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> and the Parishes thereof; and this for the common edification of all sorts of Saints, and the whole Mystical Body of Christ, who otherwise are kept divided from Christ in his greatest Ordinances, and exasperated more one against another.</p>
                  <p>Now that this forbearance or indulgence of liberty from the common Rule esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht, and hitherto continued in this Church of <hi>England,</hi> may without sin by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate (of whom we humbly seek it) be granted to us, we humbly present this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reason. That which is not unlawful, nor contrary to the Word of God for the Magistrates of this Kingdom (who have put this Case to us) to allow; nor destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the Peace of the Kingdom, this the Magistrates of this Kingdom may allow to us without sin. But this Request of ours is such.</p>
                  <p>The Proposition in it self is clear, and the Parliaments willingness to do it, they have expressed in their own Ordinance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I shall prove that it is not unlawful, nor contrary to the Word of God, for the Magistrates of this Kingdom to allow the Liberty which we request. The contrariety to the Word of God for the Magistrate to grant this, must necessarily lie in one of these two things, or both; either that it is so as to the Magistrate's Judgment, who hath established the Rule of Communion, or else that in the verity and truth of the thing it self, the nature of the Rule by him establish'd, is such as is immutably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God in his Word, and a command also of that high nature, as that it is not lawful for him to grant this Indulgence of swerving from it. That in either of these cases it would be unlawful to him, we do acknowledge. And look by how many degrees this Request of ours falls short of such an height of contrariety as this is, either in the Magistrate's Conscience, or in the thing it self, so many grounds and degrees of safety, as well as simple lawfulness there is as to the Magistrate's Conscience herein to grant it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If to the Magistrate's Conscience and Judgment, the Rule should in that wherein we desire a Liberty, be prudential and <hi>humani juris,</hi> of humane right, though about spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, which himself may vary and alter as may suit best for the Subjects of this Kingdom; then he may lawfully grant us this Liberty; for <hi>Quicun{que} potest Legem condere, potest etiam Privilegium concedere,</hi> Whoever may make a Law, may also grant a Priviledge, whereof this reason is given, <hi>Privilegium est Lex privata quaedam, ergo ab eo maxime dari potest, qui potest Legem universalem condere. A Priviledge is a certain private Law, and therefore it may chiefly be given by him, who can make the Ʋniversal Law.</hi> This (as becomes us) we humbly leave to the Judgment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Magistrate himself; yet withal humbly propound these considerations. The unlawfulness of granting this (as to the Magistrate's Conscience) must be either in respect to the <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> or <hi>ad quem;</hi> that is, either in regard of the leaving the Parish-Churches wherein men scrupled do live, or in the setting up distinct Churches from them: For of these two parts only is what we desire made up of.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:154381:197"/> 1. As to the first; The obligation for men that dwell in the Precincts of a Parish cannot be such, as that it should be unlawful for the Magistrate to give allowance, for men dwelling in Parishes, to be of another Church than <hi>that</hi> in that Parish: For the bounding of Parishes in this Kingdom, after the manner that now they are, was by a prudential Law, and therefore being the Magistrate's own Ordinance, it may be by him dispensed with. And although that now <hi>de facto,</hi> and thorough long continuance, Churches by this Ordinance have been formed up in Parishes, and that those men that desire this Liberty, have been Members of some Church therein; yet it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for the Magistrate to give them leave to cease to be Members of those Churches, and retain their dwellings, and to become Members of some distinct Church collected out of many Parishes. For, 1. The Magistrate might permit the People of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be cast generally into Churches otherwise bounded, without sin, and therefore may allow and permit particular Members who are scrupled, to cease to be Members of the Parish-Churches they are and were in: For otherwise this form of Parishes, now there is a Church-State in them, is by reason of that State, as it were conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, and so exempted from all alteration by the Magistrate or themselves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The late Ordinance seems to permit as much as we have said to the Servants and Retinue of the King, his Children, and Noblemen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor is this unlawful to the Magistrates Conscience in respect of the <hi>Terminus ad quem, viz.</hi> to permit setting up new Churches of men having left the Churches they were in; For, 1. If it were so, then they cannot Erect by their Authority in this Kingdom any new Church: But this they have done; as for instance, <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and the Inns of Court, authorizing them for all Ordinances of Worship and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though the most, or many of the Members came up out of several other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes throughout the whole Kingdom: And such is the case likewise of the King's Houshold and Noblemens Families, instanced in before: Besides, might not the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate give leave to any company of true Worshippers of God to set up a new Church, if they removed their dwellings and made a new Parish, even as lawfully as to grant a new Corporation?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. But it may be objected, That the sin lies in neither of these, but in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting men to set up Churches of another Constitution and Government from what is Established by the Rule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We reply, That we do not set up Churches of another Constitution, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same Ordinances for substance as the Churches have which we leave, and not taking in any Members but whom our Brethren may, or will acknowledge meet to be Members of Churches, such as are Saints and truly godly, though of differing Judgment from them. And as for Presbyterial Government, there are none, nay not those that hold it to be by Divine Right, who judge that it is of the Essence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a Church, though a necessary Ordinance therein, for the preserving of it pure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. But 2. If you will suppose that Differences in the framing of Churches should make them of another Constitution, yet the Magistrate might permit them: For, 1. This State did permit the Dutch and French Churches, when of a differing, if not of as differing a Constitution (in these respects) from the Churches amongst us then, as these of ours, which we desire, are now, who yet in continuance of time were become as Natives, and understood our Tongue. The Bishops, when they would have reduced them unto their Government, urged this very thing, and yet prevailed not in it, in the worst times. Again, 2. If a company of Scotch-men inhabiting among us, scrupling kneeling, and the Government by Bishops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had then petitioned our State, as was in Consultation, to have Churches according to their Order and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; might not our State then have permitted them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. It may be objected, That though it were lawful for the Magistrate to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit leaving or removing from these Churches, and to set up new and distinct Churches simply considered; yet the ground and principle upon which we do it is unlawful, because we leave those Churches upon an Errour, <hi>viz.</hi> that we cannot without sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so to permit them upon this Errour is unlawful for the Magistrate to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We reply, 1. The Magistrates Conscience need not be scrupled to permit what is in it self in the outward Act, warrantable, to them that yet do it out of an erring Conscience. We have all in the Assembly professed, that if we could agree in
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:154381:197"/> the same practices, though upon differing Principles, which were openly professed (whereof the one or the other must be an Errour) yet we would not only permit th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, but rejoyce in it. Magistrates in such cases when the outward Act is lawful, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbs not the outward Peace, enquire not into Principles: The Apostles themselves rejoyced in Christ Preached, though they allowed not the Principles of all that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; <hi>If Christ be Preached out of envy, yet I will rejoyce,</hi> says the Apostle; yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will appear if it shall come to be debated, that the Magistrate may tollerate an outward Act, which is evil as to his Conscience, as well as an Act, which outwardly may be good, only the Principle being erroneous: And that he may do this, when there is not only an erroneous Principle, but an hardness of heart in men that desire it of the Magistrate; for so <hi>Moses</hi> did in the case of Polygamy, and that for the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Jews hearts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ground would utterly make void the Ordinance of Parliament concerning us, in that last part of it: For when the Honourable Houses did put it to our conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how far tender Consciences that come not up to the Rule, may be born withal, they judging their own Rule to be lawful, must needs suppose all those tender Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that could not come up to it, to be in an errour; and so far judge their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to be unlawful, and yet are willing to indulge some practices to them, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this erring Conscience. And therefore the Magistrate in Conscience may indulge this to us, unless it can be demonstrated by our Brethren, that there is such a peculiar sinfulness in this Principle in its contrariety to the Rule, as the Magistrate cannot indulge it of all other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This ground will put an impossibility upon the Magistrate (if differing in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about Church-Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from our Brethrens Principles) ever to grant them by way of Indulgence, much lest to Establish by a Law what they have so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly sought: Nor indeed can our Brethren (if they be of this Opinion) petition the Magistrate for this. For instance; our Brethren have desired power of judging of scandal for Suspension, to be lodged in the Elderships, as that which belongs to them <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> if the Honourable Houses be never convinced in their Consciences, but do judge those that request it, upon this ground, to be in an errour, then they can never so much as indulge this to them, much less by an Authoritative Law give forth this Jurisdiction to them over the Subjects of this Kingdom. This Principle, besides what other Reasons the Honourable Houses have had, will teach them to deny it. And then because some, or perhaps most of our Brethren hold National and Provincial As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, to be <hi>Divino Juro,</hi> and thereby do challenge a power of Judicature and Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over all mens Consciences, yea, over that of the Supreme Magistrates, in matters which they shall discern to be scandalous and unchristian, and the Magistrate withal, thinks this Principle to be, not only an Errour, but of as much danger to his Authority, as what this of ours can be pretended to be in the Church, the Magistrate hereby will be constrained to undo (upon the discovery of this Principle) what he hath set up. Yea and further, it is a Principle of many of our Brethren, that the Church Universal is a Politique Body in the whole, and the parts of it <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and that every El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is an Elder of the Church Universal, and so may and ought to unite into general Councils with the same right of Jurisdiction that National or Congregational Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies have. The Supreme Magistrates of <hi>Europe</hi> judging this an Errour (as they well may, and yet these are the Principles of many of our Presbyterian Brethren, if not of the most) they are taught hereby, not to grant the Presbyterial Government, the Principles whereof tend to this, even the setting up a Body of Elders invested with Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, unto which <hi>Divino Jure</hi> all Churches and Christian Subjects and Kingdoms must be subject, and so a Forreign Power Ecclesiastical is set over all Kingdoms, in an Aristocratical way of Government, as was the Pope in a Monarchical way, though with this difference, that there is a renouncing of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the one, but a requiring subjection upon pain of Excommunication in both.</p>
                  <p>This may suffice touching the Magistrates Conscience in relation to what may be supposed his Principles and Practices. Next we come to the Nature of the Rule of Institution it self, which Christ hath laid upon Members of Churches in respect of departing from other Churches, and setting up new. The obligation (say we) laid by Christ in this respect, is not such, but that the Magistrate may permit it with a good Conscience. The lawfulness or unlawfulness hereof (if it be said to lie in respect to Christ's Rule of Institution) must accordingly be measured by what in the Rule
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:154381:198"/> given by Christ is by Institution and also by considering what sort of Institution and Obligation it is, whether it be such as the Magistrate cannot dispense withal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin. Let us therefore consider the Nature of the Rule.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may be taken for granted by the Magistrate (as it is acknowledged by us) that Church-Fellowship is by the Institution of Christ; so as both every Believer is obliged to be of some Church, where he may enjoy Ordinances; as also that the Churches themselves, the Seat of Ordinances are setled by a Divine Right authorizing of them; and further, that whilst any one doth continue a Member of any particular Church, he is so long obliged to the Duties to be performed by Members therein.</p>
                  <p>Yet 2. The unlawfulness of leaving this or that Church, and gathering new (which is the thing controverted) depends upon a further thing, namely, what, and how great (and that by Institution) the obligation of Members is to particular Churches, whereof they are Members; As if the Question were, Whether it were lawful for the Magistrate to tollerate Divorces and a Marriage with another; the measure and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the unlawfulness or lawfulness hereof to him, must be fetcht from the nature of the Obligation and Tye which in Marriages God hath made to arise not simply from this, that Marriage is God's Ordinance (for so the Relation of Servant and Master, of Subject and Magistrate also is, and the Duties, whilst that Relation continues, are by God's Ordinance, such or such.) But further, it is from the strictness of the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Bond of the Relation by God's special Institution: For though the Relation of Master and Servant, or Servant and Family, be (as was said) God's Ordinance, yet there is not that Obligation upon men for not leaving it and entring into a new. Let therefore the Obligation of Churches and Members (so far as from Christ's special Command and special Institution it may any way be made appear) be impartially weighed; for thereupon do the proportions and degrees of unlawfulness depend; both how far it is lawful or unlawful to the persons that leave the Churches, or to the Churches that permit them so to do, or to the Magistrate in whose Dominions they are. For a right estimating of the firmness or looseness of this Knot in which the strength of this Controversie lies, we propound these things to consideration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Obligation of Members to this or that individual Church under the Gospel, is far less than under the Old Testament the Obligation of Members was to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church: So that to take a Judgment of it, or an Argument from the Jewish Church against removing from Churches now, and gathering new, would (as it hath done many) much deceive us. And the difference herein is manifest, and also the ground of it; for the Church under the Old Testament was but one by God's Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so one, as there were to be no more set up, and therefore (though it proved Idolatrous) there was no setting up a new one. It was <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s sin, and the sin of the Ten Tribes, to set up <hi>Altare versus Altare,</hi> Altar against Altar, as they did. But now every where pure hands are, and may be lift up to God, and Spiritual Sacrifices be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where as well as in the Holy Mount; only we are now bound unto Church-Fellowship, and the enjoyment of Publick Ordinances as well as they, and so if we cannot have it in one Church, we are to seek it in another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence it will be (we suppose) granted by our Brethren, that it is a matter of much liberty (so it be done with peaceableness and sobriety) to remove from one Church to another for civil conveniences; yea out of many Churches, to set up a new Church for civil conveniences sake (as for Trade and the like, when a place is not well inhabited) much more for spiritual advantages.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take the outward matter of fact (in this thing controverted) namely, to remove and leave our Membership with these individual Churches now extant, and to gather new, if you take the fact barely out of some supposed erroneous Principle as the ground of it, or scandal and disturbance annexed thereto, it is a matter of Liberty: At least it is such as needs not a warrant by a new Institution or Example which is called for: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as such doth the evil and unlawfulness of it lie in crossing or thwarting an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Institution indissoluble; but only it lies in the manner, ground, or the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of it, which are extrinsecal to it: It hath been laid upon our Opinions and Practices, that we held Members of our Churches under so hard and strict an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to that end do bind them by a Covenant (yea it hath been affirmed by some, that we bind them by an Oath) as that they must remove when we remove, and by Divine Right are so bound up to Membership, to that individual Church they are of, as not to depart from it. This as we utterly renounce, so it will rather fall
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:154381:198"/> upon our Brethrens Principles, who would hold their Members under so great a bond, that though they are scrupled in Communion with them, and cannot satisfie their Consciences, they, though arising to multitudes, must rather want these Ordinances, than leave their Churches and gather themselves into new; This hard Imposition will especially follow, if they should put this unlawfulness upon the Obligation of Members unto their Churches, or Churches of such or such a form.</p>
                  <p>These things premised, we argue the lawfulness of this permission to be granted to Members; and it is lawful both as to the Magistrates Conscience, and to the Churches they are Members of to permit them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is lawful to the Churches and Magistrates Conscience, to permit us our desire of being free of the Churches (which is the case we in this debate have to do with) notwithstanding any Obligation to continue therein <hi>Divino Jure.</hi> If this Obligation of Members to their Churches were by Divine Institution, yet the Magistrates might permit men scrupled, to leave them, and be free therein. For, 1. Your selves have granted a liberty to Consciences, scrupling, receiving the Lord's Supper in the Parishes, which yet is a duty lies on them by Divine Commandment, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Our Brethren, whereof some yet hold Classical and Synodical Assemblies to be <hi>Divino Jure,</hi> have granted also a freedom for such Members as scruple the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of being subject thereto. Yea, 3. If any one that is now of a Parish Church, remove his dwelling to another Parish (which is permitted him) and consents not to be of the Church in that Parish he removes unto, we believe, that as the Law of the Land frees him from being a Member of the Parish Church he came from, so our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns Principles will free him from being a Member of that Parish Church he comes unto, until he doth give his consent so to be. Thus easie a loose is there for freedom of Members in respect of this Obligation, and so for the Magistrates Conscience to permit it.</p>
                  <p>But 2. If this Obligation were by a special Divine Institution indissoluble, as that of Marriage was (and as this is not) yet the Magistrates Conscience might permit a secession from it without sin. For so notwithstanding God's Institution was, that in Marriage the knot between two persons was such as man could not sever or put asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, yet <hi>Moses</hi> without sin, not only permitted Divorces, and so a freedom from this so indissoluble Obligation, but second Marriages also, and this all the Kings after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards also permitted, and so by like reason it may be here in this case. And this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance evinceth not only the permission of the privative part of omission of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with such Churches, but the positive too, <hi>viz.</hi> the gathering of Churches also, though both were in the Judgment of the Magistrate against an Instituted Obligation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the positive part, To permit new Churches to be gathered, of Members out of these Churches, the like Practices and Principles of our Brethren will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warrant the lawfulness of the Magistrate to permit it, but make it warrantable for us according to our Principles to do it.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. Some of themselves have gathered a Congregational Church out of many Churches, receiving and admitting upon their reformation, and forming up a Church in their Parish anew, an addition of Members out of divers other Parishes in City and Country unto the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and to Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in a constant way. If it be said they had not Sacraments in their own Churches, we reply, yet they had Preaching, and they should have remained Hearers in their own Parish Churches, till God opened a way for Sacraments there; for to this or the like Law would our Brethren oblige us unto. And again, constancy of Communion for Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Sacrament doth constitute them a Member of that Church they thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with, more than dwelling in the Parish, and occasional coming to that Church doth constitute them a Member of their own Parish Church. If it be said that this is <hi>pro tempore,</hi> for the time, and until such time as their own Churches are reformed, when they will restore them again. We reply, that so also when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches shall be reformed to our Principles, we will be willing to restore all their Members also, and will but relieve them with Ordinances according to their Consciences until that time; and will our selves then become Members of them. We only add this, that this some of our Brethren have done before any Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did warrant it, which may stop their mouths at least in this so inculcated cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour (in our Brethrens late reply presented to this Committee) against us, who went out of the Kingdom to gather new Churches without offence to the Magistrate.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:154381:199"/> 2. Many of themselves have gathered a Church out of a Church in a Parish, and that of the lesser out of the greater number. Our Brethren do account all that have formerly received the Sacrament with them to be of their Church, and Members thereof; for else they make wholly a new Church; and why else do they claim power over all, and proceed by way of Suspension, which is a Censure (the Objects whereof are only Church Members) and not by way of Admission? Now for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, and a few in the Parish whom he shall chuse, to begin to make up a new Body distinct from the rest, this act of theirs is either by way of separation and gathering a Church out of a Church (as they are pleased to call ours) or by way of Church Power and Authority towards its own Members. If the former, then we have our own Brethrens practices warranting ours: If the latter (which our Brethren by calling it Suspension seem rather to put it upon) we ask and demand, what Power Christ hath put into the lesser part of a Church, to take on them to suspend the greater part? And further, we desire our Brethren to resolve this Committee, whether they think not themselves bound according to the Principles of Church-proceedings, to proceed to Excommunicate (after two or three admonitions) all they do suspend, and so engage themselves to deliver to Satan, more than half this Kingdom in a month, if upon their admonitions they repent not; If they answer that they do thus take a few in a Parish to the Sacrament, and suspend the greater part by vertue of the Authority of the Magistrate: We reply, 1. That many have done this afore the Ordinance of Parliament came forth; And, 2. That then the Magistrate may not only permit, but Authorize us together a Church out of Churches, or at least out of a Church as well as our Brethren have done.</p>
                  <p>But, 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s our Brethren have gathered Congregational Churches out of a Church, yea Churches: So their Classical Churches are electively by picking and choosing made up now at first not of all the Ministers in the Parish Churches, but of some chosen out from the rest: Whereas according to the principles of their Ecclesiastical Obligation, the Ministers of all Churches should be taken in, but that would spoil Reformation. And yet if they will tye us to the Obligation of Members, according to the Law of particular Churches, that because all in the Parishes have Universally been Members of Churches, and so are theirs already; and therefore we must wait a Reformation of these Churches, and take them as Churches, and not make new; then should they by the like Law take these all as Ministers of Churches into their Classes, and trust God with his own Ordinance, as they account it.</p>
                  <p>If in the next place it may be Objected, That it is not simply the breaking of the bond of Obligation to the Churches of which we are Members, that the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of this consists in, but in the erroneous ground which we leave our Churches upon, as if you cannot enjoy Communion with them without sin, which errour therefore binds ye, as an erring conscience doth, and not to remove, and also binds the Magistrate and the Churches not to permit this freedom from our Churches, but to continue in them till they recal that error.</p>
                  <p>We reply, Suppose this an errour in the person (as the Magistrate who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded this Case doth suppose this Scruple of ours to be, and upon this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to resolve what forbearance he may permit) yet it is not unlawful for the Magistrate to permit them this freedom whom he judgeth to be in this errour. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Reasons mentioned before, your selves also would permit us to forbear the Lord's Supper without your Censure, and to be free from the power of the Assemblies, which forbearance yet you judge to be upon an unlawful ground in us.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly, to reduce this Plea of our Brethren against us to its right State.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We say, if the Question be about the Magistrates or Churches Conscience, whether they may permit it or no, (as the Question is) then it is not, whether this be an errour in these Members, according to the Magistrates or Churches Judgment, but whether it be such an errour, as they have warrant from Christ, so to bind it upon the Conscience of the parties erring, as not to suffer them to practise it upon their own peril and account betwixt God and them, after due means be used to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them. Our meaning in Stating it thus will be cleared.</p>
                  <p>If the Case be put as <hi>in foro Ecclesiastico,</hi> in the Ecclesiastical Court, if this errour come
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:154381:199"/> before the Church, these Members are of (and we hope our Brethren will not oblige the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates Conscience to more strictness herein than of the Church it self.) The Question will not be whether these parties do err in their Judgment, or whether doctrinally the Church may not lay before them this errour; and their grounds why they judge it to be so, and so press it upon them as a good means to reclaim them from this erroneous ground; But the Question is, Whether they are judicially to bind the Consciences of them that are in this errour of scrupling Communion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So as this sentence, according to the Law of Christ, should bind them up from practizing accordingly by vertue of this Ordinance and Power given the Church over them, though in the particular so judged their private Consciences remain as afore. And again, the Question is, whether it be such an errour as the Church is obliged not to permit them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in, or to practise accordingly, but is bound to retain them, and if they do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to excommunicate them. In a word, the Question is, Whether there lye an Ecclesiastical Obligation both upon the Church to bind this errour judicially upon Conscience, and to retain these persons ever, and also an Obligation upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the Church so judging to continue still as Members.</p>
                  <p>Now this we take for granted, That Churches will not take on them to bind thus judicially upon the Consciences of their Members, whatever they account an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous principle, nor bind them up from the practice of what ever they shall Doctrinally declare to be upon an erroneous ground, especially when otherwise the outward fact simply considered is Lawful, which is the Case in hand. And that this alledged is such an erroneous principle as they ought judicially to bind upon the Consciences of their Members, it remains upon our Brethren to prove; for when they shall take on then to prohibit a practice otherwise Lawful upon this errour, the burthen lyes on them to make it forth, to be of that nature as that they that dare bind it upon the Consciences of others to so great a prejudice to them, as to deprive them of the Ordinances of Christ.</p>
                  <p>But besides the expectation of our Brethrens making this forth, We humbly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent these Reasons why the Churches are not bound thus to bind this errour upon their Brethren who are Members of them, nor their Members thus scrupled, to be bound up thereby.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is not an errour of that degree of erroneousness, as should be the Object of such a judicial binding it upon their Consciences, it being but such an errour as comes under that Rule which the Assembly hath voted, that may stand with Piety, wherein godly and learned men possibly may and do differ, and such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours the Assembly dischargeth from judicial binding by Censures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, Our Brethren having granted that after due means used, they will not constrain (that is, by censures or otherwise) any that scruple Communion with them, and so run that principle, which is the foundation of what we desire, and do thereby grant that this errour is not the Object of Church Censures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Therefore they are not to censure this practice, neither which we desire upon this supposed errour.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For if the unlawfulness of removing from these Churches and gathering New, be founded upon this supposed erroneous ground of it, and not upon the Law of the Obligation of Church-Membership; and if it is simply considered in the outward Act lawful, then if the errour it self be not worthy of an Ecclesiastical binding, the practice founded hereupon is not, and if it be not, then may the Churches tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Otherwise if any Members of a Church remove from his Church to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon a mistaken ground; as for example, his not edifying under that Ministry or the like, which the Church he is in, judgeth an errour, hath that Church power ever to retain him, because his going away is upon an erroneous principle, so as they may not dismiss him, or have they power from Christ to bind his Conscience not to remove, because they judge him to do this upon an erring principle?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yea, we humbly offer it to consideration, if after due means used to convince men of this errour, when they shall find they cannot persuade them, they should not say as they to <hi>Paul, The Will of the Lord be done.</hi> Though the thing be against their own Judgment (as that was) and not only permit them to go from them, but assist them in gathering a new Church, according to the principles of their own Consciences, whilst they therein set up the substance of God's worship, and profess to
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:154381:200"/> hold all Communion in other Ordinances with them as far as possible they can? For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the general Obligation by Christ's command and appointment to all sorts of Believers to be in Church-Fellowship wherein to enjoy all Ordinances, especially the Sacraments, is a greater Obligation, than the Obligation that Members can have to any particular Churches. We are all sure that this general Law is an Institution of Christ, and absolute; and the Obligation to particular Churches is far less, as hath been shewn. Now as the Law of lesser Obligations useth to yield to the more universal, so should this; yea in this case men keep more to the Law of Communion with the whole universal Church, for they partake of all the same Ordinances with them, by which the Communion of the Church Catholick with Christ their head and one with another is more observed, than if in being deprived of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, they held Communion but in some things with a particular Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We humbly offer, that as for such errours for which Members should not be Excommunicated out of their own Church, and deprived of the Ordinances therein; For such errours, Christ's mind is, that they should not be deprived of them where else they may have them. If there were Churches extant of their Judgment any where in the world, why might they not be permitted to remove to them? as put the Case, when our Non-conformists were scrupled in kneeling at the Sacrament, or to have been present at the Liturgy, and so were deprived of the Ordinances; suppose this to have been an errour in them, to have scrupled the Lawfulness hereof (as we may well suppose, it may be the judgment of some of our Brethren, that it was an errour in them) might not these have removed into <hi>Scotland</hi> to those Churches where the pure Ordinances might be had? And then again, suppose there were no such Churches extant, were it not a lawful way of attaining to enjoyment of the Ordinances by making a new Church, such at least as the Magistrate in tenderness to them might permit?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the Primitive Condition and Differences among the Saints in the first Erecting Churches give not an Example, yet they do afford a principle of Equity for this. The differences between the Circumcision and Uncircumcision were such, as the circumcised Jewish Christian would not eat together with the Uncircumcised, tho' professing Christianity: How many years this continued, we know not, nor how long it remained in many mens consciences after the decision of the Apostles about the Non-necessity of Circumcision, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. But suppose it did remain in many for a long while, as appears by the Epistles to the <hi>Galatians, Colossians,</hi> &amp;c. Yet surely Jesus Christ did alike provide a way of enjoyment for Church Fellowship and Communion in Ordinances for the one as well as the other, though the difference in Judgment was such as the one could not eat with another. And that Christ's mind was, that both should have the Ordinances, though thus differing, is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>in Christ neither Circumcision nor Ʋncircumcision availed;</hi> and notwithstanding this difference (because it might stand with Piety in either) they all were baptized into one body, the Church Universal, and did drink (which alludes to their having the Lord's Supper) into one Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 13. The Apostles did labour all they could to allay this difference, but did they forbid either to make Churches apart if they could not be reconciled in one? As <hi>Peter</hi> said in the like case, <hi>Can any man forbid water to them that have received the Holy Ghost as well as we</hi> Jews? So, have the Apostles any where forbidden; or can any man forbid those to have the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in Churches truly Constituted, that cannot thorough an invincible scruple receive the Sacrament in the Churches they have been born in? Would not, and ought not general Counsels, if now called, if they could not reduce the Churches to one Rule, to permit each their way according to their several principles? And there are as great differences in the Reformed Churches as amongst us and our Brethren.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yea, doth not God profess to accept practices for the substance good, though upon erroneous grounds? <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, and he that eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not</hi> (out of scruple of Conscience, which was an errour) <hi>his not eating was to the Lord also;</hi> and upon that very ground he commands us not to judge them in so doing, because he accepted them.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="399" facs="tcp:154381:200"/> 5. Is not charity more seen in allowing to such tender Consciences those Ordinances which are of so general influence to build them up to life, though with the practice of some errour or upon some erroneous principle (which God will pardon, and Men should indulge to them) than for that errour for which they cannot justly be punished with Civil or Ecclesiastical Censure, to detain them from those Ordinances, by which they may be recovered and healed. This is as if one who had some Disease of smaller moment in probability incurable, and yet not mortal in the issue, should yet be denied such food as would make him more vigorous and fitter for all duties to God and Men, when in this case 'tis more charity to allow it him.</p>

                  <p>I intend in this Discourse to strengthen our Faith, as to the having Liberty of our Consciences in Times of Difficulty.

My design is now to state the Case <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Discourse of Christ the Ʋniversal Peace maker In Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>of his works.</hi>

                     </note> prosecute. For if you observe it, in both these Texts (as there are abundance of other Scriptures to like purpose) the consideration is of what is the Duty between Christians professing Jesus Christ, by vertue of Christ and his Blood. Those that would make this Liberty of Conscience to be extended to all men, weaken our prayers wonderfully, and do weaken our Arguments; for the hold we have upon the men, among whom we live, is, that we all profess our selves Christians; and we do not plead for Liberty to be given to Atheists, Infidels or Mahumetans, but we plead for Christ, and you will find the strength lies there.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We profess this Principle, That all Saints should be of one mind, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>That ye be all of one mind, of one judgment; I beseech you Brethren by the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ</hi> (he urgeth Christ too) <hi>that ye all speak the same thing, that ye be perfectly joyned together in the same mind, and in the same judgment, that you being of the same mind and judgment, may acknowledge this.</hi> It is this that all Saints should seek; and the Name of Jesus Christ should cause a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to the Judgment of Christians.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But if this cannot be effected, (if that be the case) you have the Rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15, 16. If men be otherwise minded, what then is to be done? The Rule is both there and here, Forbearance. When we say Forbearance, and cry out for Liberty, our meaning is not, that we should therefore remain indifferent whether this Truth or that Truth prevail; no, we are to contend earnestly for that Faith we think to be the Faith, and once given to the Saints, but it must be by Gospel means.</p>

                     <pb n="400" facs="tcp:154381:201"/> 4. While we plead for Liberty unto persons that are godly, and profess Christ, we do not favour the Errour that is laid upon us, of pleading for a Toleration of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies. It was long ago said by the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> that was Lord-Keeper, That it is an Argument out of the Devil's Logick, to argue from the Concreet to the Abstract. A man is sick of such a Disease, insomuch as that the humour of the Disease requires food that is in it self hurtful, and yet the man must live, and he cannot live without food. In this case what is to be done? you must preserve the Life of the man. Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in that case do so, and allow that which otherwise they would not allow. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose men mingle with the Ordinances of Christ Superstition, the diseased humour of their Spirits run out that way, you must for Christ's sake bear with them (for the man is in Christ, and the man must be fed and nourisht) you must allow him what is mingled with Superstition, without which he cannot partake of the Ordinances, and God will pardon the Errour, and bless the Ordinance. And in this case, it is not the Errour we indulge, but Christ in this Person, and Conscience in him, and we do it for Christ's sake; and if you go by outward force, and keep him from what would edifie him, you endanger his Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Who art thou that judgest another mans Servant? to his own Master he standeth or falleth.

The Apostle's Rule is, Though a man be in an Errour, you should be more earnest to regard the general End of his glorifying God in the substance of what he doth, than to punish his Errour. It is clearly the meaning of <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. <hi>He that regardeth a day, regardeth it to the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. Whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. What is the meaning? You are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the common Principle of Christians: There is a substance of Worship, and though the man err, yet you are to regard more what he doth to God, than you are to regard his Errour, and you are to nourish that more, than to go and beat out his Errour by a violent course. This is certainly the Apostle's meaning. The rise of what the Apostle saith in the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. is clearly this, that it was not a matter indifferent, but was about things wherein one side were in a great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and was in the wrong very much, (and I think <hi>Calvin</hi> acknowledgeth it) the Case here was concerning the whole of the Jewish Worship, though he gives In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances only of Days, and concerning their Sabbaths, and New Moons, and Meats that were forbidden. Now let all the World judge, if he that did abstain, did it as thinking it indifferent, and so would be at liberty; no, but in conscience I ought not (saith a Christian Jew) to neglect those Ordinances; they were given by God, and we ought all to be subject to them; they were not things indifferent; the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God was stated in the one, and in the other, so that it was not a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as they stated it, yet in this case, and upon this occasion, when matters did stand thus, doth the Apostle plead his Argument, as he does in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and <hi>chap.</hi> 15. The true intent of their meeting, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. was to compose the difference, by letting the Jews alone, to go on in their way, though they were in an Errour: And as for the Gentiles, to let them be free, only to warn them to take heed of offending the Jew; of all Scriptures, I know it is most abused; it is alledged for using an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, when as the thing is for an Accommodation. But as to the stating the Question, you find the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> flies upon the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and over-runs them, and that because they kept Days and Times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You find here, he pleads otherwise, what is the difference? In <hi>Acts</hi> 15. he tells you, there was two Opinions on foot; there were some of them wretched men, that said, a man could not be saved, unless he were circumcised, and kept the whole Law, <hi>verse</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>What do I gather hence? If a Doctrine come to be stated as in the Foundation of Religion, &amp; urg'd so, as it comes to a point of Salvation or Damnation, says <hi>Paul</hi> there, I will not bear with you, no not for a moment. He falls upon them in his Epistle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> to the height, stays not a moment: But come to the Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> there we find that those Judaizing Christians did not urge it by way of Salvation and Damnation, but went the moderate way, that it ought to be commanded, and that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:154381:201"/> it was <hi>vi Praecepti</hi> to be done, and he here pleads for Liberty, and that there should be Forbearance, and it is a great Argument; I will not say what the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate hath to do, but this I will say, the Magistrate is not to be more severe than the Church, unless it be in his own concernment of the Civil Peace; this is the state of it. So now I come to the Argument, the thing it self.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And the first head of Arguments I run upon is this, That in such cases of Differences thus stated, Christians ought to be equally minded one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Now the God of patience grant you to be like-minded one towards another, according to Christ Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. This being like-minded, is not oneness of Judgment (which our Brethren would carry all these places to) but equality of mind, or like-mindedness in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection one towards another notwithstanding Differences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 12. <hi>Be of the same mind one towards another.</hi> (It is the same word in the Original) that is, let the same equality of Love and Affection be kept up mutually one to another; let Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections continue to one another, upon the same terms. It is not spoken of One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Judgment and Opinion, but of Affection; it is spoken so, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 15. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with them that rejoyce, and weep with them that weep;</hi> that is, have like sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and feeling of one anothers Afflictions, and then <hi>Be of the same mind one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another,</hi> v. 16. and <hi>Have peace among your selves,</hi> Phil. 4. 2. There be other Scriptures where it is used for mutual Comfort, Agreement and Affections, equal Affections, and equal dealings upon it. That we ought to be so affected, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Differences, and that this is here intended, is clear enough. It is not only clear from the 14th Chapter, which comes in upon occasion of those Differences, but the Text clears it, that they should be equally minded in case of Difference. Take the 5th verse, it says, <hi>The God of patience and consolation grant you to be equally minded one towards another according to Christ Jesus.</hi> Here is prayer, and every prayer is usually fram'd according to the matter, and the thing that is required. If he prays that they should be all of one mind, why should he say, The God of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, God that is the God of patience, the Author and God of patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, work such a like-mindedness in you. If his meaning were, that all should be of one mind and judgment, there were no need to say, The Lord give you pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. If his scope were, that they should be of one mind, there needed no pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Truly they that impose need not patience, but those that were imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but he speaks of patience of one to another, and one is to be patient as much as the other: And truly there needs patience to bear with Differences, <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>You that are strong, please not your selves, but bear the infirmities</hi> (as Porters do) <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>You should tollerate and suffer with all lowliness and meekness, with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, forbearing one another in love.</hi> It's plain it is meant in point of Difference, that they should be equally minded to keep the Bond of Union in the Bond of Peace. The meaning is, while you agree in such things in which the common and great concernments of Christianity, and of the Spirit's working upon all sorts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are found; this is the Bond of the Difference in externals, and therefore bear that Difference with patience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A second consideration is from <hi>verse</hi> 5. <hi>According to Christ Jesus.</hi> There is a great deal lies in this; Take heed of casting your case of Tolleration into the common case of Turks &amp; Mahumetans, you then weaken your selves; for the tolleration must be according to Christ. We have a great strength and hank upon them that profess Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity to urge Christ upon them. Let them look to themselves, for tho' the universal Tolleration must have other Principles, yet that Tolleration which we seek, and which is according to Christ, and so is to move them from such a consideration sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing men to be in Christ; that Tolleration hath a great, a mighty, a strong Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which the Apostle here brings upon them. The meaning is, all sorts of Obligations drawn from Christ, which either Christ's Example, or our common Interest in him, or Relation to him, or the Nature and Law of having him to be our Head, and our Redeemer afford, are a compleat Topick for our Liberty. And let them come with all their Arguments out of the Old Testament, I will but only
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:154381:202"/> Preach Jesus Christ, and say, What say you to Jesus Christ? <hi>According to Jesus Christ,</hi> says the Apostle. He first urgeth what Christ had done upon Earth; <hi>Let every one please his Neighbour according to Christ.</hi> Secondly, What was his carriage since he went to Heaven? <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God,</hi> both Jews and Gentiles, with all their Differences. Thirdly, He urgeth the like intent Jesus Christ had in dying; <hi>Did he die for you of the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion only?</hi> He died for the Uncircumcision also; Did he die for you of the Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision only? No, he died for you of the Circumcision also, <hi>v.</hi> 8. One would think it should end the Controversie, but that men have a Zeal not according to knowledge: Now then out of all this being opened, take only that Argument, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christ, and you are compleat in him for liberty of Conscience; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks all the World must vanish before it.</p>
                  <p>My Assertion is this, That Saints, or Persons professing Christ, tho' they differ, yet being in Christ, they ought not to judge or despise, but forbear one another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christ.</p>
                  <p>In proving this Assertion, I shall keep my self to Christ, and use such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the considerations of Relation of Christ to us, and of us to him will afford.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And I begin first with the Example of Christ; <hi>Let us,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>bear the infirmities of the weak, and not please our selves, for even Christ pleased not himself.</hi> Do you know what he bare when he was upon Earth? Do you know what his Light was (for all the business is, men have Light for this or that which they would impose, and they think much others should not yield to it) who had Light? He that had Life, hath Light; Could all the Earth come up to his Light, if they were now on Earth? How did he shew his condescension to his Apostles, to his Disciples, who had great differences, great fallings short? He pleased not himself; for a person who had all that knowledge, comes and lives amongst a company of poor ignorant people, so that he was forc'd to leave the half of his Light unmanifested; and when he comes to part from them, <hi>John</hi> 17. he was forc'd to pray, that God would teach them to know that he came from him. Thus Christ did bear with them, when he lived on Earth.</p>
                  <p>I may shew it also, how he hath born with his Saints since he went to Heaven: He found the Saints (and so in all Ages) differing; some would have Circumcision, and others not; whom doth Christ take part with? neither with the one, nor the other, but receives all to the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>I pass now from the Example of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and I come to the Law of Christ, <hi>Bear ye one anothers burdens, and so fulfil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                        </gap>ing is true in him and in you, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.</hi> What is this Commandment? <hi>He that says he is in the light, and hateth his Brother, is in darkness even till now.</hi> This was true in him first, that is, it had its real existence in him; first, he made it good in his Example, and then in you, it becoming a Law from him to you; he performs it for you, and he hath given the Law to you. Now I shall but add this premise for the interpretation of this place. It is true, this place in the <hi>Galatians,</hi> comes in upon the occasion of the spiritual restoring and setting in joynt with meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, one that was overtaken in a fault. Says the Apostle, <hi>Bear ye one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.</hi> But let me say this to you, this is not a particular Maxim restrain'd to that thing, for it is a general Maxim, as the Apostle in abundance of places brings a great general Maxim for a particular occasion: Now it is clear in that <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. there is a general Maxim; we that are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak; and there it is spoken of a Christian forbearing, of a conscientious forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and here it is spoken in a spiritual sense. Those that are spiritual ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, in several ways, in Restoring, if one falls for want of Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the equity of the Maxim is one and the same, so that this Rule here, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 2. falls in, and is as applicable to that <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. as to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular purpose he brings it for, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. This premised, let us consider the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this his saying, <hi>Bear one anothers burdens;</hi> what is the meaning?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is to bear the burden we have from another, that is his meaning; What is burdensom from another to thee or me, this we are to bear.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="403" facs="tcp:154381:202"/> 2. Being applied to be all one in the general, and the occasion being but a branch of it, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. the meaning must be, that one Party is to bear, and bear the burden indifferently, as well as the other, for it runs upon equal and mutual terms; and if any of the two should bear most, it should be the strong; they are to bear as Porters do; who are to be Porters? those that are strong certainly, and if need be, they are not only to carry their burdens for them, but to carry the weak them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as Christ doth his poor Lambs in his Arms. Now those that get Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power in their hands, take upon themselves to be strong, and call themselves strong. Do they do so? Truly then they are bound by this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. to bear. They are to be the Bearers, and the more they take themselves to be strong, the more doth the Law of Christ come upon them to bear the infirmities of the weak. You see this place doth exhort indifferently to an equal bearing. Now then how unsuitable is it for those that are strong to run into so unequal a practice, as to go and lay the burden upon the weak, with all their Authority? And, that they may ease their spirits of the burden, they feeling the infirmities of the weak, will not come up to them and bear with them. In this case they ease their spirits by imposing those heavy burdens upon the weak; as it is plainly implied in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>Please not your selves: Bear one anothers burdens, and please not your selves;</hi> it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, it is the greatest pleasing a man's self that can be, to make others of my mind in point of Religion, and to see others subject to my understanding. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain you to be circumcised, says the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12, 13. and what is the rise of it? <hi>verse</hi> 13. That they may glory in your flesh, when you out of weakness yield they glory in their Victory, and so ease themselves. To be Lords of your Faith, is what the false Apostles sought for: To be Lord of your Faith, and to see you practise as they do in point of Religion, is more than to be Lords of Mens Estates, or Lives. If those men that are strong do thus, how do they bear one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burdens? how do they bear the infirmities of the weak? how do they suffer, or at least, how do they so suffer the weak, as the weak ought to suffer them? for they must bear one anothers burdens. Truly to see another differ, is both a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to mens corruptions, that would please themselves to see others of their mind: And it is also pleasing to Grace (simply considered) to bring men off from their Errours, though to do it by force and violence, is a Sin and an Errour. It is a burden to Grace, and a burden to corrupt Nature, to see another dissent; you all find it in part, those that are strong, and strong in power too. In this case what doth Jesus Christ and his Apostles call to, not to please our selves, and so to deny both the desires of Grace in that case that would be inordinate, and of Corruption, that would put men upon it. So much for opening this; <hi>Bear one anothers burdens,</hi> applied, falling in with that <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Herein the force of the Argument must lye; that this is a special Law of Christ; <hi>And so fulfil the Law of Christ.</hi> Love one to another was the general Law Christ gave, but to bear the burdens one of another, which is the burdensom part, this hath the Title of the whole Law, which christ hath given for Saints, to love one another is the special Law in respect of other Commandments of Christ; but for Saints to bear with the burdens of others (which is one branch of the Law) this is more the Law of Christ. If you would see the general Law of Christ, look into <hi>John</hi> 15. 12. <hi>This is my Commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you,</hi> verse 17, 18. <hi>These things I command you, that ye love one another. If the World hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you;</hi> which is, as if he had said, You Saints need love one another all of you, for you will have enough of the World's hatred, you need not lay Load one upon another; you need not lay Burthens, Persecutions, one upon another, therefore do you Saints see to this, that you love one another; I bring it for this, to shew that it is Christ's special Law; <hi>This is my Commandment,</hi> says Christ, of all the Duties of the Ten Commandments, Christ singles out this, to call it, His Commandment, as enforc'd from his Love; <hi>These things I command, that ye love one another,</hi> John 13. 34. Take it thus, says Jesus Christ here; I have died for you, and I leave this Commandment of all Commandments in special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to you, and I have reason to do it, for I bear with you, and I must bear with you when I am in Heaven; and if there be any Commandment which is more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:154381:203"/> mine, it is this, <hi>That you love one another.</hi> My Father loves you, and gave me to die for you; And, <hi>I have chosen you out of the World.</hi> But my Commandment is, <hi>That you love one another,</hi> John 15: 12. The Apostle (1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 7.) calls it a New Commandment, yet it was from the beginning: To love our Neighbour, that is, every Man, was a duty from the beginning from <hi>Adam. Cain</hi> was the first who broke this Command, and he hated his Brother for Religious respects; this was an Instance from the beginning of wickedness; nay, says God, I'll part you; and so from the beginning he suffered a separation; <hi>Seth</hi> came, and when he had Posterity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. Men began to worship God together, and they were sever'd from the World, <hi>Cain</hi>'s seed; how did they corrupt that separation? They should have loved one another, this was the Commandment; but this Commandment was clearly obliterated. Christ comes and enforces it anew, and, says he, I have loved you, and died for you, and this Commandment I give you; Christ revives it, which had been from the beginning, so that it is now enforc'd from Jesus Christ's having renewed it, having died for his People, and having born with them, and having given them that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; this Example past into a Law, a special Law; this Law of Love is enforc'd from Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is enforc'd from God the Father too, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 11. <hi>If God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</hi> This was to confirm the general, yet special Law, what Person doth he speak of? God the Father; look into the words before, <hi>He loved us, and sent his Son to be the Propitiation for our sins;</hi> You have both Jesus Christ's Law, and God the Father's Law, in this giving his Son, that Saints should thus love Saints; truly in the Old Law all the Ten Commandments had this, <hi>The Lord thy God that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> to enforce them; but if you come to this Law of Saints, Men that profess themselves Christians, have both Father and Son, and the enforcement of the Love of either put with an edge upon this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; This is my Commandment; (says Christ) this is the Law of Christ (still remember) to bear one anothers burdens: This is a special Law of that special Law, because it is the hardest of all the rest.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nay Thirdly, He tells us, the Love of the Father is perfected in us, if we love one another, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 12. God gains nothing by it, but you are the gainers, for his Love is perfected when you love one another. I would but bring this special Law of Jesus Christ to all Saints; this Love, which hath the Love of the Father in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son, and hath the Love of Jesus Christ himself to put the weight and edge upon it, and this Law of Love is obligatory to all Saints, and that upon mutual terms in point of Forbearance, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 15.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There was another Commandment left, and what was that? <hi>Have peace amongst your selves;</hi> it runs upon mutual terms, one towards another; he did leave it (you know) before he died; it is a strain he runs much upon, <hi>John</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Peace I leave with you, my Peace I give unto you;</hi> after he died and rose again, says he, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 19. <hi>Peace be with you, and among you;</hi> whilst he was alive he spoke the same thing, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. <hi>ult. Have grace in your selves to save you;</hi> and next to that, <hi>Have Peace one with another.</hi> And the case was this; in the beginning of the Sermon they fell out, who should be greatest, <hi>verse</hi> 34, 35. He ends the Sermon with this, <hi>Have Peace one with another: Have Peace;</hi> wherein doth Peace lye? Peace lies especially in taking up cases of difference, therein is Peace required; it respects differences, and all by this Rule, for Love and Peace; he foresaw that differences would be in his Church to the end of the World, and he urgeth this thing because so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both for the ordering and preserving his Church, for he could never have built it else. So soon as he went to Heaven, they quarrell'd about Circumcision and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision; had not the Apostles endeavoured Peace, they had never set up the Church of the Gentiles: For there was a pidling Principle, that a Jew must not Preach to a Gentile, and if Christ had not convinced them of the folly of it, where had his Church been?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, It is a New Commandment, <hi>John</hi> 13. 34. <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you, that ye love one another, v.</hi> 35. <hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another,</hi> John 17. 21. <hi>That they all may be one</hi> (that is, amongst themselves) <hi>as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that the World may believe, that thou hast sent me.</hi> It's called a New Commandment, because the most
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:154381:203"/> excellent of all the rest, as a new Song, and new Wine is meant, when Christ says, that He would drink no more of the Vine, till he drank it new in the Kingdom of Heaven; that is more excellent Wine.</p>
                  <p>These plain and transcendent Admonitions both for Love and Peace, have been given by Christ, because he did foresee all the differences that have arisen in his Church, and which did arise in those first Times, and therefore saw that these Rules of Peace and Love, were necessary to begin, and constitute, and then to keep up, and preserve his Church. He could not have set up his Church of Jews and Gentiles, much less have kept them in Peace, unless these his Laws had taken place among them. And such a mutual Love and Peace shewn in bearing one anothers burdens, (and this is to be exercised even toward all Saints, great and small, weak and strong, and this, tho' but a branch, is dignified with the Title of the whole Law) is so pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and transcendent a duty, as was sufficient to characterize them to be Christ's Disciples, with a notorious difference from that Love and Peace which is to be found in the World one towards another: And this Love and Peace is to be shewed among the Saints one toward another, with a difference from what they are in any way to shew unto the World who doth, and will hate them: Yea, it is to rise so high, as to be an Evidence to the World, that Christ is the Saviour of this World of Saints, and the Head, and Guide, and Inspirer of them with such a Peace, and Love. And this Rule of Love is to be exercised even toward all Saints, great and small, weak and strong; and tho' it is but a branch, yet it is dignified with the Title of the whole Law. It is past into a special Law above all other Laws; <hi>For this</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>is my Law.</hi> And it is the hardest part of that Law, to bear the burdens one of another, of Saints small, and weak, and yet 'tis called by the name of that whole Law, tho' it be but a branch of it: You have heard it is such a Law as Saints should observe one to another, they are enforc'd from the Father, and from Christ to love so, as no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the World should love, and with difference from what love they bear to the World. They ought to be at such Peace one with another; so to bear one with another, as no other men would bear with others in the World beside; yea, it is such a Love of Forbearance and Peace, that men may know by it that they are Disciples of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 13. 34, 35. We are to shew such Love to each other, as is not to be found amongst any sort of Men upon Earth, and such a Peace, such a Love, that it may manifest, That Jesus Christ is the Saviour of the World, <hi>(John</hi> 17. 21.) And do this to Saints, and to all Saints. Now truly, Peace is a fruit of Love, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10, 14.</p>
                  <p>From whence I may infer, That the Principles, and Practices of our Presbyterian Brethren, tho' Persons godly, do yet in this respect, not only fall short of this Rule, in degrees of Love, for all are thus deficient, but run cross to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For whereas Christ would have Saints, by vertue of their Christianity, to love all those whom they judge to be Saints, in a different respect from the World, our Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Brethren, even in Religious matters, extend their Charity, &amp; Rule in things of Worship to the generality of Men in a Nation. There must be a National Church made up of all, who are plainly the World. They will take in Men meerly Moral, and civil in their outward deportment, and make such Rules, and Constitutions of Church-Fellowship, as shall take in these, and suit with them. And by this Rule multitudes of poor Saints in a Nation are excluded who cannot joyn in such a loose Constitution of a Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Men do it for the World's sake, and to please them, that thereby they may strengthen their Interest, while they make up their Party by joyning with the World in Ordinances: Whereas Christ says to his Disciples, <hi>The World will hate you, but do you love one another.</hi> And now what then is the Quarrel between their Dissenting Prethren, and them? Their Dissenting Brethren say, We love you, and are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to joyn with you in the Ordinances of God, but you joyn herein with the World, which we cannot do. Upon this they cry out upon us as Schismaticks; what a terrible thing is this? They make up a Party in the World of those who have only a Form of Godliness, contrary to the Rule which enjoyns us to turn away from such, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. And contrary to the Rule of loving all the Saints, they exclude a great many who cannot unite in the Laxness of their Discipline, and act oppositely to the Law of bearing the burdens of such, and act thus in matters too, wherein they cannot convince them that they are in the wrong.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In framing an outward Administration of Religion for the World, as well as for
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:154381:204"/> the Saints of their Judgment, they greatly gratifie the World, and then it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if the World be at peace with them. For if they will own them, and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and admit them to their Sacraments, they have in Religious respects what they did desire, and for other things of Religion they are not much inquisitive; for so they have but a Religion, they are not apt to be scrupulous in things of that nature, and so they are at peace. But what is the peace which they have with these? It is but a dull peace, such as <hi>Rome</hi> hath amongst her Children, who go by an Implicit Faith, insomuch as there is little Religion, and little Enquiry about it among them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ut a man whose mind God hath enlightened, and who knows Jesus Christ to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Salvation, is an inquisitive creature, and must be satisfied, and it is his burden if he is not, and this burden they ought to bear. But they gratifie the World rather to make up an Interest with them, that so they may have peace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They do that which is worse than all this, for when they have joyned with the World, they make use of worldly force, and compulsion, and employ and call in Aid and Strength from the World whereby to compel their poor Distenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to their way. How contrary is this to Christ's Advice and Counsel, who tells us, that the World will hate us sufficiently, and therefore we need not lay Load up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another. But they joyning with the World, it will afford them carnal wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in this case, because of its hatred to any who are godly. And yet all this must not be counted Persecution. But I would ask, how doth the Antichrist of <hi>Rome</hi> persecute? Is it not by Imprisonment, and Death? And is not confiscation of Goods, tho' not materially the same punishments, yet a sort of Persecution too?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They do this for Points of doubtful Disputation (as the Apostles phrase is) for both the things urged by them, and the Power which they challenge to impose them are such. They are such disputable matters, as men may dispute their hearts out about them, and yet not prevail to a conviction. But oh! how is this such a Peace, such a Love of Saints to all Saints as should, and might distinguish them from all the World besides? for it is such a distinguishing Love, and Peace, which Christ enjoyns, as is not to be found in all the World besides. It is so remarkable a Love, that by it it might be discerned even by the World, that these are Christ's Disciples. How many differences far greater doth <hi>Rome</hi> the Antichristian World indulge to her Children in variety of Orders, Points of Doctrine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet these men will not allow a Liberty in smaller things. They will not use the same Forbearance as the Men of the World commonly observe one towards another.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They farther herein go against as clear Rules, as any are in Christianity, or the Scriptures, while they thus impose things of doubtful Disputations. Is not that a clear Rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15, 16. <hi>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same Rule, let us mind the same thing.</hi> We are to leave the rest to God to reveal when he pleaseth. It is another clear Rule which we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, <hi>You that are strong, bear the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of those who are weak.</hi> This we are to do to fulfil the Law of Christ. Is it not a clear Rule, <hi>That every one should please his Neighbour for edification?</hi> Rom. 15. 2. We should then follow things that make for peace, and whereby we may edifie one another: But when they act thus contrary to these Rules, they pretend that their design is to procure peace in the Churches, as if the only way to peace (which they take for granted too) were to impose the more common, and generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Opinions concerning Faith, and Worship, upon others who do dissent; and if they do not submit unto those Impositions, to restrain them from holding any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Assemblies, or enjoying among themselves those Ordinances of the Gospel, which may edifie them. If we look into <hi>Holland,</hi> we shall find a Toleration of Worship allowed to those who dissent from the Establisht Constitution. If we go to <hi>Turkey,</hi> the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> or to any Government of Mahometans, we shall see that Peace is granted even by them to Christians, by a Toleration, and Forbearance of them. And what? must there be no way among Christians for Peace, but to constrain all to be of one mind, and that in things of lesser and doubtful moment?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. They retain these Principles, and Resolutions, even while themselves are persecuted by other Protestants, who profess to do it out of the same Conscience, and Principles, upon which they themselves do proceed (only <hi>mutatis mutandis)</hi> and think they ought to do so, and that they do God good service in it. Our Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:154381:204"/> Brethren have been put by, and not suffered to Preach, as being thought not to be legally Ordained, or not to worship God as they ought. And while they cry out Persecution, Persecution, when it falls thus upon themselves, how can they have any secret reserve, or entertain any Principles to lead them unto a resolution to do the like things unto others whom they judge to be godly persons, and who differ less from them in Doctrines, and Substantials of Worship, than they do from other persons? I will only say this in allusion to that in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Wilt thou perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute under the power of those who persecute thee?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The most Moderate of them condescended indeed so far, that Saints unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to hold Communion with them, might continue in their Congregations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being pressed to come to the Lord's Supper, but it would not be allowed that they should enjoy this Ordinance in other Assemblies of their own. Thus it was debated in the Assembly, and the reason given for it was, such an Allowance would be against the common Peace, and disturb the common Establish'd Rule. And so out of Reverence to their Opinion, and Way, others must stand out, and be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this great Ordinance for ever, in Reverence to, and for the sake of the pretended Peace of their Church. The great business pretended is Peace, the Peace of the Church, ay but let them yield things conducive to Peace too. For the Peace of the Church doth not lie in this, that none must be suffered in any thing to differ from it. Peace doth not consist in this, that many persons truly godly must stand out, and be deprived of Worship, and Ordinances, for fear of displeasing them by entring into separate Congregations, which they cannot endure to see: Peace doth not consist in paying such a Reverence to a Church, that all who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from it must forbear meeting apart for Religious Worship. No, let us truly follow the Apostle's direction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 19. <hi>Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edifie another.</hi> And from hence these are the great things which may be complained of in the Case.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That some persons think Peace to lie only in mens quietly not enjoying Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances in separate Congregations, as if there were no way to Peace but this. But there is another way of Peace, in bearing with men notwithstanding their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Practices, and Judgments. Tho' one man keeps a day which another doth not, yet peace may be preserved between them both, and this is the peace to which Christ exhorts us. It is not as if there were no other way but this; if you cannot be of our mind, and if you will not enjoy the Ordinances in Communion with us, you must fly out of the Land for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. While they are so urgent for peace, they forget what follows, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 19. that we should mind such things whereby one may edifie another. If their claims for peace would hold, yet they run away but with half the Apostle's Rule, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all of it should be taken in. These Dissenting Christians should have the Lord's Supper (which they scruple to receive in your Parishes) for their Edification, for it is that whereby they are to be built up, and we are to please our Neighbour for his edification. Yea this is of far greater moment to each Saint, than that dull Tyrannical peace which is aimed at by a Coercive Power. If indeed those to whom forbearance is used, disturb the Publick Church Assemblies, and would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in the Ordinances, let them have the due reward of their Turbulency, for such behaviour is contrary unto peace indeed. But men might have peace, and others by them, and among them might have peace, true, everlasting peace, if they could quiet themselves in Christ's Rule for Forbearance.</p>
                  <p>All the Apostles when they were alive, could not perswade one Jew, though a Believer, to disclaim the continuance of the Jewish Ceremonies: <hi>Peter</hi> himself, and <hi>James,</hi> were of the mind that they should cease (as appears from <hi>Acts</hi> 15.) and yet they could not perswade the Jews to relinquish them. This was a tryed business, and in the highest supposition of Apostolical Power, and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and what Authority is there then now upon Earth sufficient to perswade Mens Consciences, when the Apostles themselves could not do it in a case of like nature? The Apostles professed that they had power given only for Edification, and not for Destruction. And what greater destruction is there than by outward compulsion, and utterly ruining men to tempt them to break their Consciences, or against their Consciences to refrain Religious Assemblies for Worship, and Enjoyment of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in them, which is the food of their Souls. Is not this expresly contrary to
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:154381:205"/> the Apostles direction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 1, 2. <hi>We then that are strong, ought to bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of the weak, and not to please our selves. Let every one of us please his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, for his good to edification.</hi> Truly, I will not now ask by what Authority they would do these things, but I would ask by what Charity do they these things? Why should they lay any godly person under that necessity, that he shall not have the Sacrament unless he takes it in their way? Why should they tempt a man to act against his Conscience in one thing, to have the enjoyment of it in another? What a terrible thing is this? <hi>Rome</hi> bears with their Children more by suffering them to differ in a thousand things.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they proceed in making Laws against us let us go to Law with them. Let us plead Christ's Law, and let us in prayer urge him, that he would put his own Law in execution. Let us pray to him, that he would cause his Law to stand, and take place. It is very seasonable to do so: Why may we not thus in Appeals to Christ by prayer go to Law with them? We have a more Antient Law, a special Law of Jesus Christ, who is the great Law-giver, and who hath the Executive Power, even all power in Heaven, and Earth; and hath he not laid it at stake for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of his Ordinances, and Worship to the end of the World? And he is our Advocate to plead his own Law, and our Cause; and Heaven, and Earth shall pass away before the least tittle of his Law shall fail. No, it shall all be accomplished in the World; and he will shake Heavens, and Earth, but he will do it. Methinks this should afford a very great deal of strength, and help to our Faith, that we may go to God, and Christ▪ and plead this Law, this his own Law unto him. Yea, it is not his Law only, but we have his Oath, and Covenant annext. He hath sworn unto us to this purpose, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 73. 74, 75. <hi>The Oath which he sware to our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hands of our Enemies, might serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a Judgment acknowledged and confessed in the case, and (as you know) execution if sued out, is to follow. In the year 1640. when some would bring in Bowing to the Altar, what was then pleaded in the Canon? It was this, <hi>Let not him that is strong, despise him that is weak; and let not him that is weak, judge him that is strong.</hi> This is a Judgment past to prove all that I have said.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 We must also bring them, and our Case to an Appeal in the day of Judgment, for thither the Apostle brings it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10. <hi>But why doest thou judge thy Brother? or why doest thou set at naught thy Brother? we shall all stand before the Judgment Seat of Christ.</hi> The Apostle urgeth upon them the observance of this Law of Love, and Peace, as they will answer it there.</p>
